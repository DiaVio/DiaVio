The driver and the right front passenger were flown from the scene for injuries sustained in the crash. A 45-year old female was driving V-1. She stated that she was traveling westbound at about 75 MPH in the left lane when another vehicle was in the lane to her right. She said that it looked liked that vehicle was coming into her lane. This forced her off the left side of the roadway. She then steered to the right and the vehicle came back onto the road and began to roll. She said the vehicle rolled about 5 times before it came to rest off the right side of the road. She advised that the right front passenger was sleeping just prior to he crash. V 1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
