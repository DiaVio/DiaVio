The road is a 5-lane divided (no positive barrier) concrete roadway for all vehicles. The road had two designated left turn lanes. These had separate lights with protective green arrows. The road surface was dry and there were no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Solara with one occupant, was traveling west in lane one attempting to pass through the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Pontiac Grand Prix with one occupant, was stopped in lane four of the eastbound lanes. It was waiting for the green arrow to turn left into the northbound lanes. Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Jeep Cherokee with two occupants, was stopped in lane five. It had the same intention to turn left as V2. V2 and V3 both proceeded with their left turn after the green left turn arrow was illuminated. At the intersection, the front of V1 impacted the right side of V2. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest partially on the north median, facing southeast. As V2 was coming to rest, the front of V3 struck the right side of V2. V1 rotated clockwise after the impact and came to rest within the intersection, facing west. V3 came to rest within the intersection, facing north. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene. The driver of V2 refused to be treated by medical personnel at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A 47-year old male drove V1, the 2005 Toyota Solara. He was heading from his residence to work using the same route as every day. He was not in a hurry and had time to stop at a doughnut shop on the way. He is in good health, was well rested and takes unspecified medication for high blood pressure. He stated he was traveling 40 to 54 kmph (25 to 30 mph) approaching the intersection. A delivery truck was driving 3-4 car lengths ahead of him. This truck was blocking his view of the traffic lights. He looked at another traffic light and thought he had a green light. The interview was conducted a week after the crash. The driver said looking back he thinks it might not have been green. In his account the delivery truck turned right into the northbound lanes. He kept driving and did not see V2 until it was 61 cm (2 feet) in front of him.
