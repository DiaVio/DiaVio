This single vehicle crash occurred shortly before noon during daylight hours on a four lane undivided roadway. There were two southbound lanes and two northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The roadway was dry and the sky was clear. To the west of this roadway is a grass area that leads to a negative slope hill/drop off area. The slope was measured at -155/122. At the bottom of the hill it becomes fairly flat again with cattails and tall grass and weeds.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 1993 Chevrolet Corvette convertible driven by a 52 year-old male with one passenger, was traveling southbound in the first lane. V 1, traveling at a high rate of speed, lost control and went off of the roadway right. V 1, bottomed out off the road and went airborne. V 1 came down on the embankment where it's right front axle was lost and it began to go airborne for a second time down the embankment. It was at this time that both occupants were completely ejected from the vehicle. V 1 landed with it's front at the bottom of the embankment and began to roll end over end. V 1 continued rolling and skipping airborne until it came to a final rest on it's roof approximately 136 meters (450 feet) from the off-road point of road departure. The driver stated to the police that he couldn't remember the crash and thought that someone may have cut him off. Driver one refused an interview. V 1 was towed from the scene the driver and passenger were transported to a local medical facility. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The witness to this crash reported that she was driving northbound and saw V 1 pass her at a very high rate of speed. She estimated that speed to be in excess of 145 kmph (90 mph). She then looked in her rearview mirror and saw what looked like V 1 turning off of the roadway where there was no road. Witness then made a U-turn in the roadway and went to see about V 1. She stated V 1 was already at final rest and the two occupants had been fully ejected.
