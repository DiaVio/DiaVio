This single vehicle crash occurred on a rural interstate highway with no exits or entrances near the crash site. The roadway was concrete with five level southbound lanes. There are paved shoulders on both sides, with a steep grass embankment median on the left shoulder. At the time of the crash, the rain was heavy and there was standing water on the roadway. It was daylight, but visibility was poor because of the rain. The posted speed limit was 97 kmph (60 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Suzuki XL7 was southbound in the fourth lane. V1 had just passed a previous crash, which was still blocking the two right lanes. The driver stated he was accelerating back up to the speed limit when his vehicle started to rotate clockwise. The driver tried to counter steer to the left, but the rear of his vehicle continued to rotate. The vehicle departed the roadway with the rear wheels leading, traveled up the embankment and then rolled down the embankment 360 degrees coming to rest next to the east shoulder on its wheel. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1 is a male of unknown age. This driver refused to continue halfway through the interview. He was traveling from one military base to another in the same area. This driver indicated that he had just passed another truck crash and as he was accelerating he lost control. He was driving his own vehicle and stated he was not in a hurry. The driver stated he thought he may have blew a tire. The vehicle inspection revealed the only flat tire was the right front. Tread depth and tire pressure were all within recommended range
