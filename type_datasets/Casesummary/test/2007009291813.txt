The crash occurred in an intersection on an east/west roadway. On the west side of the intersection, there were three eastbound lanes (including one left turn-only lane). On the east side of the intersection, there were three westbound lanes (including one left turn-only lane). The east and westbound lanes were divided by a raised cement and landscaped median. This was a level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 64 kmph (40 mph). It was early evening on a weekend and it was dark out but the roadway was illuminated by streetlamps. The roadway was wet and the sky was cloudy with a light rain. This was a well-traveled intersection and the traffic flow was moderate at that time. There was a slight left curve in the westbound direction.
V1, a 1995 Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, was driven by a 30-year-old female traveling with her 3-year-old daughter. The driver stated that she had been stopped in the eastbound left turn lane with the left turn indicator on, waiting for the left turn green arrow to turn green. She claimed she had been stopped for two minutes when the left turn arrow turned green, at which time she checked that her path was clear and she proceeded to make a left turn. As she began crossing over the westbound lane one, a vehicle in that lane traveling westbound (V2) crashed into the right front portion of her vehicle with the front of V2. The force of the crash spun her vehicle counterclockwise 90 degrees causing the rear corner of her vehicle to strike the left center of V2. After the second impact, both vehicles separated and V1 came to rest on the north side of the intersection facing northwest. Neither occupant was injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2005 Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicle, was driven by a 46-year-old male. The driver stated that he was on his way home after picking up pizzas twenty minutes prior to the crash. Prior to the collision, he stated that he had been traveling west in lane one at a rate of 56 kmph (35 mph) when a large dark SUV (V1) crossed his path from his left and hit the front of his vehicle. He stated that his vehicle was spun clockwise and the right rear portion of V1 hit the left center portion of his vehicle. His vehicle came to rest in the north side of the intersection, facing the center median. The driver was not injured.
Neither driver had time to perform any avoidance maneuvers. A witness told the police that the driver of V1 had missed the green arrow but that light was green for traffic in both directions (east and westbound). Although vehicles were allowed to turn left without the green arrow, left turning vehicles (V1) were required to yield to oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 was cited for failing to yield the right of way and driving with a suspended license.
