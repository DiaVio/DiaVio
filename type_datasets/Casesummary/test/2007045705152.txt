The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of an interstate highway that was divided by a concrete barrier wall. There were five lanes that were straight with a negative grade measuring 5.9%. Both right and left shoulders were paved. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry in the early evening on a weekday with rush hour congestion beginning to build. The speed limit was 89kph/55mph.
V1 was a 2007 Chevrolet Malibu that was traveling east on the highway when it began braking heavily for the congested roadway ahead and it departed the right side of its lane where V1 then struck (with its front, right corner) the left side of V2, a 1999 Nissan Maxima. V2 then began to rotate counterclockwise and departed the left side of its lane, then the roadway and struck the left (north) median wall with its front deploying its airbags. V1 came to a controlled stop on the left shoulder facing east. V2 came to rest on the left shoulder facing west in front (east) of V1. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a belted-fifty-one-year-old-female who was not injured in the crash. She had been on a daylong business (driving) trip from out of town and was headed home when the crash occurred. The driver related to the researcher that when she began to brake heavily (when she noticed traffic stopping ahead) that her vehicle pulled hard to the left which was when she counter-steered right causing the crash.
V2 was driven by a restrained-fifty-year-old-female who was transported along with her similarly injured (coded as incapacitating injury by police) right front female passenger to a local hospital for treatment. She never saw V1 before she was struck. The two occupants were on their way to visit a friend at the time of the crash.
