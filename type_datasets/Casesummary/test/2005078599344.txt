Vehicle one, a 1996 Nissan Maxima 4 door sedan (V1), was traveling southbound on the canal road and was engaged in a contest of speed with Vehicle two (V2), an unidentified light vehicle model Toyota that was following closely. V1's back was contacted by the front of V2 and V1 entered a clockwise rotation, crossed the dirt berm that separated the 2 roadways, then tripped over as it went up the embankment and over the dirt berm. V1 rolled left 2 quarter turns, and slid on it's top plane before coming to final rest on the roof facing generally south. A construction worker witnessed the crash events and also noticed the V1 driver exit his vehicle, and get into the passenger side of V2, who had stopped next to V1's point of final rest. The V2 driver told a witness at the scene that he was taking the V1 driver to a doctor for medical treatment. Neither driver could be located for interview. The witness was able to identify the make and color of V2, but no other information has been identified.
The owner of V1, who claimed to be the V1 driver's girlfriend, came to the crash scene and consented to be interviewed. She stated that the V1 driver had come to her house from the crash and had left her residence on foot. She had noticed that the V1 driver had an apparent leg injury. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1 and 97 kmph for V2.
