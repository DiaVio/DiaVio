The crash occurred in the right eastbound lane of an interstate highway that ran east/west. There were three eastbound lanes with wide paved shoulders on either side of the travel lanes and the eastbound side was separated from the westbound side by over 80 meters of median that was very steeply graded. The roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 89kph (55mph). Conditions at the time of the crash were overcast daylight with heavy rain and heavy right lane congestion due to holiday traffic for an area mall. The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekend.
V1 was a 1995 Toyota 4Runner 4x4 traveling east in the right lane when the driver noticed traffic slowing immediately in front of him and he began braking and steering right. His brakes locked and V1's front impacted V2's back in the right travel lane. V2 was a 2003 Pontiac Montana traveling east in the right travel lane at a low rate of speed when it was struck. V1 rotated 180 degrees clockwise and came to rest facing west about 5 meters east of impact straddling the south fog line.
