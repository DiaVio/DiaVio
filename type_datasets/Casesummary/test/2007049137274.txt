The two-vehicle crash occurred on a seven-lane, divided, straight, north/south roadway at the intersection with a two-lane, undivided, east/west roadway. There are four travel lanes for northbound traffic. Both roadways were level, dry and of concrete construction. The westbound lane has a left curve with a radius of 158 meters. A stop sign for westbound traffic controls traffic at the intersection. The posted speed limit for both roadways is 56 kph (35 mph). Traffic was moderate at the time of the crash. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear skies.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Toyota 4-Runner, with one occupant, was westbound in the first travel lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Mazda 626, with two occupants, was northbound in the second travel lane. V1 entered the intersection, attempting a left turn into the southbound lanes. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the intersection facing south. V2 rotated counterclockwise, began rolling backward and came to rest facing west in the eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 was transported from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a sixteen-year-old female, was heading from home to work. The driver is not licensed and has eighteen months of driving experience. She was listening to the radio at the time. This driver had been driving for about two minutes, drives the route daily and is familiar with the vehicle. The driver stated she had stopped at the stop sign for 1-2 seconds, looked to her left, did not see any oncoming traffic and proceeded into the intersection. She did not see V2 until impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers.
The driver of V2, a twenty-year-old female, was heading to her father's office from home. This driver had been driving for about five minutes, drives the route daily and is familiar with the vehicle. She stated she was listening to the radio at the time. This driver stated a non-contact vehicle in the first travel lane and slightly ahead of her position obstructed her view of the approach of V1. She further stated that she saw V1 as she entered the intersection and applied the brakes in an attempt to avoid the crash.
An associated factor in this crash was the sightline restriction created by the non-contact vehicle in northbound lane one.
