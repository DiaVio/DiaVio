This crash occurred in the evening of a weekend on a two-lane, two-way, undivided roadway. The bituminous roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph). A light rain was falling causing the roadway to be wet. It was getting dark when the crash occurred and there were no overhead lights present.
V1, a 2002 Nissan Sentra, was southbound in lane one intending to continue straight. V2, a 1989 Chevrolet Celebrity, was northbound in lane one also going straight. V3, a 2003 Ford Taurus, was also northbound ahead of V2. As V1 continued southbound it departed the roadway to the right, and struck a tree. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 300 degrees and re-enter the roadway where it contacted V2 (which was traveling in the opposite direction). Debris from the first impact broke from V1, which then contacted the left side of V3. All three vehicles came to final rest in the northbound lanes. V1 had to be towed from the scene due to severe damage. Both V2 and V3 were driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by an 18 year-old male, who suffered severe injuries as a result of the crash. There was one other occupant in the front passenger seat; he also suffered severe injuries. After numerous attempts the driver of V1 could not be located, therefore an interview could not be obtained.
V2 was driven by a 37 year-old male who did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash. A complete interview was obtained from this driver while on-scene. He stated that he didn't see the car until after it had already hit the tree, by which time it was too late to react.
