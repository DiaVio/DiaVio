The crash occurred on a primary arterial road that ran east/west and had five undivided lanes (2 east, 2 west and the center lane was left turn-only in both directions). It was curved north (if eastbound) with a radius of 1400 meters and was super elevated 3 percent. The arterial was intersected from the south by an access road that led into a residential area. That road was a two-way, two lane undivided road with a stop sign controlling access to the arterial. There was a business driveway intersecting the arterial opposite the access road on the north side of the intersection with no traffic controls. The southeast corner of the intersection had a private business lot with a level driveway that intersected the arterial about 25 meters east of the intersection. The access road had a positive grade of 8 percent on the northbound approach to the intersection, which was level. The arterial had a positive grade of 4.3 percent on the eastbound approach. The business driveway was level. The speed limit on the arterial was 72kmph/45mph and on the access road it was 48kmph/30mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry in the early afternoon on a weekday with relatively light traffic.
V1 was a 1992 Acura Vigor sedan that exited the driveway on the north side of the intersection intending to go straight across the arterial to the access road. When it had crossed most of the arterial it hit V2, a 1996 Mazda Miata that was traveling east in lane 1 of the arterial on V2's left side with its (V1's) front (Event #1). V1 then veered slightly left (southwest) and contacted a 2000 Ford Taurus sedan (V3) that was stopped in the northbound lane of the access road waiting to turn right onto the arterial on its (V3's) left side (Event #2 but damage not visible). V1 then continued south until it came to rest in a parking lot bordering the access road about 60 meters south of its first impact. After being hit on its left side, V2 rotated counterclockwise and hit the southeast curb (Event #3) with the right rear tire. This impact reversed V2's rotation and V2 traveled east across a grass area, where it contacted a large rock (Event #4) used in landscaping with its front right side. This impact sent V2 into another clockwise rotation and the left side tires dug into the soft ground and it tripped to its left and rolled 2 quarter turns (Event #5) into the driveway east of the intersection where it struck V4 (Event #6) on its left. V4 was a 1995 Toyota Camry sedan that was stopped and facing north in the driveway waiting to enter the arterial road. V2 spun on its top and came to rest on its top facing west in the driveway. It was towed away. V3 never moved from its stopped position and was driven from the scene. V4 came to rest at impact and was towed from the scene also. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a sixty-five year old belted female who was transported due to possible injury to an area hospital from the scene via EMS. She was on her way home from the store at the time of the crash. She claimed there was a non-contact vehicle in lane 2 eastbound that was a few car lengths ahead of V2, which must have blocked her view of V2 because she did not see it until impact.
V2 was driven by a thirty-nine-year old belted male who had the added benefit of an aftermarket roll bar on his convertible. He was transported with non-incapacitating injuries from the scene to an area hospital via EMS. He was on his way home from work at the time of the crash.
V3 was driven by a forty-year-old belted female who was not injured in the crash. She was on her way from one business appointment to another at the time of the crash. She supported Driver 1's claim of a non-contact vehicle present.
V3 was not involved in the first harmful event of this crash, so no Critical Pre-crash Event or Critical Reason was coded to this vehicle. No contributing factors were coded to this vehicle.
V4's driver was transported to an area hospital with possible injuries. EMS personnel assisted her from her vehicle.
