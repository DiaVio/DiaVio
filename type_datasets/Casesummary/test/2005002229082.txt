Vehicle #1, a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling north in the left hand lane with the intention of turning left at the traffic signal controlled intersection. Vehicle #2, a 1998 Subaru Legacy, was traveling south on the same roadway in the right hand lane. Vehicle #1 was waved through by a non-contact stopped vehicle in the southbound left lane. Vehicle #1 turned across the path of Vehicle #2. Vehicle #1's front struck the front of Vehicle #2.

The Chevrolet Lumina (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 67 year old female who was transported, treated and released at a local hospital with a complaint of pain. She stated that she had slowed as she approached the light and a non-contact stopped vehicle waved her on. As she proceeded to make the turn, traveling less than 16kph (10 mph), Vehicle #2 struck her, spinning her around so she was facing the way she had come. She indicated that she did not see Vehicle #2. Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage.

He stated that he was traveling south, there were two vehicles about 40 feet ahead of him, and she turned between them and in front of him. He stated that she did not have enough window of opportunity. He braked and steered right, but was unable to avoid the collision.
