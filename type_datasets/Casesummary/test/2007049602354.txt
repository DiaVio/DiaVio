This two-vehicle rear end crash occurred on a weekday during early afternoon hours. The location was a four-lane divided (no positive barrier) straight asphalt roadway. The weather was clear and the roads dry. The traffic was medium at the time of the crash. Traffic at the intersection is controlled by overhead traffic control signals. A green arrow protects traffic making a left turn.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Taurus with three occupants was traveling east in the fourth lane of traffic, following vehicle two. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Ford Explorer with three occupants was ahead of V1. Both vehicles intended to turn left at the next intersection. The intersection had a protected left turn. The green arrow was illuminated when both vehicles approached the intersection in the left turn lane. The arrow changed to amber and the westbound traffic received a green light. V2 decided to stop instead of entering the intersection. The front of V1 impacted the rear of V2. V2 moved forward over the stop line for the eastbound lanes. Both vehicles came to rest at the stop line. V1 was towed from the scene. V2 was driven from the scene. Both drivers were treated at the scene and no one was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A 34-year old female drove V1. She was heading home after she picked up her children at a school, located 800 meters (0.5 miles) from the intersection. The driver drives the route on a daily basis. She was not sure how close she was to V2 and how fast she was going. She thought V2 would pull into the intersection and turn left. She intended to follow V2 on this left turn.
A 39-year old female drove V2. She was heading home, after picking up her kids from the same school as the driver of V1. She was in no hurry and familiar with the area. She stated she had a protected left turn arrow. The arrow expired and changed from amber to a general green light. The oncoming traffic received a green light at the very same moment. The driver decided to stop instead of continuing an unprotected left turn.
