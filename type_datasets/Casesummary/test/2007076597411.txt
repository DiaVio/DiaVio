This single vehicle rollover with injury occurred on a two-lane dirt/gravel road in a rural area. This roadway runs east to west with various curves and elevations. The posted speed is 56 kmph (35 mph) with many areas having washboard conditions. This crash occurred at night time with no street lighting and no adverse weather conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Ranger pickup, was westbound at a high rate of speed when it crested an uphill grade then encountered a section of washboard roadway. The driver applied light braking and V1 began to rotate counter-clockwise. The driver countered the rotation with right hand steering and this overcompensation caused this vehicle to rotate clockwise and skidded off the right road edge. V1 rotated off the road and impacted a dirt berm and impacted a breakaway yield sign with the left bed area. The vehicle then rolled one quarter left coming to rest on the left side. The driver and one occupant exited under their own power, then rolled V1 back onto it's wheels. V1 was towed for roll over damage and two flat tires. The driver was transported to a local hospital. The passenger was not injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

They were having a social conversation prior to the crash and the driver claimed no internal or external distractions. They had left the driver residence and were just driving around with no specific destination. The driver was rested and it was his first time on the road.
