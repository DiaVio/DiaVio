The crash occurred on a clear, dry weekend mid-morning in an interchange area at the intersection of a roadway crossing over an interstate highway and an exit ramp controlled by an on colors traffic signal. The level, concrete, one-way, two-lane (with an adjacent right channelized lane) road had a posted speed limit of 64kmh (40mph) and a downhill slope >2%. The traffic signal had turned green and a line of traffic was still at a complete stop. V2 was stopped behind V3 in lane one heading northeast.
V1, a 1989 Plymouth Reliant, was traveling northeast in lane two at 40-48kmh (25-30mph) behind a cargo van. The 55 year-old female driver stated that she was uncomfortable driving behind a vehicle without windows because she could not see anything in the road ahead. The driver of V1 changed lanes to the right and immediately saw that traffic in lane one was stopped. The driver applied the brakes and V1, not equipped with anti-lock brakes, skidded longitudinally and then impacted V2. The front of V1 struck the rear of V2. The driver of V1 was cited for 'Careless Driving'. V1 came to rest in lane one facing north, partially in lane one, with the right rear of V1 on the right shoulder. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver was transported to a local trauma center where she was treated and released. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1996 Plymouth Neon driven by a 16 year-old female, after impact with V1, was pushed forward into V3. The front of V2 struck the rear of V3, a 1997 GMC Jimmy. The front of V2 under rode the back of V3. V2 came to final rest partially under V3 with both vehicles facing northeast in lane one. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver sought medical treatment from a local trauma center by private transportation, where she was treated and released, following the crash.
