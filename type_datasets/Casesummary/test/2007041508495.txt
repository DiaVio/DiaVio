The crash occurred in the southbound lane of an undivided two-lane roadway at an intersection with a private driveway. The north/south roadway had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). This was a straight, level, and asphalt street. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1991 Ford Explorer utility vehicle with two occupants, was backing out of the driveway. V2, a 1998 Honda Accord 4-door sedan with three occupants, was traveling southbound in lane one. Both vehicles were approaching intersecting paths. As the driver of V1 entered the roadway, the back right corner of V1 made contact with the right front side of V2. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The Ford Explorer was driven by an 18-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he and his passenger were on their way from the driver's house to get doughnuts. The driver maintained that he looked left and then right before backing into the street. The motorist said that he must not have seen the other vehicle due to a mail truck that was parked along the side of the roadway, blocking his view.
The Honda Accord was driven by a 41-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was coming home with his family from his daughter's doctor's appointment. He said that as he approached the upcoming intersection, he remembered seeing a postal van in front of him, off to the right side of the roadway. He was conversing with his wife and daughters, who were all sitting in the back seat. The driver was using his rearview mirror to make eye contact with them while they spoke. The motorist suddenly and unexpectedly felt an impact. At first, he did not know what had happened. He hit his brakes immediately upon impact. He proceeded to coast his vehicle to a complete stop, although his right front tire was flat from damage. It was then that he realized that the other driver was backing out of a driveway. He believed that the other driver could not see him due to the sightline restriction caused by the parked vehicle.
