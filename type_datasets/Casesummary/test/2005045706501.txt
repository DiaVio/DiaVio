The crash occurred on a straight portion of interstate with two northbound lanes at the terminus of a third lane / onramp. The roadway had a negative grade of 4% with paved shoulders. The lanes of interstate, north and southbound were divided by a median wall. To the right (east) of the northbound lanes of the interstate ran a drainage ditch. The posted speed limit was 113 KMPH (70 MPH). The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekend under daylight and dry conditions.
Vehicle 1, a 2006 Pontiac G6, was northbound on the interstate in the first travel lane when in an attempt to avoid colliding with a slower vehicle in the same lane (NC) it swerved to the right and went into a clockwise yaw, went off the right shoulder of the interstate and went down a slight embankment with a -5.2% grade and came to rest facing southeast in the drainage ditch. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Vehicle 1 was driven by a 34 year old belted male whose airbags did not deploy in the crash. He was uninjured in the crash. He stated that he was driving aggressively in the interview, both frustrated about being lost and worried that he was going to miss his flight. He said he came upon the NC vehicle as if it were sitting still and he only reacted.
