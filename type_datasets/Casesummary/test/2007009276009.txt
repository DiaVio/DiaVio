This crash occurred in the evening of a holiday on the southern roadside of a rural two-lane roadway. The east/west roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a wide paved shoulder running along the eastbound lane. The bituminous roadway was level but curved to the left (in the eastbound direction) and featured a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The traffic flow was normal but the roadway was wet from a rain that was falling at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Ford Escort 4-door with one occupant, was eastbound in lane one negotiating the curve. As V1 continued along the curve it lost control and began rotating clockwise. The vehicle departed the roadway off the right side and struck a tree with its front left side. V1 continued rotating and struck a second tree with its left side near the rear passenger door. V1 came to a rest off the roadway facing north near the second tree. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 22-year-old female, was transported for treatment of minor injuries. She stated that she was coming around curve at about 35 mph when the car just started to skid. She stated she hit the brakes and tried to steer it back into control but nothing was working. She said the next thing she knew was that she hit the tree was a little dazed.
