The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-lane, divided highway with a grass median. There were two eastbound lanes on this fully controlled roadway. Just beyond the crash location was a left turn lane leading to a four-leg intersection. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph) and a 1% downhill grade facing east. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was midday on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 2005 Freightliner school bus traveling east in lane two. Vehicle two was a 2005 Pontiac Grand Am sedan traveling east in lane two approaching V1 from behind. V2 was traveling at a higher rate of speed, and impacted the back of V1 with its front. V2 underrode V1 and became lodged underneath V1. V1 applied foot and hand brakes, dragging V2 126 meters to final rest in lane three. V2 had a minor under-hood fire after coming to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
The Freightliner school bus (V1) was driven by a 28-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries. She stated that she was driving from the end of an earlier school route to a second school to pick up students. She noticed a car approaching in the side mirror but did not think anything of it. Her estimated travel speed was 72 kmph (45 mph), which is the maximum allowable speed for a school bus. Suddenly she felt an impact from the rear. Her foot brakes were not operating properly due to the mechanics of the crash, so she used the emergency brake to bring the bus to a stop. The Freightliner school bus continued in service after the crash scene was cleared.
The Pontiac Grand Am (V2) was driven by an 18-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries. She stated that she only remembered turning onto the highway and doesn't remember the events of the crash. She thinks she may have blacked out. She was talking to her grandfather before she blacked out. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 96 kmph (60 mph). The Pontiac sedan was towed due to damage.
