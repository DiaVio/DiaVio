Case Summary 2007-43-174
This single vehicle crash occurred on a full-control suburban interstate highway. This brand new cement highway contains three lanes divided by a wire tension divider. Westbound approach curves left with a 7% super elevation, then straightens out as it crosses over a river. There are adequate breakdown lanes on both sides of the roadway as well as rumble strips. There is a metal guardrail that begins 51 meter (167 foot) prior to this roadway crossing over the river. Along the bridge there are positive concrete barriers present. The posted speed limit is 104 kph (65 mph). Setting was afternoon hours on a weekday. Conditions were cloudy with heavy rain coming down at the time of crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
V1 is a 2003 Chrysler Town & Country, minivan with one occupant traveling westbound in lane three. V1 was traveling the posted speed limit around the left curve with a high super-elevation. As V1 exited the left curve, it hydroplaned and started to rotate counterclockwise before departed the roadway to the left. V1 then contacted the metal guardrail with its front plane (Event 1), 11.2 meters (37 feet) prior to the concrete bridge barrier beginning. After V1 struck the guardrail, it defected and continued to rotate counterclockwise. V1 re-entered the travel lanes, as it was rotating counterclockwise. V1 traveled 86.2 meters (283 feet) after impact before coming to final rest on the left shoulder inches away from the concrete barrier facing southeast. V1 suffered disabling front-end damage and was towed from the scene to an unknown location, where it could not be located for inspection.
The driver of V1 is a 38 year-old male who was not injured in this crash. He had been on the road driving for 40 minutes prior to the crash. He was on his way back to work from a business meeting 40 miles away. He says it was raining hard as he came around the left curve at 104 kph (65 mph) in lane three. All of a sudden his vehicle hydroplaned and traveled toward the left side of the road. He departed the road, struck the metal guardrail with his front-end, then spun around one complete time before coming to final rest on the shoulder. He says as he was spinning in the travel lanes he thought he might have struck another vehicle but really was in shock and couldn't recall the exact events.
