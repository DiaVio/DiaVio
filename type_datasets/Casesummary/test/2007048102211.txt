This single-vehicle crash occurred at night (dark with no streetlights) with no adverse atmospheric conditions. The roadway was undivided and level. In the eastbound direction, this road curves to the right (the radius of curvature is 372 meters with zero percent superelevation). In the precrash area, this roadway is asphalt. This road then becomes a dirt road and had "washboard" bumps due to recent rain. The speed limit for this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph).

The driver of V1, a sixteen-year-old male, was on his way home from a friend's house with two male passengers. He was healthy, well rested and comfortable with his vehicle and passengers. This driver stated that he was traveling above the speed limit.
