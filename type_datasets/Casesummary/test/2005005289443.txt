This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a two-way, five-lane roadway. Traffic signals controlled all directions of the intersection. The roadway was not physically divided for vehicle one (V1); however, there was a divider for vehicle two (V2). V1 had a slight downhill grade, but the gradient for V2 was level. The roadway was dry, and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph).
Vehicle one, a 2000 Ford Windstar, was traveling north at approximately 24 kmph (15 mph). V1 then attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, but contacted the left front corner of V2. Vehicle two was traveling south, at approximately 56 kmph (35 mph) intending to continue straight through the intersection. At impact, V1 spun counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to rest in the southbound travel lane. V2 continued forward before coming to final rest, also in the southbound travel lane. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
