V2, a 2006 Nissan Frontier pick-up truck, was traveling southbound in lane one intending on continuing straight. As V1 neared the intersection, the driver decelerated and then proceeded to make a left-turn to head west. V2 was continuing south and saw V1 making a left into his direct travel path. V2 steered to the right in an attempt to avoid a collision. The driver of V1 hit the brakes and stopped in V2's travel path and the two vehicles impacted. V2's front struck the right side of V1.

The other occupants, his 14-year-old sister and 48-year-old father, were both also transported to a medical facility, each with "A" injuries. Since the driver was under the legal age, his father gave a surrogate interview. The father stated that they were driving home from an auto repair facility.
