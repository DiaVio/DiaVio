The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane secondary arterial road that ran east/west in an urban area. It was intersected from the south by a residential side street. The arterial was straight with a positive 3.3% grade 30 meters west of the intersection (if eastbound). The eastbound grade 5 meters west of the intersection was positive 5.7%. The intersection was controlled by a single stop sign for northbound traffic on the two-way, two (no painted lines) lane side street. The side street was level. Both roads were straight. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry in the early afternoon on a weekend. The speed limit for both roadways was 48kph/30mph.
V1 was a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am that was traveling north on the side street and as it approached the intersection it decelerated and turned left/west where as it was crossing the eastbound lane of the arterial V1 was struck on its left side by the front of V2, a 2004 Chrysler Sebring that was traveling east on the arterial. V1 rotated about 20 degrees counterclockwise and came to rest facing north 5 meters northeast of impact. V2 rotated just over 90 degrees counterclockwise and came to rest about 4 meters northeast of impact facing north. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a twenty-year-old-belted male whose airbags did deploy and was not injured, as was his twenty-one-year-old-belted-female passenger. The researcher was only able to interview the drivers' brother who spoke a little English (D1 spoke none). He relayed that D1 was talking to his girlfriend while intending to turn left he looked as he was struck on the left side.
V2 was driven by a belted-seventeen-year-old-female-who was listed as sustaining possible injuries and the researcher witnessed her transported from the scene in an ambulance. Her sister gave a brief statement but then refused further contact with either of them.
