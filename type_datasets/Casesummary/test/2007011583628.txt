The 2 vehicle crash occurred where a commercial driveway entrance/exit intersected a north-south, bituminous, 5 lane, 2 way, straight, level roadway. There were no traffic controls for the north-south roadway or the commercial drive exit. At the time of the weekday, late afternoon crash, it was daylight, clear and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit for the 5-lane roadway was 56 kmph (35mph).
V1, a 1996 Toyota Camry solely occupied by a 22-year-old female driver, was westbound exiting the commercial drive turning south on the roadway described above. V2, a 2000 Honda Odyssey mini-van occupied by a 34-year-old female driver, a 4-year-old male passenger and an 11-year-old female passenger, was northbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above. A non-contact vehicle was northbound in lane 1 slowing to turn into the commercial drive as v1 was waiting to pull out. V1 failed to see v2 approaching in lane 2 and turned left across the northbound traffic lanes. V1, front, contacted v2, front. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing west-northwest partially in the left turn lane. V2 came to rest in the left turn lane facing north-northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver and female passenger of v2 were injured and transported. Both vehicles were towed.
The driver of v1 stated that she stopped at the end of the driveway for about 10/15 seconds. She looked both left and right and saw the non-contact vehicle coming from her left with its blinker on slowing to turn right. There were also cars coming southbound from my right. I was trying to get into the center turn lane to wait for southbound traffic to clear. She said that she did not see the van behind the non-contact vehicle (a pickup truck). She was leaving work and uses that exit/drive daily.
The driver of v2 stated that she was in lane 2 northbound going about 40mph to drop her daughter off at her spouse's place of employment. She saw v1 starting to pull out and braked and steered left but could not avoid v1. She said she was familiar with the road and saw v1 before the crash.
