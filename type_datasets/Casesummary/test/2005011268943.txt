The crash occurred on a fully controlled urban bituminous highway, with two-lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median. The straight, level road has partially paved shoulders with rumble strips on both sides, and a posted speed limit of 105kph (65mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday afternoon crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2003 Honda Accord, driven by a 19 year-old female was traveling southbound on her way to work in the left lane at a stated speed of 70mph, on the verge of passing a pick-up truck pulling a closed trailer in the right lane. The driver of v1 saw the trailer begin to swing into her lane about to contact the right front of her vehicle, and swerved to the left shoulder to avoid the impact. The driver felt the rear of her car lose control and turned the steering wheel to the right to attempt to reposition her car back onto the road. V1 slid across the highway rotating clockwise and left the road on the right side. As the left wheels of v1 left the right shoulder, v1 rolled 4-quarter turns to the left down a -25% sloped grassy embankment, and came to rest on the wheels facing north in some brush. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The fully restrained driver denied injuries, and v1 was towed from the scene due to damage.
