The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west five-lane arterial road and a four-lane side street that intersected from the south. The arterial was level with a slight curve to the left just west of the intersection. The radius of curvature was 450 meters. The intersection was controlled by a traffic signal and the posted speed limit was 72kmph (45mph). Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon.
Vehicle #1 was a 2004 Jeep Cherokee traveling east in the second (left) lane. Vehicle #2, a 1999 Ford Mustang, was ahead of the Jeep (V1) in the left lane. Vehicle #2 stopped at the intersection for the traffic signal and was struck in the back left by the front right corner of Vehicle #1. Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 31-year old female that was belted with no deployed airbags. A 26-year old belted male accompanied her in the vehicle. Neither was injured in the collision. The driver stated that she saw the signal change to yellow and assumed that the other vehicle would continue through the intersection. About the same time the light changed her cell phone rang and she looked down at it. When she looked forward again she realized the other vehicle had stopped. Although the driver braked and steered left she was unable to avoid a collision. Police charged her with following too closely.
Vehicle #2 was operated by an 18-year old female that was belted with no deployed airbags. She was not injured in the crash. She reported that the signal changed and she slowed, somewhat abruptly, to a complete stop. She said she'd been stopped about two seconds when she was contacted.
