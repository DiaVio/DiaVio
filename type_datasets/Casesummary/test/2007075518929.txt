This crash occurred approximately thirteen meters before a three-way, stop sign-controlled intersection. On the north side of the intersection, the roadway is divided and the southbound traffic lanes consist of two through lanes and a left turn lane. This roadway is straight and level, with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). This crash occurred in the early evening hours on a weekday with late rush hour congestion. Traffic was backed up from a traffic-controlled intersection south of the impact location. The roadway was dark, but lighted.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Ford Escape with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Honda Civic with one occupant, was stopped behind non-contact vehicles in lane two, in front of V1. The driver of V1 was looking to the left, waiting for a break in northbound traffic and trying to determine if he could get to the store he wanted to by turning left at the intersection. He didn't realize traffic had stopped ahead of him and proceeded with the left turn; the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest near the point of impact, facing south in lane two. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V2 was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a forty-four-year-old male, was driving from his home to a department store. He was well rested, very comfortable with his vehicle, and drives this route weekly. He is in good health and takes no medications. The driver was monitoring northbound traffic and was trying to determine if he could turn left at the approaching intersection to travel to the designated store. He initiated the left turn and did not realize V2 had stopped again in the congested traffic.
The driver of V2, a sixty-four-year-old female, was driving from a store and going to her son's house. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle, and drives this route weekly. She considers herself to be in good health, but has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a thyroid condition for which she takes Lipitor, Lisinopril, and Synthroid on a regular basis. She did not detect V1 prior to impact. She had been stopped 5-10 seconds prior to impact.
