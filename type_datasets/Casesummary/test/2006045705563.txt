The crash occurred on a primary arterial road that ran north/south, had four lanes (2 in each travel direction) that were divided by a double yellow line with a gore. The road curved to the east (if southbound) with a measured radius of 363meters. The road was super-elevated 8% and had a negative precrash grade of 5%. The road was intersected on the west by a residential road that was not involved in this crash. The road had paved shoulders. The west side of the road was mostly edged with a heavily wooded embankment and a dead tree had fallen into the roadway about 37 meters south of the intersecting road already described and the tree spanned the southbound lanes. Conditions at the time of the crash were dark, unlit, with wet roads and heavy fog cover. The crash occurred shortly before dawn on a weekend morning.
V1 was a 2001 Toyota Camry traveling south in the right lane when it struck the tree that was in the road. V1 then swerved left into the dividing gore and came to rest facing south almost 70 meters south of the point of impact. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a twenty three year old belted male who was not injured in the crash. His right front passenger who was asleep was also not injured in the crash. The driver was on his way to a methadone clinic at the time of the crash.
