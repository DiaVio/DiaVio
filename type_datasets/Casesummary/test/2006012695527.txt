This crash occurred at a 4-way intersection with traffic control signals that had left turn flashing controls. The eastbound lanes had a downhill grade of 2.4 percent while the westbound lanes had an uphill grade of 2.4 percent. The posted speed limit was 89 KMPH (55 MPH). The crash happened in the early hours of the morning on a rainy day. The asphalt roadways were wet.
Vehicle 1 was a 1999 Subaru Legacy that was driven by a 25-year old male. V1 was traveling eastbound, and as it approached the intersection, the driver moved from the curb lane to the left turn lane. The driver reported that the vehicle ahead of him made a left turn, and since he did not see any westbound vehicles, he began his own left turn. As V1 entered the intersection, the driver noted a vehicle approaching the intersection, traveling westbound. He tried to accelerate to get out of the way; however, the right side of V1 was struck (twice) by the front of the westbound vehicle (V2). Vehicle 2 was a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer driven by a 33-year old male. Following the impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the second westbound lane. V2 came to final rest in the first westbound lane. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital due to his injuries. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 reported that he was in good health and was taking no medications. He does not wear corrective lenses. This driver stated that he was on his way to work at the time of the crash. He stated that he had the blinking red turn signal. He also stated that the vehicle that had stopped in front of him before turning had started its turn and he looked over the rear of that vehicle and saw nothing coming so he started his turn into the intersection. It was then that he saw V2 coming at a fast speed. He stated the only thing he remembers after that was hitting his forehead on the center mirror.
The driver of V2 reported that he was in good health and was not taking any medications. He was wearing corrective lenses for a myopic condition. He stated that he was on his way to work and that he travels this section of roadway everyday going to work. He claimed he was not in a hurry and his place of work was not even one mile away from the intersection. He stated that as he approached the intersection he saw the non-contact vehicle at the traffic light in the left turn lane. He stated there was enough space for the first vehicle to make the turn but not for the vehicle that he crashed into. He reported that the driver of V1 was talking on a cell phone at the time of the crash.
A witness to this crash who had been following V1 reported that she saw the driver of V1 on his cell phone at the time of the crash. She stated that she could she the approaching westbound vehicle (V2) and could only think "please don't turn in front of the vehicle" but the phone call must have been more important than the intersection. She also stated that the driver must not have been belted because she saw the driver contact the center mirror and then the right door glass. This witness was taking her son and a friend to school at the time of the crash.
