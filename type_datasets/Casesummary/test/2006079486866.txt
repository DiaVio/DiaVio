This two-vehicle collision occurred on a foggy weekday morning. The crash occurred at the four-leg intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal with no protected left phase, and the speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) in all directions. Both intersecting roadways are straight, five-lane, two-way, bituminous roadways, and there is a slight downhill slope approaching the intersection from the west. The fog was limiting visibility to approximately 100 meters (328 feet), and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet half-ton Tahoe SUV, was stopped in the third eastbound lane (left-turn only) at the intersection and waiting for an opportunity to turn left into northbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the second lane, and approaching the intersection with the intention of turning left. As the tri-light entered the yellow phase, V1 executed its left turn. As V1 turned, the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. Both vehicles moved west to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
