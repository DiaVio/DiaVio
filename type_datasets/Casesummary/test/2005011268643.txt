The crash occurred on the westbound lanes on a highway with three lanes in each direction, divided by a median barrier wall, at the point where an entrance ramp joins the right lane. The posted speed limit for the highway is 113kmh (70mph) for cars and 89kmh (55mph) for trucks. At the time of the weekday afternoon crash, traffic was heavy but moving at close to the posted limit. Conditions were clear and dry on the straight bituminous road, which sloped >2% upward at the point of impact.
V2, a 2002 International 9400 truck tractor without a trailer, was traveling in lane one going 89kmh (55mph). As v2 neared the straight, level, entrance ramp, v1, a 1999 Chrysler Concorde, was traveling on the ramp about to merge onto the highway. Due to the congested traffic conditions, the 34 year-old male driver of v2 could not move from his position in lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, driven by a 37 year-old female, came to the end of the ramp traveling at approximately the same speed as v2. The left side of v1 struck the right second axle tire of v2, as v1 entered lane one of the highway. The witness traveling behind the truck stated that at the last second, v1 swerved to the right in an apparent attempt to avoid contact with v2. The driver of v1 then swerved to the left, and back again to the right at which time v1 spun clockwise and left the roadway onto the right shoulder, and then down a >2% grassy slope. The front of v1 struck a cement wall which ran parallel to the roadway 12 meters from the shoulder. V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side of v1 struck the wall as v1 continued traveling westward. The front of v1 contacted the wall as v1 rotated clockwise again, and then finally v1 continued to rotate clockwise until it came to rest with the left side against the wall. In addition to the wall, v1 struck several small trees planted in front of the wall along the 15 meters between impact #2 and impact #5. V1 came to rest facing northeast and was towed from the scene due to damage. The driver of v1 was transported from the scene to a local trauma center.
An Associated Factor was coded to the driver of v2 for possible side effects of sleepiness and disorientation from his prescribed medication for high blood pressure.
