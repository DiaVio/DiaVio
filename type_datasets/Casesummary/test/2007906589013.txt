This two-vehicle crash occurred in an intersection of an undivided two-lane north/southbound roadway and an undivided two-lane east/westbound roadway. Curbside parking was permitted on all sides of the roads and signalized traffic devices controlled the movement through the intersection. The bituminous roadways were dry and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) for all directions. The crash occurred on a weekday during the late evening hours and standard overhead streetlights were used to illuminate the roadways. The traffic flow was normal and the roadways were free of any defects.
V1, a 1995 Geo Prizm 4-door sedan with the driver as the only occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one of the east/westbound roadway. V2, a 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche large pick-up truck with the driver as the only occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one of the north/southbound roadway. The traffic signal for V1 changed to red and the traffic signal for V2 was green. V2 entered the intersection traveling northbound and V1 failed to stop and entered the intersection traveling east. The front of V1 struck the left side front tire area of V2 causing the wheel and axle to bend, disabling V2. After impact, both V1 and V2 rotated slightly clockwise. V2 was towed as a result of the damages sustained. V1 remained operational and after the police review was allowed to leave the scene.

V1, the 1995 Geo Prizm, was driven by a 33-year-old male. He explained that minutes before the crash he had departed from some friends and was on his way home. He was traveling eastbound and not particularly in a hurry as he approached this intersection. He stated that he noticed the traffic light had changed from green to yellow but continued traveling, without stopping, through the intersection at a speed of 25-30 mph. He admitted to not paying full attention and having a lot on his mind, as he'd been in an argument with a friend earlier and he also has personal problems. He couldn't remember seeing V2 prior to the crash. He stated, "The light turned yellow all of a sudden and I ran into the side of the other vehicle. I slammed on my brakes but it was too late." He said that he was preoccupied. He was transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
V2, the 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche, was driven by a 50-year old female. She stated that she'd left home and was on her way to visit friends. While traveling north through the intersection, she was struck on the left front side by a vehicle whose driver ran a red light. She was very upset and irritated and had little to say throughout the interview.
