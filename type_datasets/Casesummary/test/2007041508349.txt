Case #2007-036
The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a two-way, six-lane interstate roadway, which was physically divided by a concrete barrier. There were three westbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
V1, a 2002 Honda Accord with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane two. The driver of V1 changed lanes to the right, into lane one, in order to pass a slower moving vehicle. After passing the vehicle, V1 began to change back into lane two. At about the same time, a phantom vehicle traveling in lane three had begun to change lanes to the right, into lane two. Both vehicles were changing into lane two at the same time, from different travel lanes. The driver of V1 jerked the wheel to the right in order to avoid hitting the phantom vehicle. The vehicle traveled off the right side of the roadway. The front right corner of V1 made contact with the concrete barrier. The back right side of V1 also made contact with the concrete barrier. V1 then traveled back onto the roadway, rotating in a counterclockwise direction. V1 rolled to the right, four quarter-turns, before coming to final rest on its wheels, facing west in lane two. V1 was towed due to damage.
The Honda Accord was driven by a 20-year old female, who was treated on-scene but was not transported to the hospital. She stated that she was on her way from school to home. According to the driver, she was traveling too fast. She changed lanes to get around a slower moving vehicle. She said that after the lane change, she attempted to get back into the middle lane. Another vehicle was changing lanes at the same time. In order to keep from hitting the other car, the driver steered to the right and lost control of her vehicle. She indicated that she hit the wall two times, and then rolled over.
