This single vehicle crash (V1) occurred on a local portion of a northbound street, underneath a railway overpass in the late evening on a weekend. Though there was no posted speed limit in this area, the legal speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph). The asphalt surface was both dry and free of any defect. To the north of V1's place of final rest was an intersection, where the local street changed into an arterial roadway that eventually merges with an east/west interstate. On this portion of this northbound roadway, the posted speed limit changed from 25 mph to 40 mph. The police narrative/scene sketch was inaccurate. The narrative showed the overpass as being an overpass for this interstate roadway, which is incorrect. Also in the PAR, two different and conflicting directions (east and then north) are assigned to the same street. There are other inconsistencies in the PAR as well.
A full interview was obtained from the driver (a 28 year-old male) within 40 minutes after the crash occurred. A second contact was made with the driver after the researcher obtained the PAR and re-investigated the scene for the vehicle damage patterns. The information on the PAR raised many new questions. On the night of the crash the driver stated that he was making a right-hand turn onto the northbound arterial roadway. It was during this turn that he claims to have been rear-ended by a "hit and run" vehicle which caused his car to lose traction, spin out of control in a southwardly direction on the northbound road, where it then came to final rest underneath the railway bridge. When asked what had happened the driver said (verbatim), "Felt like somebody...felt like I got nudged. And then I felt a big slap and then it just spun me around from there. I don't know what...what happened." The driver also stated that he "was just dazing." (Even though he later said that night that he felt "fine" at the time of the crash.) The driver refused to be transported or evaluated for injuries and the medic unit was recalled. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
The exact facts of the crash are uncertain but it is certain that the driver's description of this crash is incorrect. Upon revisiting the scene, the researcher found that the driver had in fact had a previous crash that evening. V1's bumper was found in an area 257 meters south of V1's final rest. Two huge concrete barriers were also displaced by the rear of V1 during this first and separate crash. Also at this site was the metal chain link fence that accounted for the damage along V1's right and left 'C' pillars. When this researcher contacted the driver to inquire about these newly learned facts, the driver was either unaware of the true events of that evening or unwilling to disclose the fact that he was in this area. Given that this local northbound portion of roadway is a dead-end at nighttime, and that many illegal activities take place there, it is more likely that the driver did not want to disclose the real facts of this crash. It is the conclusion of this researcher that the driver was trying to leave the scene of his first accident to avoid explaining what he was doing in the area of the original crash. The "hit and run" vehicle which was reported to the police officer and researcher was a poor attempt to account for damage to the rear of this vehicle.
