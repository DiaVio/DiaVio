The crash occurred on a one-way, three-lane road that runs westbound only and intersected a north/south road and two entrance ramps on to fully controlled highways. The one-way road was straight with a left turn only lane, a left/ straight lane and a right/ straight lane. At over 100 meters pre crash it had a negative grade of four percent. There was a painted gore separating the straight/ right lane from the straight/ left lane. The north/ south road had four lanes where it intersected from the north side and three where it intersected from the south. The first ramp was situated on the southwest side of the intersection and provided access to an interstate highway. The straight/ left turn lane for the one-way road was the only proper access to this ramp. The second ramp was on the northwest side of the intersection and provided access to a US Highway. The intersection was level and controlled by traffic lights with pedestrian signals. The posted speed limit on the one-way road was 48kph (30mph). The crash occurred in the morning on a weekday after rush hour under clear weather conditions.
Vehicle #1 was a 1989 Chevrolet dually pickup with four-wheel drive that was in the straight/ right lane (lane 1) on the one-way road. It attempted to change lanes to the left to enter the straight/ left lane and get on to the interstate ramp. When Vehicle #1 moved to its left it crossed the painted gore and struck Vehicle #2, a 1993 Isuzu Rodeo that was traveling in the straight/ left lane, with its (V1's) left front corner. Vehicle #1 struck Vehicle #2 in the right rear corner causing Vehicle #2 to yaw clockwise and roll four quarter turns and land upright in it's original lane facing northeast on the west side of the intersection. The driver of Vehicle #1 regained control of his vehicle and drove it to the left shoulder of the interstate on ramp. Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage and Vehicle #1 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
