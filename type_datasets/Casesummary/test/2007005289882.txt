This two-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon hours on a weekday, in the middle of a four-way residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a three-lane roadway on the west side of the intersection and a four-lane roadway on the east side of the intersection, which was intersected by a two-lane north/south roadway. All four directions of the intersection were controlled by traffic lights. The bituminous roadways were straight and wet. The eastbound traffic upon which vehicle one (V1) was traveling had a slight downhill grade, while the southbound traffic upon which vehicle two (V2) was traveling was level. The posted speed limit for V1 was 72kmph (45mph), and the posted speed limit for V2 was 64kmph (40mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle one, a 1993 Nissan Pathfinder, was heading east on the roadway intending to continue through the intersection. Vehicle two, a 2007 Lincoln MKZ was heading south on the roadway, also intending to continue through the intersection. The front of V1 contacted the right front of V2. Vehicle one then rotated clockwise while V2 rotated counterclockwise, and the left rear of V1 struck the right rear of V2 in a side slap impact. V1 continued off the right side of the roadway coming to final rest in the middle of a residential lawn, facing east. Vehicle two came to final rest in the eastbound roadway facing northeast. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to vehicle damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 20 year-old male, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was conducted with this driver via telephone. He relayed that he went through the intersection at approximately 40kmph (25mph) and saw the other vehicle as he entered the intersection. He tried to brake and steer to the right, however, he could not avoid the crash. He claimed he was driving this portion of the trip for approximately 20 minutes and did not feel fatigued. He stated he was familiar with the area and drives on the roadway weekly. The driver claimed he was in good health, however, he does suffer from Crohn's disease. At the time of the crash he was taking medications to help his symptoms. He did not feel his condition affected his driving. The driver also relayed that his vehicle was in good driving condition and that no mechanical problems contributed to this crash. The driver told police that he thought he had a green light.
The driver of V2, a 47 year-old female, suffered possible injuries as a result of the crash, but did not require transport to a medical facility. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle via telephone. She related that she was approaching the intersection and that there were no cars in front of her. The light was red at the time so she started to slow down. Before she reached the intersection, however, the light had turned to green so she began to speed up. As she entered the intersection she was hit on the right side of the vehicle. She claimed that she never saw the other vehicle approaching. At the time of impact she thought she was going approximately 64kmph (40mph). The driver claimed she was in good health but was taking an allergy medication as well as an antidepressant. In addition, she said that she takes a daily vitamin. She was very familiar with the roadway and was only driving approximately 5 minutes when the crash occurred. The driver only had the car for about a month but felt comfortable driving it. So much so that after the crash she went and got the same exact car. She was not fatigued when this crash occurred.
