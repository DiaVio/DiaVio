This collision occurred on a Monday at approximately 2200 hours on a rural stretch of roadway. It involved a passenger car that departed the left side of the roadway and struck a tree. The road is a rural two-way, three lane, divided bituminous roadway that is straight and level. The speed limit is 45 mph (72 kph).
V1, a 2002 Oldsmobile Alero sedan with one occupant (a 16-year-old male), was traveling east in lane one. From physical evidence the driver locked up the rear brakes and the vehicle initiated a counterclockwise rotation as it crossed the roadway and entered the grass/dirt roadside. The front of the vehicle swiped a small metal pole before the right side of the vehicle struck a tree where it came to rest. The driver sustained minor injuries and was not transported. The vehicle was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Physical evidence at the scene show tire marks from the rear wheels only as the vehicle initiated the counterclockwise rotation before it ran off the left road edge. The marks begin in the eastbound lane. The driver attempted some maneuver by locking up the rear brakes of the vehicle using the emergency brake where he lost control. He could not explain what happened when interviewed.
