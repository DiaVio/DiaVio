This single vehicle crash occurred on a weekend morning on a clear, two-lane undivided roadway in a rural neighborhood. The roadway runs north and south with curves to the left and right throughout its path. The posted speed limit is 45 mph (72 kmph) at the location of the crash; and there is a soft curve to the left in road for southbound traffic.
Vehicle 1, a 1992 Toyota Camry, was traveling south while negotiating curves in the road. V1 departed the right side of road, reentered the roadway, and fishtailed almost 50 meters before finally leaving the roadway on the left side and striking a tree with its right front corner. The vehicle came to final rest at the point of impact and had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 is a 17-year-old female high school student on summer break. She is not working this summer and has a normal sleep schedule of 8 and a half hours a day. She completed her basic driver training at a high school one year ago and currently owns a Level 3 Graduated Driver License, which limits the number of passengers she is allowed to have in her vehicle.
She woke up an hour earlier than normal this morning because she had to go to church. The church is less than 3 miles from her home and she began her trip. As she traveled south on a 2-lane rural road, she reached for some compact disks that were in a CD holder. As she was messing with the CD's, the road began to curve to the left and her car departed the road on the right side. Once she realized she had drifted off the roadway, she jerked the steering wheel to the left and reentered the roadway, however, she entered the northbound lane and jerked the steering wheel back to right. By this time, she could not regain control of her vehicle and she pulled the car back to the left. The final left-pulling action caused her vehicle to depart the left side of the roadway and strike a tree (18 cm in diameter) with her right front corner. This driver was protected by a lap and shoulder belt and a driver side airbag that deployed. She was treated on the scene by EMS for a small laceration to the inside of her left arm.
