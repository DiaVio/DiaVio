This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a two-way, two-lane, roadway. The crash took place in the evening hours of a weekday and there were no streetlights illuminating the road. No adverse atmospheric conditions were present and the roadway was dry at the time of the collision. The grade for both vehicles was determined to be level. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 64kph (40mph).
V1, a 2002 Toyota Highlander, was traveling east on the roadway approaching his driveway. V2, a 2006 Toyota Scion, was traveling west on the roadway intending to continue straight. As the driver of V2 maneuvered his vehicle into position to back into his driveway his right front collided with the front left of V2. The impact caused V1 to rotate counter-clockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to final rest. V2 continued in a forward motion shortly before coming to final rest. Both vehicles had to be removed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
The driver of V1, an older male, was not injured as a result of the crash. There were no other occupants present in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A partial interview was obtained from the driver while on-scene. The interview revealed that the driver crossed over the double yellow line, in order to position his vehicle so that he could back into his driveway.
The driver of V2 could not be contacted for an interview. It is unknown if any injuries were sustained by this driver. No Police Accident Report could be obtained from the station that had jurisdiction over this crash. Therefore, most of the information could not be coded. One possible factor that the researcher suspected was that of the other vehicle's color. The other vehicle was black, and it was dark with no streetlights of any kind. Further, since the other vehicle was positioned in a way where the headlights were not facing this driver, it may have been difficult to see.
