As V1 came over the crest of road V1 driver and V1 passenger became distracted by pedestrians who were walking to their right side on the north sidewalk. When the driver's gaze returned to the roadway he saw that traffic was coming to a crawl. The driver braked hard and steered left into the center turn lane to avoid striking the vehicle in front of him. V1 continued left and it partially entered lane two of the westbound side of the roadway sideswiping V2, a 1999 Ford Contour with two occupants. After this impact, V1 steered back into the middle divider lane and came to a semi-controlled stop. V2 rotated approximately 30 degrees and was then struck on its right side front by the front left corner of V3, a 1998 F150 pick-up with one occupant. V2 then crossed lane one and partially departed the roadway before coming to final rest. V3 had been traveling directly behind V2 in lane two and after V2 was initially struck by V1, V2 steered right and braked and was then struck on its right side front by the front side left of V4, a 1997 Ford Explorer with one occupant. After V3 was struck by V4, V3 also crossed lane one and departed the roadway to its right where it struck a tree with its front side left and came to final rest. V4 had been traveling in lane one of the east/westbound roadway and after V4 struck V3, V4 then partially departed the roadway to the right where it struck a tree with its right side front and came to its final rest. V2 and V4 were towed from the scene while V1 and V3 were driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

When V1 driver returned his attention to the roadway he noticed that all traffic in front of him was slowing and he knew that he did not have time to stop. In an attempt to avoid striking the vehicle directly in front of him in his lane, V1 driver applied his brakes and steered left but was unable to maintain full control of his vehicle. V1 driver's intent was to bring his vehicle to controlled stop in the center turn lane.
