This 2-vehicle crash occurred within a "T" type intersection in a rural area during daylight hours while raining. The straight three-lane east/westbound roadway included a center left turn lane and was on a slight downhill grade for westbound traffic. The straight two-lane north/southbound roadway was on a steeper downhill grade for southbound traffic and was controlled by a stop sign. Both roadways were asphalt constructed and wet at the time of the crash. The speed limit for the through roadway was 80 kph (50 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero sedan driven by a 20 year-old female with one passenger was traveling southbound beginning a left hand turn (eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Chevrolet K-1500 pickup driven by a 66 year-old male was traveling westbound in the #1 lane when the driver saw V1 beginning to pull out from the side street. The driver of V2 tapped on his brakes and steered left slightly but could not avoid V1 because of oncoming traffic. The front of V2 struck the front of V1. At impact, V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing north off the right side of the traffic lane in the intersection. V2 came to rest in the center turn lane facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene after the flat tire was changed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
