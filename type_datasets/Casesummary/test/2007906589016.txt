This two-vehicle crash occurred in an intersection where a two-lane north/south roadway intersected with a two-lane east/west roadway. Each roadway was physically undivided; only double yellow lines separated each direction. On the north/south roadway, there were no traffic control devices. East/west traffic was controlled by stop signs. The bituminous roadways were dry and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) for all directions. The crash occurred on a weekday during the late afternoon daylight hours. The traffic flow was normal and the roadways were free of any noticeable defects.
V1, a 1992 Buick LeSabre 4-door sedan with the driver as the only occupant, was traveling southbound on the north/south roadway. When the driver attempted to make a left turn onto the eastbound roadway, the front of V1 contacted the front right of V2, a 1991 Buick Park Avenue 4-door sedan traveling northbound in the opposite direction attempting to go straight through the same intersection. After the initial impact, V1 traveled a few feet and rotated counterclockwise where it came to final rest facing eastward. After contact with V1, V2 rotated clockwise slightly where it came to final rest continuing to face northward. Both vehicles were towed from the scene from damages sustained. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 21-year old male, said he was traveling southbound at about 30 mph and needed to turn left down the slanted street. He did not see the other vehicle coming in the opposite direction, so he continued to turn left and the two vehicles collided. He had been in an argument with his girlfriend a few hours before and was thinking about it. He had been a licensed driver for only four years and traveled on this roadway daily. The police report stated that this driver was supposed to yield to oncoming traffic. He was transported to the hospital from the scene by medics.
The driver of V2, a 22-year old female, stated she was traveling northbound and saw the other vehicle suddenly make a left turn and there was nothing she could do. She slammed on her brakes but it was too late. She was talking to her passengers; however, she said she was not distracted. She and her two passengers were transported to the hospital by medics.
