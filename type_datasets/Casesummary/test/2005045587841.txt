The crash occurred on a north/south four lane urban business roadway with center two way left turn lane. There was a signal controlled intersection 53m south of impact with private drives present on the west side of the road. The road curves slightly (radius 750m) to the east (left) as it travels southward with a posted speed of 64kmph (40mph). Conditions were daylight and cloudy on a weekday evening. Thunderstorms were in the area, but it hadn't begun to rain when the crash took place.
Vehicle #1 was a 2004 Toyota Tacoma pickup attempting to exit a private drive on the west side of the road. Vehicle #2, a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant, was southbound in the left lane. Traffic was stopped in the right lane for the signal ahead and the driver of a non-contact vehicle (Dodge Durango SUV) motioned for Vehicle #1 to turn left across the southbound lanes in front of them. Vehicle #1 initiated the turn and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle #2. Both vehicles came to rest near impact and were towed due to damage. Neither driver received medical treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 21-year-old male that was belted with no deployed airbags. He stated that the non-contact vehicle allowed another sport utility vehicle that was ahead of him to turn left, and then motioned him across. The non-contact vehicle restricted his view and he didn't see Vehicle #2.
Vehicle #2 was operated by a 44-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags. She stated that she didn't see Vehicle #1 until impact and made no avoidance actions. Police issued her a citation for driving on a revoked license.
