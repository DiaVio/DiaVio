This two-vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a three-lane roadway divided by a raised curb median. There were three southbound lanes and four northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred in the early morning hours of a weekday. The road was dry and the skies were cloudy.
V1, a 2003 Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. V2, a 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse two-door with one occupant, had just completed a U-turn from the northbound left-turn lane into southbound lane 2. A non-contact vehicle was in lane 2 and had to slow to avoid a collision with V2. V2's intention was to get in lane 1 and turn right into the driveway of a gas station. V2, driving behind the non-contact vehicle and to the right in lane 1, saw the non-contact vehicle slow, and then V2 suddenly pulled out from in front of the non-contact vehicle into the path of V1. V1 contacted the right rear of V2 as V2 crossed in front of V1, causing V2 to spin clockwise and come to final rest 22 meters (72 feet) southwest of impact on the west sidewalk facing northeast. V1's front struck the right rear of V2 a second time as V2 spun. V1 came to final rest in lane 135 meters (115 feet) south of the point of impact. After stabilization, the left rear of V1 was struck by an unknown hit-and run-vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 35-year-old female business owner who reported no injuries in the crash. She said she was on her way to work after dropping her roommate off at work. She advised that she was in lane 1, and a white truck was in lane 2 in front of her. She says she was traveling at 64 kmph (40 mph). She saw the white truck slam on its brakes and all of a sudden this car (V2) was in her lane. She was able to hit the brakes, but was unable to avoid the collision, due to V2 driving at a much slower speed. She claimed that she did not see V2 on the road prior to the crash. She thought he may have come from the opposite direction, crossed the median, and spun out in front of her. The Ford Explorer was towed due to disabling front end damage.
V2 was driven by a 23-year-old male who was transported from the scene with a back and head injury. He claimed to have been on his way to work, but was just about to run out of gas. He made a U-turn from the northbound lane into southbound lane 2, and claimed he checked his right side mirror before getting into lane 1. He didn't see any vehicles coming, so he changed lanes. He was then unexpectedly hit in the rear by another vehicle, spun around and came to final rest on the sidewalk. He claimed that V1 must have been in his blind spot.
This driver was able to provide the researcher a complete interview of pre-crash and crash events, but when questioned by police, family and doctors, the driver claimed he could not remember anything about the crash. The driver told the officer on-scene that he either fell asleep or blacked out. EMS workers reported the driver to be very sleepy and the brother reported him as acting very confused. Therefore, the information given to the researcher was questionable. It is possible that the driver's fatigue and medication use may have had reduced his mental functioning.
