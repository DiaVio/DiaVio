V2, a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling northbound in the right lane on a fully controlled, divided highway. The grassy median sloped downward and had a center metal guardrail. The two-lane, straight, level, bituminous roadway was wet at the time of the daylight (mid-morning) crash. A non-contact vehicle moved from lane two into the right lane in front of V2. V2 swerved into lane two to avoid contact with this non-contact vehicle.
V1, a 2001 Buick Century, was traveling northbound in lane two of the same roadway, and had no time for avoidance maneuvers. The left back of V2 struck the right front of V1. V2 spun counterclockwise and went off of the roadway on the left with the right side leading. V2 rocked up onto the right side wheels and continued to rotate until the back of V2 contacted the guardrail. The left front of V2 sustained damage from contact with the ditch. V2 rotated to the left and came to rest facing northwest near the guardrail. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 steered left at impact with V2 and lost control. V1 steered right and rotated clockwise and went off of the road to the left. V1 rotated back to the left and came to a stop facing north near the guardrail, past the final rest of V2. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was towed from the ditch and to a tow facility, but was drivable. No airbags deployed during the crash. Both drivers declined medical treatment.
