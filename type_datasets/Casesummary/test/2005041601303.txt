The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a four-lane interstate overpass with two paved emergency shoulders and concrete barriers on the west and east sides. The highway has a posted speed of 105 KMPH (65 MPH). Conditions were early evening on a weekday with dry roads and clear skies.
Vehicle #1, a 2001 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling south in the second lane of travel when a “phantom” vehicle (reported to be a red Dodge Ram) began to enter Vehicle #1's lane from the third lane of travel. This action of the phantom vehicle (which did not stop after supposedly cutting Vehicle #1 off) caused the driver of Vehicle #1 to lose control. The driver of Vehicle #1, a 21-year old male, reported that he slammed on his brakes and jerked the wheel to the right to avoid impact. These actions caused him to lose control and skid into the right concrete barrier. There was no evidence of contact between the phantom vehicle and Vehicle #1. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
