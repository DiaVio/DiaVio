The crash occurred in the eastbound lane one of a four-lane interstate. The interstate was dry with a 2 percent downhill slope and a slight left curve. The posted speed was 89 kmph on this dry bituminous well-traveled roadway. It was mid-afternoon on the weekend, the sky was cloudy and traffic was moderate.
V1, a 2007 four-door Honda Accord, was driven by a 17-year-old male traveling with his 45-year-old father. The driver stated that he was traveling east in lane one at a rate of about 64 kmph (40 mph). They had left their home 20 minutes prior to the accident going to the train station. A large box fell off a truck traveling in front of V1. Attempting to avoid a collision with the box in lane one, the driver of V1 slammed on the brakes. V2, a 2007 Nissan Pathfinder sport utility vehicle, was traveling in lane one about thirty feet behind V1. In an attempt to avoid colliding with V1, the driver braked unsuccessfully, striking the rear of V1 with the front of V2. Both vehicles came to rest on the right shoulder facing east. The driver of V1 was uninjured and the father was treated on the scene. No one was transported for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 was driven by a 39-year-old female traveling with her 12-year-old niece. The driver stated that she had left her mother's home twenty minutes prior to the crash on her way home. She was traveling east in lane one at a rate of 89 kmph (55 mph) when she saw the box and debris ahead in lane one. She reported that she applied her brakes at the same time as V1's brake lights came on; unfortunately, V2 struck the rear of V1.
A State Trooper traveling in lane four saw the box and debris in lane one but no truck. He stated that he noticed the box from the top of the hill and the box was already lying in the road. As he neared the area of the box he heard the skidding of tires and the collisions of V1 and V2.
