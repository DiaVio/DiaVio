The crash occurred in the intersection of a five-lane east/westbound roadway divided by a grassy median with crossovers and a two-lane north/southbound roadway. The east/westbound roadway had three westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes. The westbound lane one was marked as a right turn only lane. The right turn only lane curved right and merged with lane one of the northbound roadway. This roadway was dry, straight, level, asphalt with a posted speed limit of 72kph/45mph. The north/southbound roadway had one lane in each direction with a posted speed limit of 48kph/30mph. It was asphalt, dry, straight and level. At the intersection there were painted gores on the north/southbound lanes marking a single northbound lane from the crossover of the eastbound lanes, and a single right turn only lane from the southbound lanes to the westbound lane one. This portion of the roadway curved to the right and merged with westbound lane one, with a radius of curvature of 24m. There were no traffic control devices for either roadway.
V1, a 1998 Ford Taurus, four-door with one occupant was traveling westbound in lane two. V2, a 2002 Toyota Camry, four-door with one occupant was traveling from the southbound roadway in the curved section that merged into westbound lane one. V2 stopped in its lane as it negotiated the curve to the right. V1 braked and swerved to the right and its front end struck the left side of V2. After impact V1 continued traveling about two meters until it came to rest facing northwest against the west curb. V2 rotated in a counter-clockwise direction and came to rest against the west curb about three meters southwest of impact facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Ford Taurus, was driven by a 56-year old male who received non-incapacitating injuries and was transported to a hospital. The driver reported that he was running errands and traveling about 64kph/40mph. He said that three or four seconds before impact he saw V2 and thought it was southbound in the northbound lane about to turn left in front of him. He advised that he braked without lockup and steered to the right in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid striking V2.
V2, the Toyota Camry, was driven by a 21-year old female who was not injured. The driver reported that she was returning to work from an errand and stopped in the curved section of road from the southbound lane before trying to enter the westbound roadway. She said she stopped (3-4 seconds) and looked to her left for westbound traffic. She said she saw V1 suddenly swerve to its right directly towards her vehicle. She advised that she did not have time to take any avoidance actions before V1 struck her and spun her around.
