This crash occurred on an undivided 4-lane roadway, just prior to a controlled intersection. There were two westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes. This bituminous roadway was straight, level, and wet with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The crash occurred in the early morning on a weekday. There was an on-off light rainfall and the skies were dark. The roadway however, was still well lit. Traffic flow was congested with morning rush hour traffic and there was stop-and-go traffic activity.
V1, a 1992 Honda Accord 4-door with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V2, a 1999 Ford Contour 4-door with two occupants, was also traveling westbound in front of V1. As both vehicles approached the intersection, the light controlling the intersection changed from green to yellow. When V2 applied his brakes, the driver of V1 did as well. However, V1 did not slow down in time and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in lane one and close to the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 22-year-old male who reported no injuries. According to the statement given to the police, he was traveling westbound behind V2. He saw V2 brake lights activate when the light controlling the intersection changed to yellow from green. He slammed on his brakes, but due to the wet road conditions he was unable to successfully stop in time and struck the rear of V2. The driver of V1 refused both an interview and vehicle inspection.
V2, the 1999 Ford Contour, was driven by 30-year-old male who reported a complaint of pain and was transported to the hospital. His other occupant, his 4-year-old daughter, was transported to the hospital for observations. The driver was traveling westbound on the roadway and was slowing down for the yellow light ahead. The driver was struck in the rear by V1 as he was decelerating.
