This crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. This was a level roadway with a left hand curve and a posted speed limit of 56KMPH (35MPH). It was nighttime, snowing heavily, and the road edge had a buildup of snow and ice. The traveled portion of the roadway was slick and wet and ambient air temperature was below freezing. Traffic was extremely light.
V1, a 1986 GMC Â¾ ton 2wd longbed pickup truck, was traveling north. As V1 negotiated a curve the right side tires lost friction with the road and caused the vehicle to go into a counterclockwise yaw. The vehicle traveled across the southbound lane and impacted a telephone pole and a guardrail. As the vehicle continued to rotate the truck rolled two quarter turns coming to rest on its roof blocking both lanes of travel. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
V1 was driven by a 37 year old male who was transported to the hospital. There were no other occupants. The driver advised he was returning home from the bar when the crash occurred. He advised he didn't remember much from the crash but thought he saw a deer that might have startled him.
