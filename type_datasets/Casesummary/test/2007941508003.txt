This intersection-related crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, five-lane, undivided roadway. There were three northbound lanes, with a posted speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). This was a level, asphalt roadway that curved slightly to the left. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1988 Honda Civic CRX with one occupant, was northbound in lane one (right turn lane) approaching a red light. As the driver approached the intersection, she steered her vehicle off the road to the right. The vehicle traveled along a grass swale and a sidewalk as it continued to travel northbound. The front of V1 struck a large, steel traffic light pole, and came to final rest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 16-year old female, was transported for treatment of incapacitating injuries. She stated that she was on her way to work in the right lane as she approached the intersection. Up ahead there were one or two cars in her travel lane, waiting at the red light. According to the driver, she pressed down on the brake pedal, but the brakes did not respond. As she pressed harder, the vehicle began to shake. The driver said she had to steer to the right to avoid hitting traffic in front of her. In doing so, the driver steered into the path of the traffic light pole. Due to the intrusion of the lower instrument panel and toe pan on the driver's side, the brakes could not be tested to verify their condition.
