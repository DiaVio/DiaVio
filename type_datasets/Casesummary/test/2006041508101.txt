The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, seven-lane roadway, divided by a concrete curbed median. There were three northbound lanes and three southbound lanes with a left turn only on either side of the cross street. This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon, with wet roads and cloudy skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1990 Ford F-Series conventional straight truck with one occupant was traveling northbound in lane two. V2, a 2003 Jeep Wrangler with one occupant, was stopped ahead of V1 in the same lane. V3, a 2006 Dodge Charger with one occupant, was stopped in lane three, next to V2. V4, a 2004 Acura TL with one occupant, was stopped in lane three, in front of V3. V5, a 1990 Volvo 200 Series with one occupant, was stopped in front of V4. V6, a 2005 BMW X5 with one occupant, was stopped in front of V2. V1 failed to stop in time. The front of V1 made minor contact with the back left of V2. The left side of V1 then made contact with the entire right side of V3. V1 continued forward. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V4. The impact with V4 pushed V4 forward into V5. The right side of V1 then made contact with the left side of V6, before coming to final rest. All vehicles came to final rest at or near their points of impact. V1 and V6 were the only vehicles towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1 and 80 kmph for V2.
V1, the 1990 Ford, was driven by a 25-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he had just come from a job site, and was on his way to the courthouse for a court appearance. He indicated that he had previously been checking over some paperwork from the last job site, but insisted that he was paying attention to the roadway as he approached the intersection. The driver said that as he got closer to the stopped vehicles, he tried to apply the brakes, but they were not responding because of a transmission problem. This was later discounted, as there was no evidence of any brake deficiencies. He tried to steer left at the last second, in an effort to go in between V2 and V3. The result was a sideswiping of the two vehicles. The driver said that he began to pinball off of the other vehicles after that.
V2, the Jeep Wrangler, was driven by a 44-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from work. There was intermittent rain, and the ground was wet. The driver indicated that he was stopped for at least ten full seconds, when V1 came from behind at full speed; just grazing the back left side of his vehicle. He said there was no warning that the vehicle was coming, such as screeching tires or a honking horn.
V3, the Dodge Charger, was driven by a 42-year old male, who refused treatment. He said he was on his way back to work from lunch. His description of the crash events echoed the driver of V2. According to the driver, there was no warning prior to the crash, and it did not appear as though V1 slowed at all prior to the crash.
NOTE: The posted speed limit on the PAR is incorrect it is 72 kmph (45 mph) not 56 kmph (35 mph). This was verified by the researcher.
