The crash happened on a weekday during early afternoon hours. The location was a ten-lane divided (with two positive barriers) straight down hill highway. The weather was clear and the roads dry. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 89 kmph (55 mph). The eastbound lane is a HOV lane, separated from all other lanes by two moveable concrete barriers. At the time of the crash, the HOV lane was opened to the eastbound traffic. At the crash location the HOV lane was split into 2 lanes. The lane located north ran around a maintenance-building run by the HOV/highway authority. This was the continuing lane for the eastbound HOV traffic, using the south shoulder and parts of the blocked lane 4 of the westbound lanes of traffic. The southern leg of the divided eastbound lanes was the exit of the HOV lanes into the regular eastbound lanes. The concrete traffic barrier was interrupted at the location of V1's road departure. The open gap between the concrete barriers was marked with traffic cones. There was an iron gate in the gap of the eastern located traffic barrier, closing the entry from lane four of the westbound lanes.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Honda Civic with two occupants, was traveling east in the separated HOV lane of the roadway. The driver of V1 intended to use the continuing HOV lane. V1 drove off the roadway to the left. The front of the vehicle struck the Iron Gate, crossed four lanes of traffic and started to rotate counter clockwise. The vehicle impacted the north curb of the westbound lanes and departed the roadway to the north. V1 continued to move north crossing an entrance ramp to the westbound lanes and departing the highway to the north. The vehicle came to rest off the roadway, north of the highway. The left front wheel of the vehicle was separated during the crash event. A witness at the scene pointed out the separated wheel and told the researcher how he observed the fire department removing the wheel from the lane of the entry ramp. The vehicle was towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was treated at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
