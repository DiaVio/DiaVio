This three-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a five-lane roadway, between two separate road construction areas. This roadway is straight, level, consists of two lanes in each direction separated by a left-turn lane and the posted speed limit is 56 kph (35 mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. Traffic was congested due to the lunch hour rush.
Vehicle one, a 1997 Isuzu Rodeo, was stopped northbound in lane one with the intention of going straight. Vehicle two, a 2001 Toyota Camry, was stopped behind vehicle one, also intending to go straight. Vehicle three, a 1992 Saturn SL2, was northbound in lane one behind vehicles one and two. The front of vehicle three struck the back of vehicle two. Vehicle two was pushed forward and the front struck the back of vehicle one. All three vehicles came to rest in the original travel lane, facing north. Vehicles two and three were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
The driver of vehicle one, a twenty-six-year-old female, was commuting from home to work. She was well rested and comfortable with her vehicle as well as her route. She was taking Synthroid and an antibiotic; neither affected her driving.
The driver of vehicle two, a forty-one-year-old female, was driving from work to the grocery store. She was taking the afternoon off from work and was not in a hurry. She was familiar with both her vehicle and the roadway, was well rested at the time of the crash and is currently taking multi-vitamins and birth control pills.
The driver of vehicle three, a seventeen-year-old male, was driving with two of his friends (a nineteen-year-old male and a seventeen-year-old female) from their summer school class to one of their homes. He had two years of driving experience, was well rested and was comfortable with his vehicle. He was conversing with his friends regarding which CD they should listen to next and was looking at the right front seat passenger. He failed to realize that caution was required due to the heavy rush hour traffic and did not look far enough ahead. At the last minute, he looked forward and realized that traffic was stopped. He applied the brakes, but was unable to avoid a crash.
