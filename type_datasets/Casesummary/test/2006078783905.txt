A two-vehicle crash occurred during early morning daylight hours in the northbound lane of a two-lane roadway separated by a double yellow center line. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) with no traffic controls present. The road was dry and the sky was clear. There was no other traffic on the roadway.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Nissan Sentra 4 door with two occupants, was stopped on a gravel shoulder off the right edge of the paved roadway facing north. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Toyota Tundra extra-cab 4x2 pickup, was northbound in the number one lane behind V1. The driver of V2 saw V1 and continued northbound at about 56 kmph (35 mph). When V2 was about one car length from V1, the driver of V1 accelerated and attempted to make a U-turn across the path of V-2. The driver of V-2 attempted to brake, was unsuccessful, and struck the left side of V1 on the front fender. The impact caused V1 to rotate rapidly counterclockwise and a secondary impact occurred. The left rear corner of V1 struck the right rear wheel of V2. V1 came to a stop in an open dirt field facing generally northeast. V2 continued forward, swung slightly to the left of center, returned in a clockwise manner and came to a stop partially on the gravel shoulder facing generally northeast. The driver of V1 immediately exited his vehicle and ran on foot toward the V2 driver. The V1 driver stopped, yelled "back-off", pulled a firearm and discharged a single shot at the driver of V2. The shot missed, the V1 driver continued to flee into trees, and the V2 driver returned to his vehicle. Police later found and arrested the driver of V1, and returned him to the crash scene where he was interviewed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 5 kmph for V1 and 5 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 19 year-old male who advised during the interview that he must have blacked out and didn't remember the crash details. At first, he advised he thought he was stopped and had an accident. He then stated he had a female with him and he was taking her back into town. He thought he may have been making a U-turn but couldn't remember. He did recall that he went to sleep at 0200 hours the same day of the crash and got up at 0630 hours, about one half hour before the crash. A contributing factor for the driver of V1 tested positive for several different drugs: amphetamine, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana,
The driver of V2, a 26 year-old male, attempted to avoid the crash by braking but did not have enough time. Both vehicles were towed from the scene the driver of V1 was transported to a local medical facility.
