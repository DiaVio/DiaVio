This two-vehicle crash occurred during early morning rush hour in daylight in the westbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a grass median. There are two westbound and two eastbound lanes with shoulders and rumble strips on both sides. This is a straight, level bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). The road was dry and the sky was clear. Vehicle flow was congested with rush hour traffic and stop-and-go activity.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Plymouth Neon two door driven by a 20 year-old female was traveling westbound in the second lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Mercury Monterey minivan driven by a 35 year-old female, was westbound in the second lane in front of V1. Traffic in the westbound lanes was backing up from a stoplight-controlled intersection approximately 100 meters (328 feet) ahead. V2 began to decelerate, then came to a full stop. V1 was following closely, and impacted V2 in the rear with its front end. Both vehicles came to final rest in the second westbound lane. V1 was towed from the scene V2 left under own power. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
