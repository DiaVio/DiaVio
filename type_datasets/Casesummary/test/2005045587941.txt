The crash occurred on a barrier divided east/west interstate in an interchange area. Westbound where the crash took place there were three travel lanes with shoulders and barrier walls on the north and south sides. Traffic counts indicate that the six total interstate lanes carry 75,954 vehicles per day at the crash site with a posted speed of 89kmph (55mph). Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning.
Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Ford Taurus traveling westbound in the far left lane. Vehicle #2, a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier, was westbound in the third lane ahead of Vehicle #1. Apparently, the Taurus (V1) approached the Cavalier (V2) from behind at a high rate of speed and began following closely in an attempt to get the driver to move over and let him pass. In an effort to get Vehicle #1 to increase its following distance the driver of Vehicle #2 tapped his brakes. The Taurus (V1) changed lanes to the right and began to pass the Cavalier (V2). Because there was a slower moving non-contact vehicle in the center lane ahead, Vehicle #1 then tried to return to the far left in front of Vehicle #2. It appears that the Cavalier (V2) sped up as the Taurus (V1) was attempting change lanes to the left and the back left of Vehicle #1 contacted the right front of Vehicle #2. The collision caused Vehicle #1 to rotate counterclockwise and it struck the left inside concrete retaining wall with its left side. The Taurus (V1) came to rest on the north shoulder facing west. After impact the Cavalier (V2) pulled over to the north shoulder. Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage, and Vehicle #2 was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
