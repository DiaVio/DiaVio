This single-vehicle crash occurred approximately thirty-four meters west of a four-way, traffic signal-controlled intersection. On the south side of the intersection, the roadway is undivided and the northbound traffic lanes consist of a left-turn lane and a right-turn/through lane. On the west side of the intersection, the roadway is undivided and the westbound traffic lanes consist of a through lane and a brief merge lane. These roadways are straight and level, and have a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). This crash occurred in the late afternoon hours on a weekday with rush hour congestion.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Dodge Ram with three occupants was northbound in lane two, approaching the intersection. Traveling too fast, V1 made a left turn at the intersection and began traveling westbound in lanes one and two. The driver of V1 failed to straighten the steering wheel after the turn and crossed the double yellow line approximately 16 meters (52 feet)west of the intersection. The driver of V1 overcompensated by steering sharply back to the right and V1 crossed the westbound traffic lane (single through lane at this point). V1 departed the roadway on the right and impacted a tree with its front, coming to final rest at the point of impact, facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a fifteen-year-old female, was coming from a laundromat near her home and going to her school in order to become familiar with the route. She was well rested, but wasn't familiar with the vehicle since she had only driven it a few times before. This was her first time on the roadway and she had only been driving for two months; she had neither license nor permit to drive. The driver denied talking to her passengers, but the researcher overheard a conversation at the crash site and feels that she was talking to them about directions to the school. She told the paramedics she didn't have permission to take the truck to the school and the researcher believes that she was in a hurry to get it back before the side trip was discovered. She is in good health and takes no medications.
