This single-vehicle crash occurred on an entrance ramp at its entrance point onto an interstate bypass highway. The entrance ramp is undivided and consists of a single through lane. This ramp curves right, is uphill, and has an advisory speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) posted. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 105 kmph ( 65 mph). This crash occurred in the early morning daylight hours on a weekday with rush hour traffic congestion. There is no signage posted for the ramp traffic to yield to the interstate traffic.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Mazda 626 with one occupant, was traveling eastbound to eventually merge on the Interstate traveling southbound in lane one. A non-contact bus that was traveling southbound on the interstate bypass highway changed lanes to the right and entered lane one at the same time that V1 was entering the highway. The driver of V1 steered to the right to avoid a collision with the bus and departed the roadway on the right. V1 lost control in some shallow gravel on the right roadside and began rotating counterclockwise after the driver steered back to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision with a guardrail and re-enter the roadway. V1 impacted the guardrail with its right side and rotated counterclockwise, coming to final rest 4 meters (13 feet) south of the point of impact, facing southeast and resting against the guardrail with its right side. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a twenty-four-year-old male, was commuting from his home to work. He was unable to recall the time that he went to sleep the night before the crash, but stated he felt fine at the beginning of his trip. The driver is very comfortable with his vehicle, drives this route daily, is in good health, and takes no medications. Drivers entering and exiting the freeway at this location must use the same short section of interstate roadway either to: a) accelerate from an entrance ramp which is curved with a radius of 76 meters (249 feet); or, b) change lanes and decelerate to accommodate the same type of exit ramp. There is no signage posted for the ramp traffic to yield to the interstate traffic. There is also no curve warning signs or chevrons posted on the ramp. The investigating officer cited the driver of V1 for failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
