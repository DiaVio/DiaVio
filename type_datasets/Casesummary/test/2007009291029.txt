The crash occurred in an intersection of an east/west road and a north/south road. The northbound roadway had five lanes, including two left turn lanes and one right turn lane. The north/south roadway was divided by a raised curb median. The westbound roadway had four lanes, including one left turn lane and one right turn lane. The east/west roadway was divided by a grass median. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 89 kmph (55 mph). The north/south roadway had a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred mid-evening on a weekend. The road was dry, the sky was clear and this was a dark but lighted section of the roadway. This was a heavily traveled intersection and the traffic flow was moderate.
V1, a 2000 Hyundai Elantra four-door sedan with three occupants, was driven by a 23-year old male. V1 was traveling north in lane two when it entered the intersection, failing to obey a red traffic signal or yield the right of way. There was no evidence of avoidance maneuvers performed. An agent speaking for the driver stated that the vehicle did not belong to the driver and that the vehicle was lent to the driver while the owner was out of town. The PAR however, indicated that the driver and the owner were one and the same. All occupants of V1 were transported due to possible injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1988 Acura Legend two-door coupe, was driven by a 31-year old male, the sole occupant. V2 was traveling west in lane three, intending on going straight through the intersection. The driver of V2 had left a studio 2.5 miles east on his way home. When he entered the intersection he saw lights coming from his left, and he tried to avoid a crash by braking and steering to the right. Despite his actions, the front of V1 struck the left front and passenger section of V2. The impact caused V2 to veer forward 73 meters and right 23 meters, coming to rest off the road against a fence. V1 had traveled over six north and southbound traffic lanes, a median, a merge lane and a curb before traveling an additional 17 meters to its final rest. The driver was transported due to non-incapacitating injuries.
The driver of V1 provided false identification and insurance information to authorities. The driver neither spoke nor understood English and was supposedly not the owner of the car. He was possibly unfamiliar with its operation. Attempts to get further information failed, as the driver had left the area.
