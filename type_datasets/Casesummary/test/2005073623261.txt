This four vehicle crash occurred mid-afternoon during rush hour on a two lane, two way roadway in a construction zone. The roadway is fresh concrete, running east/west, bordered on the north edge with construction barrels, and on the south with an emergency berm. There is a stoplight controlled intersection farther to the east. Traffic was heavy and backed up in both directions from the intersection. The speed limit on the roadway is 72 kmph (45 mph), and the weather was dry, bright, and hot.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Ford F150 pickup truck driven by a 40 year-old male, was carrying a cargo of roadway rebar baskets weighing 862 kgs. (1900 lbs.). V1 was eastbound in the first lane, approaching the stoplight controlled intersection.

Vehicle four (V4), a 1993 Ford Crown Victoria driven by a 17 year-old female with one passenger, was eastbound in front of V3. As eastbound traffic came to a stop due to the controlled intersection, V1's front impacted with the rear of V2. V2 was pushed forward and struck the right rear of V3 with the front end.
