The crash occurred in an intersection controlled by an on colors traffic signal, in the afternoon on a clear, dry weekday. V1, a 1992 Chevrolet Lumina, was southbound on a two-way, four-lane, straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56kmh (35mph). V1 was traveling in the left lane approaching three non-contact vehicles stopped to make a left turn at the intersecting road. V1 changed lanes to the right curb lane and proceeded through the intersection although the signal was amber prior to v1 entering the intersection.
V2, a 1994 Saturn SL, was northbound on the same road and had stopped on the green light at the intersection for 3-5 seconds, waiting to turn left. V2, driven by 24 year-old female, accelerated from the stop and proceeded to turn left. The front of v1, driven by a 47 year-old female, struck the right side of V2 in the intersection. Neither driver had time for avoidance actions. V1 came to rest facing south in the southbound curb lane at the southwest corner. V2 came to final rest facing northeast in the eastbound curb lane just west of the intersection. V1 was driven from the scene. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. Both fully restrained drivers were transported from the scene to a local trauma center where they were treated and released. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
