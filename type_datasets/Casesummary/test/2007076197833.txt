This two-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a 2-lane asphalt roadway. The northbound lane curves left and is downhill. The speed limit is 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred just past noon during daylight hours with no adverse weather or road conditions present.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Jeep Wrangler with an 5.4 meter (18 foot) long flatbed trailer in tow loaded with several crates of ceramic tile, driven by a fifty (50) year old male was northbound negotiating a left curve when the trailer began to fishtail (e.g., trailer swing). The driver steered left and right and applied brakes. V1 crossed from the northbound lane to the left into the southbound lane and with the left front bumper contacted the left front bumper of Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Toyota Avalon 4-door sedan. V2 was driven by a fifty seven (57) year old male with one passenger. V2 was pushed back into a dirt embankment which caused damage to its right side. Both vehicles came to rest in the area of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1 was traveling home after purchasing flooring supplies at a store 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) away. He stated he wasn't sure at the start of his trip if the load was too heavy for his vehicle. He soon discovered it was too heavy of a load and the trailer began to swing back & forth. The driver was unable to control the vehicle and traveled into the oncoming travel lane.
