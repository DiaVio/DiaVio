This single vehicle rollover crash occurred at night in the median of a 6-lane divided highway. The level, straight roadway runs north and south with 3-lanes for each direction. The weather is clear, dry and it was dark without lighting. The speed limit on the highway is 105 kmph (65 mph) and the traffic level is minimal.
V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, was traveling south in lane 1 at an estimated speed of 137kmph (85 mph) when it attempted to change lanes when its driver noticed a car in lane 2. The driver of V1 than tried to re-enter lane one and than V1 lost control of the vehicle as it spun counterclockwise off the left side of the roadway and into a grass median. Once the car entered the median, it traveled almost 35 meters before it rolled over several times and came to rest in the median. Police Reported Travel Speed is 137 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 19-year-old male in good health who was not wearing his prescribed lenses that correct a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition. He and his three other friends went to a restaurant tonight to celebrate his birthday (the college they attend is 50 miles from the restaurant they ate at). While driving home on the highway in lane one, this driver reports there was a car in front of him driving slow and he wanted to pass it on the left side. He admits he was probably driving too fast to make the maneuver and that is why he lost control of his car. He said after he decided to merge into lane 2, he noticed a car directly behind him, and he feared he would either cut that vehicle off or cause a rear-end collision and that's when he overcorrected his steering. He tried to return to his original lane but he could not regain control of his vehicle. He spun counterclockwise and departed the road on the left side where he rolled his car in the grass median. EMS arrived and examined all the occupants but nobody was transported for injuries.
