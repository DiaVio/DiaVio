Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Chevrolet Cavalier 4dr with one occupant, was traveling northbound approaching the intersection and stopped for the traffic control device for about 1-2 seconds before accelerating through the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford F-150 4X4 pickup with one occupant, was traveling westbound with the cruise control set at 80 KPH (50 MPH). V1 entered the intersection after the driver apparently looked to the right. V2 entered the intersection. The driver of V2 steered to the right to avoid the crash. The left side of V2 struck the front right corner of V1. V1 came to a stop in the intersection facing north. The impact caused V2 to rotate counter clockwise. The vehicle traveled across the east/west roadway in a southwesterly direction until it traveled off the south edge of the roadway. The vehicle then traveled up a small embankment and landed in a ditch after the rear trailer hitch struck the south ditch bank. The vehicle came to rest with the rear in the ditch facing in a northeasterly direction. V1 was towed from the scene while V2 was driven. Neither driver was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
