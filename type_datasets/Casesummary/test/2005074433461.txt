The impact with the fence caused V1 to rollover towards its left side down the embankment, and onto its top before coming to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 was initially talking on her cell phone at the time of the incident. The driver was holding cell phone in her left hand and possibly holding a cigarette in her right hand while also holding the steering wheel. The driver stated that she usually smokes while returning home from work. She was cited for careless driving as a result of the above actions while driving. According to the driver's sister, who was talking to the driver on cell phone, the driver was telling her she felt somewhat depressed and lonely due to recent breakup with her boyfriend and not having co-workers to socialize with. Also, the driver completed her third 10-hour shift and was returning home feeling hungry and tired. Although this driver was experiencing hunger and fatigue, she typically ate after returning home and stays up an additional 4 hours before going to sleep. The driver is a diagnosed epileptic and takes required medication twice a day for this condition. Ultimately, the cause of the driver losing control of V1 is attributed to driver experiencing an epileptic seizure. This was the conclusion as reported on the driver's medical reports.
