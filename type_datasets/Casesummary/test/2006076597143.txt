This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, two way, undivided, asphalt roadway. This roadway runs east to west and has various curves and grades with guardrails on both sides. Two solid yellow lines, indicating a no passing zone, mark the centerline of the roadway. Both vehicles were traveling in a curved section of the roadway that curves to the south where the radius of curvature is 450 meters (1476 feet) and a super elevation of 5% down toward the center of the radius. The roadway slopes up to the west. This crash occurred during the late morning hours with a light rain and good visibility. The posted speed is 89 kmph (55 mph) with an advisory speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) in the curve.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet Astro mini van with one occupant, was eastbound on a downgrade negotiating the curve. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Class A motor home, with three occupants was westbound in the same curve. V1 crossed the centerline of the roadway and the front left corner of V1 struck the left side of V2. At impact V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the eastbound travel lane heading in a southerly direction. After impact, V2 came to a controlled stop off the roadway on the right roadside past the guardrail. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
A 37 year-old male drove V1. He stated that he looked down inside his vehicle trying to read an address and when he looked up he was about to impact the motor home. He stated that he tried to swerve right to avoid the impact but the wet road made him slide into the motor home. He claims to be in good health but does use a daily medication for a lower back pain condition. He slept last at his residence and got 8 and half hours of sleep. He felt rested when he started this trip and had been on the road for about 2 hours. He stated that it was raining just before the crash and thought the wet road may have contributed to this crash. Data downloaded from the vehicle indicated that the driver did not attempt any braking action pre-crash and the vehicle was traveling approximately 72-81 kmph (45-50 mph) prior to impact.
A 51 year- old male drove V2. He saw V1 cross the centerline of the roadway and tried to steer right. He stated that he and his parents (the two passengers) were just touring the country and had been on the road this day for about one hour. He refused to give any personal information about himself or his parents. He felt this interview was too personal.
