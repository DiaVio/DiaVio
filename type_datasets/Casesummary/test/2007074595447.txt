This single-vehicle crash occurred near a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. The east/west trafficway is level and divided by a curbed median. The eastbound approach curves to the right and consists of two through lanes and a left turn lane. The speed limit for this trafficway is 64 kmph (40 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Toyota Camry, was eastbound in lane one. The driver of V1 abruptly steered right and V1 traveled across the intersecting roadway, rotating clockwise. V1 traveled off the edge of the roadway and the front struck a fire hydrant. V1 then rolled over to the left four quarter-turns and was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a twenty-five-year-old female, had just left home and was on her way to a friend's house. She was healthy, well rested and familiar with her vehicle. She travels this route daily. This driver stated that she was thinking about the friend she was going to visit, that she "just was not paying attention." When she realized that the traffic signal was red and another vehicle was traveling northbound into the intersection, she immediately steered to the right.
