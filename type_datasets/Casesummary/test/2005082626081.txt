This single vehicle collision occurred around noon on a four lane northbound divided interstate with a posted speed limit of 97 kmph (60 mph). Lanes three and four are exit lanes divided by a traffic attenuator and guardrail. Lanes one and two are through lanes. It was raining at the time of the crash. The concrete roadway was wet, free of congestion/sight restrictions, and road deficiencies at the time of the collision. The roadway has a minimal positive grade and slight curvature to the right.
Vehicle one (V1), a Chrysler Lebaron convertible driven by a 21 year-old male, was traveling northbound in lane four, the exit lane for the Express lanes. He traveled into the gore point between lanes three and four and collided with the traffic attenuator separating the exit lanes. The front of V1 hit the attenuator. V1 rotated counterclockwise and rolled ¼ turn onto its right side. V1 then rolled another ¼ turn onto its roof and slid approximately 15 meters (49 feet) before coming to final rest on its roof facing south in the lane three-exit lane. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
