The crash occurred on a north/south, four lane, undivided US Hwy along a portion of road that has a wide curve to the right (if traveling southbound). The measured radius of the curve was 468.75 meters. The four lanes were split down the middle by a wide double yellow line. The posted speed limit was 80 KPH/50 MPH. Conditions were daylight and dry in the late morning on a weekday.
Vehicle 1 was a 1997 Chevrolet S10 pickup traveling southbound in the left lane on the highway when it crossed the double yellow line into the first northbound lane near the apex of the curve. Vehicle 1 struck Vehicle 2 head-on in an offset left frontal-type crash. Vehicle 2, a 1997 Nissan Sentra GXE, was traveling northbound in the first lane on the highway. After impact, Vehicle 1 rotated counter-clockwise. As it rotated, its wheels tripped on the pavement and it rolled four quarter turns and came to rest upright facing northeast in the right northbound lane of travel approximately 25 meters south of POI. Vehicle 2 was knocked back and to its right, traveling down an embankment off the right shoulder. It struck a sign and came to rest facing southwest, approximately 18 meters south of impact and situated three or four meters from the right side of the road. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.
