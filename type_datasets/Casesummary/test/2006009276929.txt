This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday at the intersection between a five-lane roadway and a driveway to a convenience store. The north/south roadway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a two-way center turn lane. The bituminous roadway was dry and level with a curve to the left (in the northbound direction) and a posted speed limit of a 72 kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2000 Ford F-150 with one occupant, was exiting out of a convenience store parking lot, intending to turn left into the southbound lanes. V2, a 1991 Mazda Pick-up with one occupant, was northbound in lane two negotiating the curve in the roadway. V1 pulled out of the driveway to begin its turn without yielding to V2. The front of V2 struck V1 on its front left side. Both vehicles came to a rest in the southbound lanes of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V2, a 36-year-old male, was transported due to incapacitating injuries. The vehicle did not have airbags and the driver was not wearing his seatbelt. The driver stated that he was on his way home negotiating the curve at a constant velocity. He said that he saw V1 sitting in the driveway to store when all of the sudden it just pulled out.
