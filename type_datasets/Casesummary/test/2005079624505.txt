Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Honda Civic four-door, driven by a 18 year-old female with one passenger was traveling southbound in the first lane of opposing traffic, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V 1 made its turn, the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2 rotated counter-clockwise from impact and came to rest in the first southbound lane, facing north. V1 came to rest in the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

At the time of the crash, she was still recovering from a flu-like illness, which had lasted a week.
