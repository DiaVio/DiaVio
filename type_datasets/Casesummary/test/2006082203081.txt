The speed limit on this roadway is 48 kph (30 mph). At the time of this crash, the roadway surface is asphalt was dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one, a 1998 Chevrolet Blazer, was northbound in lane three and moved in to the turn lane, intending to turn left at the intersection. Vehicle two, a 1998 GMC Jimmy, was stopped southbound, intending to go straight through the intersection. The traffic signal turned solid green for vehicle two and the driver accelerated into the intersection after waiting for the oncoming, left-turning vehicles to clear the intersection. Vehicle one turned left at the intersection (with a red arrow) and the front of vehicle one struck the front of vehicle two. Vehicle one rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the intersection facing west. Vehicle two rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest in the intersection facing southwest. The driver of vehicle one, a twenty-five-year-old male, refused to be interviewed. He was arrested on scene with a blood alcohol content result of 0.12 and in possession of an unknown illicit drug. There were two passengers in vehicle one, a thirteen-year-old male and a twenty-six-year-old male. The driver of vehicle two, a twenty-six-year-old male, had just left a restaurant and was on his way to a golf course. He was well rested and very familiar with his vehicle and the roadway. He was not in a hurry and was aware of the necessary caution required at this intersection. He did apply the brakes when he realized that vehicle one was not going to stop at the red arrow, but was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Both vehicles were towed from the scene.
