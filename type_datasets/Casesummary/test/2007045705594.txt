The crash occurred on a primary arterial, two-way, five-lane road that ran east/west and was straight and level in the area of the crash. The center lane was a two-way left turn only-lane. The road was bordered on both north and south sides by private driveways. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry at midday on a weekday with a speed limit of 72kph/45mph for either direction of travel.
V1 was a 2003 Ford Taurus station wagon that was traveling east on the arterial road in lane 2. A Noncontact Vehicle (NC) that had been traveling in lane 1 eastbound adjacent to V1 changed lanes to its (NC's) left and V1 avoided a collision by changing lanes to lane 3. The driver of V1 then honked her horn at the NC vehicles driver and shook her fist. D1 also claimed that the driver of the NC vehicle “flipped her the bird” further angering her. V1 then began to skid longitudinally as the brakes were applied in an attempt to avoid a head on collision with V2. V2 was a 2001 Ford Explorer that was stopped in lane 3 but facing west waiting for traffic to clear so it could turn left/south into a private driveway. V1's front struck V2's front. Both vehicles came to rest within ½ meter of impact and were facing their original travel directions. V1 was towed from the scene and V2 was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a seventy-seven-year-old-belted-female whose airbags deployed and was uninjured in the crash. She related to the researcher that she had been on her way from home to bring her ailing son his prescription medication while he was in jail. She described the above events and was still angry that the other (NC) driver had left after the crash.
V2 was driven by a thirty-year-old-belted-female whose airbags did not deploy and who was also uninjured in the crash. She had been stopped for several seconds at the time of the crash waiting for a sufficient traffic gap so she could turn left. She was on her way back to work from lunch.
