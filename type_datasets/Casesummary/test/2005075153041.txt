This single vehicle crash occurred early evening hours on a bituminous, two-lane, undivided mountain road. The road runs north and south at the crash location. The speed limit is 48 kmph (30 mph) and there were no traffic control devices in the area. It was dark with patches of ice present and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Explorer, was traveling south in lane one and had just exited a right hand curve when it traveled off the right side of the road onto the snow packed dirt shoulder. The vehicle continued forward and started down a steep embankment where the front of the vehicle struck a tree. The vehicle then slid laterally to the right down the embankment when the right side passenger compartment struck another tree where the vehicle came to rest facing south. The vehicle was towed from the scene and the driver was not injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 was a 71-year-old female who was returning to her residence after deplaning from an overseas flight. She drives the route daily and is familiar with the vehicle. She was fatigued from the irregularity of her sleep pattern on the trip and did a lot of physical activities while there. The driver failed to adjust the directional control of the vehicle as it exited the curve, ran off the right side of the road and struck a tree.
