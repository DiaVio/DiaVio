The crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The east/west roadway was a two-way, eight-lane street divided by a very wide grass median. The north/south roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street controlled by a stop sign. Posted speeds for east/west traffic were 64 kmph (40 mph) and 48 kmph (30 mph) for north/south traffic. These were straight, level, asphalt roads. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2006 Chevy Monte Carlo with two occupants, was traveling northbound in lane one. V2, a 1996 Honda Accord with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane three. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. After stopping for a period of time at the stop sign, V1 proceeded into the intersection. As the two vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
V1, the Monte Carlo, was driven by a 17-year old female, who was transported to the hospital with injuries. She stated that she had just picked up a friend and was heading toward the interstate. She stopped at the stop sign, told her passenger to put on his seatbelt, and was waiting for eastbound traffic to clear so that she could cross to the median area. The driver indicated that as she waited for a break in traffic, she could see a vehicle in the median area, facing opposite her direction, apparently waiting to cross traffic in the same manner that she was. She assumed that the lack of a turn signal indicated that the driver opposite of her intended to go straight, as she did. When there was a break in the traffic, the driver of V1 said she began to cross the eastbound lanes, but was cut off by the phantom vehicle that made a left turn in front of her. To avoid hitting the phantom vehicle, the driver slowed to almost a complete stop in the middle of the eastbound lanes. As she began to accelerate again, she was struck in the left side by V2.
An independent witness, who was traveling in an adjacent lane to the right of V2, confirmed the driver's account of the crash. The witness stated that V1 started across the intersection. Then, for reasons unknown to the witness, the driver of V1 hesitated in the intersection before accelerating out of the witness's travel lane, into the path of V2.
V2, a 1996 Honda Accord, was driven by a 30-year old female, who was transported to the hospital with injuries. She stated that she was on her way to work when she saw V1 ahead of her, stopped at the stop sign. The driver of V2 believed that the driver of V1 was attempting to beat her to get to the other side. She said that all she could do was hit the brakes, but there was not enough time to stop.
