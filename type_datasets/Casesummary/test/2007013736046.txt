This crash occurred off the left side of an undivided straight two-lane asphalt roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred during the early afternoon hours and there were no adverse conditions present at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2002 GMC Envoy utility vehicle, was traveling northbound. V1 departed the roadway to the right, and then returned to the roadway while skidding counterclockwise. V1 then departed its lane to the left, and crossed over the oncoming lane toward the left shoulder. The driver then overcorrected to the right and the vehicle began a clockwise rotation as it departed the roadway to the left. V1 then began to roll over to the left, rolling 2-quarter turns before skidding several feet on its top to final rest, facing east on the roadside. The driver of V1 was transported to the hospital due to possible injuries. V1 was towed from the scene due to moderate damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 37-year-old female, stated she was on her way home from the grocery store when she noticed a cone in the road at the last second. She stated she swerved to the right to avoid the cone, drove off the shoulder to the right, overcompensated and swerved back to the roadway through the right lane into the left lane and off the roadway to the left. She stated she was headed right for a tree so she swerved again to the right, overcompensated, and that is when her vehicle began to roll.
