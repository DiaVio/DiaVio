This two-vehicle crash occurred near a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. The north/south roadway is undivided, straight, level and consists of two lanes in each direction. The speed limit for this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Mercury Sable, was northbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Dodge Intrepid, was southbound in lane one. V1 stopped behind a non-contact vehicle (NCV1) that was waiting to turn left in the intersection. When the NCV1 turned, V1 began to travel northbound. Another non-contact vehicle (NCV2) was in front of V1 and the driver of V1 steered left to avoid this NCV. V1 traveled over the center line and the front struck the front of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.

This driver has COPD and high blood pressure and takes the medications Metoprolol Tartrate, Triamterene/HCTZ, Avapro, Combivent, Advair and Lipitor. This driver stated that she did not see the NCV2 until the NCV1 turned. She steered left abruptly to avoid the NCV2.
