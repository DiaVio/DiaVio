The crash occurred on a north/south two-lane residential roadway with one lane in each direction. The asphalt roadway was dry and straight with a positive 4 percent slope to the north. The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred on a weekend morning before sunrise. There were no streetlights. Traffic was very light.
V1, a 1995 Chevy S10 pickup, had one occupant and was northbound in lane one. V1 drove across the centerline to the left and off the left edge of the roadway. The vehicle continued in a straight path for about 28m across a driveway and stretch of grassy roadside until it struck two small trees on the south side bank of ditch stretching to the west. V1 then jumped the ditch, striking the north side bank with the undercarriage, loosening the gas tank. V1 then continued traveling another 42m in a straight path parallel to the roadway on a stretch of dewy grass roadside. To the west of the roadside there was a dense expanse of trees of various sizes. V1's gas tank fell off about 70m after departing the roadway. V1 then veered to the left, going down an embankment with a downward slope of 67 percent to a level area covered with trees. Along the way down the embankment to final rest, V1 struck trees with its front end, on the right side of the passenger area, and on the back end while spinning in a counterclockwise rotation. V1 came to rest facing southeast approximately 75m north of the point it departed the roadway and approximately 15m west of the roadway and about 4m below the roadway level. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a 45-year old male who received possible injuries and was transported to a hospital. He said he did not know what happened when questioned by the researcher but told police he was going too fast and went off the road. The driver was under the influence of alcohol, cocaine and marijuana and could not answer most of the questions when interviewed.
