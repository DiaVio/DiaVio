This crash occurred in the eastbound lanes (two lanes head east and one heads west) of a three lane undivided, straight roadway in an urban-like setting where the posted speed limit is 48kmph (30mph). The roadway was dry and the weather was clear. This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon.
V1, a 1991 Chrysler New Yorker, was traveling east when it stopped in lane two (the left turn lane) awaiting traffic to pass before turning into a fast food restaurant. V2, a 1990 Nissan Pick-up, truck was leaving a service station on the east side of the road. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 was “waived” out of the lot by the driver of an uninvolved vehicle stopped in lane one of the roadway. As V2 proceeded out of the lot it was struck by the front left of V1. The driver and a passenger of V1 were transported to an area hospital, treated and released. Another passenger in V1 was not injured. The driver of V2 was not injured.
V1 was driven by a belted 58 year-old female who claimed to be in good health despite a history of diabetes, which is treated by medication. She was wearing her prescription lenses that correct a myopic (near-sighted) condition. The driver of V1 stated she had seen the truck coming at her but had no place to go. She, therefore, put her hands over her face and closed her eyes, having already had her foot on the brake pedal. The airbag of this vehicle deployed and the vehicle was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a belted 26 year-old male in good health and traveling home after running a few errands. This driver stated he was looking first at the driver who 'waived' him out and then looked to his right for on-coming traffic. He stated he did not see V1 until “that car hit me”. This vehicle was not towed, however, it was pushed back into the parking lot when its battery went dead.
