This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekend. The crash occurred on a straight stretch of a three-lane, two-way, north-south, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. A two-way left turn lane separates northbound and southbound traffic, and the speed limit is 40 kmph (25 mph) in both directions. A parking lane borders the outside lane of each travel direction, and business parking lots are along both roadsides. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford E350 van, was traveling southbound in the left turn lane, about to turn left into a private drive. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford Focus four-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the first lane, approaching V1's position. As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles rotated clockwise and came to rest in the northbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
