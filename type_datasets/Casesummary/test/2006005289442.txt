This one-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a two-way, three-lane roadway, which was not physically divided. There was one eastbound lane and one westbound lane and a middle common turning lane. The bituminous roadway was straight with a slight downhill grade. The posted speed limit was 64kmph (40mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and the roadway was dry.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Hummer H2, was heading west on the roadway intending to go straight in the first lane of travel. He swerved over into the center turning lane and then returned to the westbound lane and stopped for a few seconds at the entrance to the shopping center. He then proceeded westbound swerving violently from the center lane into the eastbound lane. He went through the intersection in the eastbound lane almost striking two vehicles which had stopped in the east and right turn lane for eastbound traffic. He stayed in the eastbound lane and went through the intersection before violently swerving off the right side of the road, crossing two lanes, and striking a utility pole. The impact caused the right front wheel to separate from the vehicle. Vehicle one continued forward slightly and came to final rest partially off of the roadway facing west. This vehicle was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.

This driver refused to answer any questions concerning what happened. The investigating officer was following this vehicle and witnessed the events unfold. He relayed that the driver had suffered from a diabetic emergency, which rendered him incapable of driving the vehicle.
