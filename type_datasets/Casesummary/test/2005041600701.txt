There were five northbound lanes: lane one was a right turn only, lane two, three, and four were straight only, and lane five was left turn only. There were no traffic lights controlling the roadway. Intersecting this roadway on the east side was a shopping plaza parking lot with a lane to pull into and a lane to exit. Conditions were dry on an afternoon on a weekend. The traffic flow was normal and the roadway was straight and level. The posted speed limit was 72 KMPH (45 MPH).
Vehicle #1 was a 1996 Hyundai Accent driven by a 29-year old male who was stopped at the exit of the plaza waiting to pull out into traffic to make a left hand turn. He looked both ways but did not see the Vehicle #2, a 2000 Dodge Caravan. The Dodge Caravan was traveling northbound in lane two going approximately 56 KMPH (35 MPH). Vehicle #1 pulled out onto the northbound roadway and was struck in the left side driver's door by the front of Vehicle #2.
