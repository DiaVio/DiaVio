She estimated that she was stopped 1-2 seconds before proceeding, and was traveling approximately 16 kmph (10 mph) at impact. She accelerated but was unable to avoid the crash. The sport utility was not towed due to police-reported damage.

Another vehicle pulled across the road in front of him, and he braked in avoidance. He estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 64 kmph (40 mph). The compact pickup was towed due to damage.
