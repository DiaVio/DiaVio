V1, a 2000 Ford Windstar occupied by a 43-year-old driver and a 12-year-old male passenger, was northbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above approaching a controlled intersection. V2, a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder occupied by a 21 year old driver and a 21 year old female passenger, was also northbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above stopped at the intersection. V1, front, contacted V2, back. The passenger of V1 was transported due to injuries sustained in the crash. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven away from the scene. Complete driver interviews and vehicle inspections were obtained for both vehicles. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 stated that she was in lane 2 because she needed to turn left onto a street to get to her office. She had just picked up her son from a violin lesson and was going to stop buy her office as she had called in sick that day. She was approaching her destination from a different direction than normal and was not familiar with where to turn. She only knew that it was onto a street at a controlled intersection. She took her eyes off the road to look for a street sign and when she looked back towards the front she saw V2 stopped in front of her. She tried to brake but did not have time to stop before impacting the rear of V2.
The driver of v2 stated that she and the passenger had just done some shopping at a nearby store and was on their way home. They were stopped at the red light for a few seconds when they were suddenly rear ended by V1. The driver of V2 stated that she never saw v1 coming and was unable to take any avoidance actions.
