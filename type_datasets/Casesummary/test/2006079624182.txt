This crash occurred at a highway interchange, around the entrance ramp to an expressway. At the time of the crash (a Sunday afternoon), it was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions or roadway defects. The speed limit for the roadway is 105 kmph (65 mph). The entrance ramp is a one-way, two-lane, uphill roadway, which curves right. The ramp merges with a two-lane expressway, forming a four-lane expressway.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan 350Z two-door hatchback, was traveling southbound in the second lane of the entrance ramp. At the point where the ramp merges with the freeway, a non-contact vehicle merged from the first lane into the second lane ahead of V1 and decelerated. V1 veered left to avoid the non-contact vehicle and lost traction. V1 rotated clockwise and crossed the expressway lanes, departing the road to the left side. On the left roadside, the left side of V1 impacted a tree, bringing V1 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1.
