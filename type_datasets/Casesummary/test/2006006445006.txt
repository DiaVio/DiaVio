This two-vehicle crash took place on a clear, early weekday afternoon in a 4-way intersection. This intersection was the meeting place for a street that ran north and south, and another street that ran east and west. Each street had a posted speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph) and the asphalt surfaces were dry and free of any defects. Traffic lights controlled the movement in this intersection and they were all functioning properly. The intersecting streets each had one lane for travel in either direction, and a shoulder lane on either side that was used for residential parking. The street that ran east and west had an additional travel lane on either side of the street that was designated for bicycle travel. These "bike lanes" were situated between the shoulder lane and the travel lane.
Vehicle 1 (V1 - designated as V2 in the PAR), a 2005 Hyundai Accent driven by a 23-year old female, was traveling east in lane one. As V1 entered the intersection, the front of her vehicle struck the left side front area of Vehicle 2 (V2 - designated V1 in the PAR). V1 then continued through the intersection and at final rest, the rear of V1 was sitting in the intersection and its front was sitting in a crosswalk. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
V2, a 1994 Chevrolet Lumina driven by a 31-year-old female with a suspended license, was traveling northbound in lane one. According to a witness who was very familiar with this intersection, V2 was accelerating into the intersection in an attempt to make a right turn on red when V1, "... smashed right into the other car." (verbatim) The witness stated that he has seen and heard many crashes at this intersection and stated that he had long felt that there should be "No Turn on Red" traffic signs posted at this intersection. He stated that the first thing that the driver's did when they exited their vehicles was to begin arguing about the crash. He also stated that the driver of V2 was yelling at the driver of V1 for being on a cell phone while driving. The witness could not confirm this, but did say that he was certain that the driver of V2 was not on a cell phone. It remains unknown whether or not the driver of V2 was using a cell phone. After being struck by V1, V2 was pushed in a southeastwardly direction and came to its final rest in the shoulder lane of the east/westbound street. (The street that it was attempting to make a right onto.)
Emergency medical services were dispatched to the scene and both the driver and 18-year-old female passenger were transported directly to an emergency room with injuries of unknown severity. The driver of V2 stated that she had chest pains. The occupant of V2 stated that she had pain in her right wrist, knees, and legs. The driver of V2 claimed not to be injured, as did her two passengers, a 26-year-old male and an 8-year-old female
