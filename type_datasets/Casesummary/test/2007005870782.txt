This three-vehicle crash occurred on a weekday during daylight hours on an undivided two-lane roadway. The bituminous roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The road was wet from a previous rain. There was no traffic control device associated with this particular stretch of roadway. Traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1989 Plymouth Voyager minivan, was heading south on the roadway, intending to continue straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Subaru Impreza 4-door sedan, was heading north on the roadway intending to continue straight. Vehicle three (V3), a 2006 BMW 3-series 4-door sedan was also heading north on the roadway behind V2 intending to continue straight. Vehicle one crossed over the center yellow lines and the front left of V1 clipped the left front side V2. The impact broke the left front axle of V1 and caused V2 to lose control as it exited the roadway to the right and spun counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees. While still out of control, V2's right rear side struck a tree where it came to final rest off the right side of the roadway facing west. Vehicle one continued in the opposing lane and was headed uncontrollably directly at V3. To avoid the crash, V3 veered to the right as it exited the roadway and struck a utility pole upon which it came to final rest. Vehicle one continued on for approximately 75 meters before it came to final rest on the right side of the roadway. All three vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 44 year-old female, suffered possible injuries and was transported to the hospital for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle. She claimed that she was heading home from work and that a cat darted out in front of her vehicle. She swerved to the left and that is when she clipped the left side of V2. She stated that she did not remember being treated on-scene and that she only remembered waking up in the hospital. The driver relayed that while she only receives 3 hours of sleep per day and works 60 hours a week, she was not fatigued at the time of the crash. Her only medical condition was asthma; however, she claimed that it has not affected her ability to drive in the past. She was very familiar with the roadway, and no mechanical problems contributed to this crash.
The driver of V2, a 31 year-old male, was not injured and did not require any medical attention. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of this vehicle. For this reason it is uncertain if any fatigue or health related factors contributed to the crash.
The driver of V3, a 55 year-old male, was not injured as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle. He claimed that he was driving along behind V2 when the vehicle coming in the opposite direction (V1) crossed the lane line and clipped the vehicle in front of him. As V1 continued towards him, all he could do was swerve to the right. Upon doing so he left the roadway and struck a utility pole. The driver stated that he was in excellent health, although he did suffer from a minor case of sleep apnea but was not fatigued at the time of the crash. He was very familiar with the roadway and no mechanical problems contributed to this crash.
There was no Critical Pre-crash Event coded to this vehicle because it was not involved in the first harmful event. For this reason, no Critical Reason could be coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to the driver were sleep apnea and the wet roadway.
