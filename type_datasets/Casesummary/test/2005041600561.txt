Vehicle # 1 was a 1994 Honda Civic, who was traveling eastbound in lane four, the left turn lane. There were no traffic control devices controlling this part of the intersection. He was stopped waiting to turn left and saw vehicle # 2, a 1995 Toyota corolla, which was traveling in lane two going westbound at approximately 45 mph. The Toyota was traveling straight, intending to continue through the intersection. The Honda civic driver saw the Toyota and since she started beeping her horn when he started to turn, the driver of the Honda thought she was signaling him to make his left hand turn.
