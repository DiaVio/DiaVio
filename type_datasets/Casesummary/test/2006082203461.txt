A two vehicle daytime collision occurred at an intersecting driveway from a two-way city street. The city street runs north/south and has two lanes in each direction with a left hand turn lane for northbound traffic. The driveway is located on the east side of the street and is located approximately 27 meters (90 feet) south on an intersecting street where traffic is controlled by traffic control signals. At the time of the crash, traffic in northbound lane two was stopped for the signals. The roadway is straight and level and paved with asphalt. The speed limit is 48 kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash the sky clear and there were no adverse conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Mazda Protege sedan with one passenger, was traveling south on the roadway in lane two. The driver stopped in lane two prior to attempting a left turn into a driveway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Cadillac Deville sedan with one occupant, was traveling north in lane one. A non-contact driver, northbound in lane two, stopped prior to the driveway to allow V1 to complete the left turn. This non-contact driver motioned for the driver of V1 to make the left turn. The driver of V1 proceeded with the left turn when the front of V2 struck the right side of V1. Both vehicles came to rest just northeast of the area of impact. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 was a 51-year old male who reported no injuries, and the passenger was a 49 year-old female. The driver is familiar with the vehicle and drives the route daily. The driver stated that the cars in northbound lane two had stopped for him to make the left turn. As he turned he did not see V2 in lane one. The driver was conversing with his passenger at the time. Vehicles stopped in northbound lane two obstructed the driver's view of V2. The driver falsely assumed that the traffic lanes were clear since the non-contact driver motioned for V1 to proceed.
The driver of V2 was a 79-year old female who reported no injuries. Driver stated that she was traveling in lane one and that the other vehicle just popped out. She was able to brake but was unable to avoid the collision.
