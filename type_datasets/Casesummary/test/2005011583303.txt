The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a 2 lane, 2 way, level, ice covered, bituminous roadway curving left. At the time of the morning crash light was dawning, there were no adverse weather conditions but a recent snow squall had left the roadway ice covered.
V1, a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was westbound in lane 1 of the roadway. V2, a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am, was eastbound in lane 1 of the same roadway. V3, a 1993 Mitsubishi Mirage, was also eastbound in lane 1 of the same roadway a short distance behind V2. As V1 approached a non-contact vehicle on the right shoulder, the driver of V1 applied the foot brakes thinking the NC vehicle might pull onto the roadway. V1 lost control, rotated counterclockwise and southward across the centerline into lane 1. V2, front, contacted V1, rear. V1 continued to rotate counterclockwise while V2 came to rest on the north shoulder facing east. V3, left, then contacted V1, left, and came to rest on the south shoulder. V1 continued to rotate counterclockwise and came to rest on the north shoulder facing east. All three drivers were injured, transported, treated and released. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1. The driver stated that she was going down the road following a line of cars at about 64-72kph (40-45mph). There was a vehicle on the right shoulder. She thought he was going to pull out in front of her so she put on the brakes and slid out of control.
The movement of V1 was negotiating a curve, the Critical Pre-crash Event was this vehicle traveling too fast for conditions and the Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was slick roads due to ice. She was not late or in a hurry having traveled less than 30 minutes but reported that even though “she knew the roadway was very slick, she was just keeping up with traffic flow of 64-72kph (40-45mph).” The driver was found to be familiar with both the roadway and the vehicle. She was also properly licensed for the vehicle. There were indications of fatigue or a medical condition contributing to her actions but she was cited for traveling too fast for conditions. The vehicle inspection revealed no indications that the mechanical condition of the vehicle contributed to the cause of the crash.
A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection, with EDR download, was obtained for V2. The driver stated we were in the eastbound lane on the road going about 72kph (45mph). She had noticed and was talking about how slippery the road was. She saw the Jeep spin out of control and come across into her lane right in front of her. She hit the Jeep and then the Jeep hit the car behind her.
