The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a rural fully controlled highway, divided by a grassy median with trees. The bituminous roadway had two lanes in each direction with a posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph). The level roadway curved to the right and had paved shoulders with rumble strips on both sides. At the time of the crash it was an early weekend morning, daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2005 full-size Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck, was traveling westbound in the second lane of travel. V1 was driven by a 23-year old male who was returning from a week of working out of state, after driving through the night. The vehicle's cruise control was set at 70 mph. As the vehicle began to negotiate a right curve in the roadway, the driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel and V1 departed the roadway to the left in the curve. The driver woke up when the left wheels of the pick-up departed the paved shoulder. The driver braked and overcorrected, steering right, and V1 rotated clockwise and re-entered the roadway. The pick-up truck crossed both lanes and then the right shoulder, skidding in a clockwise rotation before departing the road on the right. As the truck left the road, its left side was leading (facing north) and moving northwest. The left back of V1 contacted and bent a delineator post on the roadside and continued down a 25 percent slope, rolling over 7 quarter turns with the left side leading. V1 came to rest on the passenger side facing north and was towed from the scene due to damage. The unrestrained adult lying down asleep in the second seat was transported to a local trauma center. The fully restrained driver and adult male right front passenger sustained minor injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
An additional associated factor was work related stress/pressure because the driver had been required to work extended shifts. The driver and passengers had driven 10 hours to the out-of-state work-site 6 days earlier, and worked 8, 11, 13, 12 and 13.5 hours on the intervening days, for a total of 57.5 hours in five days. The driver stated that the work was physically tiring and that they were all tired, but drove back because one of the passengers wanted to be home by the afternoon for a social event with his son. Immediately following the last workday, one of the passengers began to drive back to their home state until the driver took over after his nap. The driver stopped for a two-minute restroom break 45 minutes (and 57 miles) prior to the crash. The men were not running late and would have arrived home 4-5 hours before the planned activity. Additionally, the three men were scheduled to be at work the following morning.
Another associated factor was overcompensation, a performance error. The driver stated that because he was off of the road to the left when he woke up, he immediately jerked the steering wheel to the right and over-corrected, sending the pick-up into a clockwise rotation and off of the road on the right side.
Other associated factors were the driver's relative unfamiliarity with the road and with the work truck, which he had only driven that week, as it was his first week on the job, and the driver was not fully comfortable with the vehicle. In addition, the driver stated that he noticed prior to the rest stop that the truck felt like it had a flat tire and the vehicle seemed to be bouncing, but he found nothing wrong upon inspection.
The driver was cited for careless driving.
