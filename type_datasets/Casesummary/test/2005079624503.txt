This two-vehicle collision occurred during evening hours on a weekend. The crash occurred near the exit to a private drive on a six-lane, east-west roadway around dusk. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway is free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Civic, was traveling northbound out of the private drive, entering traffic and turning left into westbound traffic, with the intention of entering the fourth westbound lane, which was a left-turn lane on approach to an intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was traveling eastbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the second lane of a six-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. V2 had just traversed an intersection, and was approaching the private drive on its right. As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V2 continued on its path and came to rest in its original lane. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest facing generally south in the westbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
