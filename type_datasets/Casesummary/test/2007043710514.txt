The driver of V1 is a 24 year-old male who was not injured in this crash. On this night, himself and his wife enjoyed a nice dinner 10 minutes away and were on their way back to his grandmother's house to pick up their son and daughter. He said he was looking straight ahead, while his wife was talking on her cell phone to the grandmother letting her know they were on the way over. He said as he was passing in front of the gas station, V2 ran the stop sign from the right and entered into his path. He applied the brakes, locking them up, but that was all he could do. He braced the wheel and prepared for impact. He contacted the left side of V2. After impact his car spun counterclockwise, coming to rest at the impact point. He never saw V2 until it entered the intersection.
The driver of V2 is an 18 year-old male who not injured in the crash. He and a buddy had just come from picking up two girlfriends at their apartment complex. They were heading to the doughnut shop to hang out with other friends in the parking lot. He said as he approached the stop sign, he looked left, saw nobody coming, so decelerated, but did not stop with the intent to cross over and enter the parking lot. He did admit that he didn't stop but only because he saw nobody coming from the left. Once he entered the intersection, V1 struck his left side door without notice. None of the other passengers saw V1 coming either and it scared everyone. He then drove into the parking lot and waited for police.
