The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection. The north/south roadway has three lanes with lane one and two for northbound traffic and lane three for south bound traffic. The east/west roadway had four lanes and is separated by a raised curbed median. The road is straight and level. The conditions were dry and clear on a weekday night. The road was dark, but lighted.
V1 was a 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche pickup truck that was traveling westbound in lane three when he ran a red light and hit the right front of V2, a 2006 Nissan Murrano that was in lane two traveling northbound attempting to make a left turn. V2 hit the left side panel of V1 causing V1 to yaw to the left till it hit the raised curb of the median. V1 hit the curb with its front right tire and tripped over the curb. V1 rolled over four quarter turns and came to rest on its wheels in lane four of the eastbound traffic 64 meters away. The driver was transported due to injury and both V1 and V2 were towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 17-year-old male who was on his way home from work. The driver was traveling eastbound in lane three when he approached the intersection with speed. The driver was not able to stop in time for the red light and ran through the red light. He stated he didn't see V2, as it was dark in color. He hit the right front of V2 as V2 came through the intersection attempting to make a left turn. The truck lost control and spun to counterclockwise till it hit the curb and rolled over. The driver stated that it skidded on its hood then bounced back on to its wheels. The driver stated that he was able to get out of the truck himself, as he was scared someone was going to hit him again.
V2 was driven by a 23-year-old woman who was on her way from her home to a store. The driver stated that she lives right around the corner and drives the roadway daily. She stated that when the light turned green, she attempted to make a left turn to head east. The driver was almost in the middle of the intersection when her right front was hit by V1. She stated that the truck lost control and hit the curb then rolled over. She pulled her vehicle off the roadway and ran over to the truck to make sure the driver was ok.
