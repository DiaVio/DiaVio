A two-vehicle collision occurred on a weekday morning during daylight hours. The collision occurred in the three northbound lanes of a divided interstate highway interchange. The pre-crash roadway is a 4% downhill grade and straight, with bituminous paving. Access to the roadway is controlled. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 97 kmph (60 mph). Traffic was congested as it was near the end of the morning rush hour.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, was traveling north in lane two. Vehicle two (V2) a 2004 Nissan Quest was traveling north in lane three, an HOV lane. As V1 approached slower or stopped traffic ahead, V1 changed lanes to the left encroaching into the path of V2. V1's left side rear door area sideswiped with the right plane of V2 near the front corner and tire. After this impact V1 and V2 both traveled towards the center concrete barrier resulting in both vehicles impacting the barrier; V2 with its Left plane and V1 with its Front plane. V1 rode up the center barrier, and rolled one-quarter turn onto the passenger side. V1 traveled a short distance northbound on its right side, coming to rest facing northwest on its side in lane three. V2 stopped in lane three after impacting the cement center divider. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 was a 39-year-old male whose pre-crash factors are all unknown as he was unable to be reached for interview. Based on witness statements to the investigating officer, the driver of V1 was assigned the following contributing circumstances to this driver: did not grant right of way to vehicle; following too closely; and, exceeding a reasonable safe speed. Based on the information about the crash, this driver made a decision to change lanes to the left without sufficient clearance from V2. The crash circumstances indicate that this driver was taking the avoidance action to the forward traffic.
The driver of V2 was a 52-year-old female who is reportedly in good health, with no hearing restrictions. Her sight is corrected by lenses, which she was wearing at the time of collision. She was reportedly traveling along in the HOV/car-pool lane with the cruise control set at 93 kmph (58 mph). She was well rested with 8 hours of sleep the night before. She and her daughter were on their way to a counseling appointment, and were listening to a CD. They driver indicated that may have been conversing, but it wasn't about anything in particular. They were not in a hurry, and the driver was fairly familiar with the roadway, as she has been driving it monthly for a very long time. The driver of V2 claimed that V1 came out in front of them all of the sudden.
