This two-vehicle crash occurred in an intersection, with a stop sign control for the east/west secondary access road and no controls for the north/south primary roadway. For the north leg of the intersection traveling southbound, the roadway is straight and divided by a raised curbed median and consists of five lanes, four through lanes and one left turn lane. For the south leg of the intersection traveling northbound, the roadway is curved right and divided by a raised curbed median and consists of four through lanes. This north/south roadway is level with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This crash occurred during dusk with heavy rush hour congestion.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Subaru Loyale with one occupant, was southbound in lane five, the left turn lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford Windstar with one occupant, was northbound in lane one going straight. There was heavy traffic and northbound lanes two, three and four were stopped at the access road intersection to let V1 make its left turn into the shopping plaza. V2 was changing lanes from the number four lane to the number one lane as it approached the intersection. The driver of V1 started his turn at the same time V2 entered the intersection. V1 was impacted on the right side by V2's front. V1 was pushed northeast, sideways leading with its left side and came to rest on its wheels facing southeast in the north lane of the access road. After the impact, V2 pushed V1 northeast and came to rest on its wheels facing northeast in the middle of the access road. Both vehicles were towed from the scene of the crash with moderate damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 is a nineteen year-old male, who was driving from his parent's house back to his dorm. He was well rested and does not take any medications. He is near sighted, has an astigmatism and was wearing his glasses. He drives this roadway rarely and is very familiar with the vehicle.
The driver of V2 is a seventy-four year-old male, who was driving to a friend' house from home. He stated he had just turned left from an intersection south of this intersection and was getting over to the right lane so he could turn right at the next intersection (north of this intersection). He was well rested and takes Fish Oil, Vitamins and Levoflaxacin on a regular basis. He is hard of hearing and was wearing his hearing aid. He is far sighted and was wearing his glasses at the time.
An associative factor for both driver's was a sightline restriction due the northbound vehicles stopped in lanes two, three and four.
