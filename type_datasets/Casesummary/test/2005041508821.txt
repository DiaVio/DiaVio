The crash occurred in the intersection of two one-way streets. The southbound roadway consisted of three undivided lanes. The westbound roadway was also comprised of three undivided lanes. These were straight, level, bituminous roads. Southbound posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph). Westbound posted speed was 40 kmph (25 mph). Conditions were early afternoon on a weekday with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1996 Nissan Sentra with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane three. V2, a 1997 Ford Mustang with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection, which was controlled by a traffic light. The driver of V1 saw some overhanging branches in her travel lane, and decided to change lanes to the right. In doing so, V1 entered the intersection against a red light. As the two vehicles crossed through the intersection, the front of V1 made contact with the right side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
V1, the Nissan Sentra, was driven by a 28-year old female who was transported to the hospital with injuries. She stated that she was on her way back to work from her lunch hour. She was traveling in the far left lane at about 56 kmph (35 mph), when she noticed that there was an obstruction up ahead in her travel lane. It was some overhanging tree branches from the recent hurricane that had not been trimmed back yet. As she changed lanes into the middle lane, the driver said that she turned her head over her right shoulder to check her blind spot. When she focused her attention in front of her, she noticed that she was already in the intersection, under a red light. She hit another vehicle in the intersection and was temporarily knocked unconscious.
V2, the Ford Mustang, was driven by a 32-year old male who reported no injuries. He said that he was coming home from his mother's house. He needed to be in the far left lane in order to make his turn, but found himself in the far right lane, unable to move over. He stated that his light was green, and he was accelerating through the intersection at about 56 kmph (35 mph). As he entered the intersection, he saw the other vehicle, but it was too late. He didn't have time to take any avoidance actions.
