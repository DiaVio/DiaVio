A single-vehicle collision occurred during hours of darkness. The collision occurred at an uncontrolled intersection, in the westbound lanes. The roadway is a four-lane, one-way roadway with a median between lanes 2 and 3. The pre-crash roadway is a level, and straight with bituminous paving. It was previously raining, and the roadway was wet. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 40 Kmph (25 mph). Access to the roadway is not controlled.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Chevrolet K2500 Pickup with two occupants, was headed west in lane four. As V1 approached an uncontrolled intersection a non-contact vehicle changed lanes in front of him, cutting him off. The driver of vehicle 1 steered left, while braking, and hit a light pole on the southwest corner of the intersection. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Neither occupant was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 was a 28 year-old male who is reportedly in good health, with no hearing or sight restrictions. He is familiar with the roadway, and the vehicle as he drives both daily. He stated that a red colored car cut him off, and to avoid it, he steered left, ran off the roadway and struck the pole. He had just left his home and driven about 2 miles, and he was running to the grocery store, and was not in a hurry.
