This two-vehicle occurred at a four-way, traffic signal-controlled intersection. On the south side of the intersection, the roadway is divided by a raised median and the northbound traffic lanes consist of a left turn lane, two through lanes, and a right turn lane. This roadway curves left before the intersection, is downhill in the northbound direction, and has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This crash occurred during afternoon daylight hours with weekend traffic congestion.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Mustang with one occupant, was northbound in lane three approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix with two occupants, was stopped in lane four waiting to turn left at the intersection on a green light. The driver of V1 was intending to go straight, but saw that she couldn't stop in time to avoid a "chain-reaction" collision with non-contact vehicles that were stopped in front of her in lane three, so she changed lanes to lane four. She applied the brakes, but still wasn't able to stop and the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. V1 came to final rest facing north near the point of impact in lane four. V2 was driven from the scene before the researcher's arrival. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a thirty-six-year-old female, was listening to the radio while driving from her home to work. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle, and drives this route daily. She has a hiatal hernia and also has epilepsy, but says she hasn't had a seizure in over three years. She takes Depakote, Protonix, and Zonegran on a regular basis for these conditions. She offered no explanation for the crash, despite the researcher's probing inquiries.
The driver of V2, a sixty-three-year-old male, was driving from his home to have lunch with his wife, who was the right front passenger in the vehicle. He was well rested, very comfortable with his vehicle, and drives this route rarely. He has high cholesterol and takes Diovan and Advicor on a regular basis. They were stopped in the travel lane waiting for traffic to clear so that they could make a left turn when they were impacted from behind by V1.
