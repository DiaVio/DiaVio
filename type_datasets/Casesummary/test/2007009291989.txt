The crash occurred in an intersection on an east/west roadway. On the west side of the intersection, there were four eastbound lanes (including one left turn-only and one right turn-only lane). On the eastbound side there were four westbound lanes (including one left turn-only and one right turn-only lane). The east and westbound lanes were divided by a small raised cement median. There were four lanes in the north/south direction. This was a straight, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 64 kmph (40 mph) and a 2 percent downhill slope in the eastbound direction. It was early evening on a weekday and it was dark out but the roadway was illuminated by streetlamps. The roadway was dry and the sky was clear. This was a heavily traveled intersection and the traffic flow was moderate at that time.
V1, a 1998 GMC Yukon sport utility vehicle, was driven by a 39-year-old male traveling with one passenger. V1 was headed eastbound in lane three, passing through the intersection, when the accident occurred. The driver's actions were not known as his attorney refused to allow an interview. The driver was transported due to possible injuries. His ten-year old female passenger was uninjured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1996 Infiniti I30, was driven by a 23-year-old male who was on his way home after having left work two minutes prior to the accident. Prior to the accident, he stated that he had been stopped in lane four, the left turn lane of the westbound road, with the left turn indicator on. When the light turned green he checked that his path was clear and proceeded to make a left turn. As he was crossing over the eastbound lane three, a large black SUV (V1) came from his right and hit the right front portion of his vehicle with the front left portion of V1. He stated that his vehicle was spun counterclockwise and the right rear portion of his vehicle hit the left rear portion of V1. The driver was transported due to possible injuries.
