The crash occurred on an east/west, urban, business, six-lane roadway. The heavily traveled road was straight and level. Eastbound there were two lanes, westbound there were two through lanes with left and right turn lanes. The collision took place 130m west of an intersection that was controlled by a traffic signal. Eastbound traffic was heavy and coming to a stop for the signal. Conditions were daylight and dry during rush hour on a weekday morning. The posted speed limit was 72kmph (45mph).
Vehicle #2 was a 1995 Nissan pickup truck traveling east in the right lane. Vehicle #1, a 2001 Kia Optima, was eastbound behind Vehicle #2. The Nissan (V2) began to slow due to traffic at the controlled intersection ahead. Vehicle #2 had slowed to under 5mph when it was rear-ended by Vehicle #1. The vehicles came to rest at impact, but were pulled over to the right to allow traffic to continue to flow. Vehicle #1 was towed; Vehicle #2 was driven from the scene. Neither driver required medical attention. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 16-year-old female that was belted with no deployed airbags. She was on her way to the first day of school when the crash happened. The driver's father refused to cooperate on scene so further information on causal factors are unknown.
Vehicle #2 was operated by a 64-year old male that was belted with no deployed airbags. He was commuting and said he gradually slowed due to the traffic signal and was almost stopped when he was bumped from behind.
