This two-vehicle crash occurred in a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. Both trafficways are divided by a curbed median. Both approaches consist of three through lanes and a left turn lane. The eastbound approach is curved to the left, has an uphill grade and the speed limit for this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). The southbound approach is straight, has an uphill grade and the speed limit for this roadway is 64 kmph (40 mph). The road surfaces were dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. Shrubbery in the northwest corner of the intersection obstructed the view of both drivers.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Dodge Caravan, was traveling east in the second lane of traffic approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Toyota Avalon, was traveling south in the second lane. In the intersection, the front of V1 impacted the right side of V2. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest at the north tip of the south median, facing southwest. V2 rotated clockwise after the impact and came to rest 36.6 meters (120 feet) south of the intersection, within lanes two and three, facing west. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A 21-year old male drove V1, the 1998 Dodge Caravan, and was heading from his residence to a nearby bank. He said he was talking to his girlfriend, the right front occupant, while approaching the intersection. While looking at his girlfriend, he did not notice that the signal was red until he was already in the intersection.
A 72-year old male, drove V2, the 2006 Toyota Avalon. He stated he was in the second lane, traveling at a normal rate of speed. He was heading to lunch from his residence, where he works. He said he did not see V1 prior to the crash because of a wall protecting a residential area on the west side of the roadway. The maximum height of this hedge was measured at 4.95 meter (16.2 feet).
The sightline restriction created by the hedge was an associated factor in this crash.
