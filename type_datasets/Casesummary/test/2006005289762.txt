This two-vehicle crash occurred at dusk in the middle of a “T” intersection. The two roadways of the intersection were composed of two-lanes, one in each direction. The bituminous roadways were straight, with each having an uphill grade. There was a stop sign present for the northbound lane of travel, however there were no traffic control devices for the crossing traffic. It was raining heavily when the crash occurred and the roadways were wet. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35mph) for the east/west traffic and 40 kmph (25mph) for north/south traffic.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Expedition with one occupant, was northbound on the roadway approaching the T-intersection. It is unclear if the vehicle came to a stop at the stop sign controlling the traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford Focus, was eastbound intending to continue straight through the intersection. As V1 entered the intersection, attempting to make a left turn, its left front was struck by the front of V2. After the impact, V1 rotated clockwise approximately 10 degrees, coming to final rest facing north in the middle of the intersection. V2 came to final rest facing east in the eastbound lane in the middle of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 48 year-old male, was uninjured in the crash. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained with the driver of this vehicle. However a BAC test conducted on-scene reveled the driver to be intoxication with a BAC of .18.
The driver of V2, a 24 year-old male, was uninjured in the crash. The other occupant in the vehicle, in the front right seat, suffered non-incapacitating injuries and was transported for treatment. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be conducted with the driver of this vehicle.
