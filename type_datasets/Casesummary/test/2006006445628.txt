The two-vehicle crash occurred in a very large residential intersection where a heavily traveled east/westbound street intersected with a much smaller north/southbound street. Both streets had two lanes for travel in either direction and there were both legally and illegally parked vehicles on either side of each street. The east/westbound street had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) and the north/southbound street had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Both streets were controlled by standard traffic lights and the north/southbound traffic lights had pedestrian crossing signals. Each street was straight and level and had bituminous surfaces that were dry and free from any noticeable defects. The crash occurred on a clear weekend afternoon and traffic flow was very minimal.
V1, a 2000 Chrysler Concorde four door with two occupants was traveling eastbound in lane one of the east/westbound street. V2, a 2004 Toyota Corolla four door with two occupants was traveling southbound in lane one of the north/southbound street with the intention of making a left turn into the eastbound lane (lane one) of the east/westbound street. V3, a 1997 Toyota Camry was unoccupied and parked illegally along the south curb of the southeast corner. It was unknown whether V1 or V2 had the green light though it was known that the all traffic lights were functioning properly. As V1 and V2 traveled through the intersection the front of V1 struck the front and then the right side front of V2. As both V1 and V2 traveled to their final rests towards the southeast corner V1's left side scraped along V2's right side. Before V2 came to its complete rest, the front left corner of V2 struck the rear center bumper of V3, the illegally parked vehicle. All four occupants were transported directly from the scene to an emergency room for treatment of non-disabling moderate to major injuries including a broken left tibia which to V2 driver which required surgery and rehabilitation. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V1, the 2000 Chrysler Concorde was driven by a 50-year old female who, according to V1 driver's husband, had been out with their daughter. While at the crash scene to wait for V1 to be towed, he explained that his wife was very familiar with this roadway and he stated that he would have his wife contact the researcher to discuss the events of the crash. V1 driver later explained that upon her attorney's advice she was unable to discuss anything regarding the crash. V1 driver did disclose a few details, including but not limited to the fact that she had had her normal night's rest the previous evening, that she was in good health, that she was certain that she had the green light and that she didn't have a chance to take any avoidance maneuvers.
V2, the 2004 Toyota Corolla, was driven by a 79-year old female later explained in a very partial interview that she was traveling to her friend/occupant's home after a attending religious services and a luncheon. She stated that she saw that she had a green light and proceeded through the intersection and was ready to make her left turn when the next thing she knew, her vehicle was struck by V1. V2 driver stated that she never even saw V1 coming. It is known that V2 driver did not have a cell phone but it is unknown if V2 driver was engaged in any non-driving activities for example, talking with her passenger.
V3, the 1997 Toyota Camry, was quickly moved to a legal parking spot following the crash. V3 remained fully functional and sustained fairly minor damage to its rear bumper.
