This single-vehicle crash occurred on a six-lane highway that is divided by a grass median. The eastbound traffic lanes consist of three through lanes. This roadway is curved left, downhill, and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The crash occurred during the morning daylight hours. It was snowing with fog at the time of the crash and the roadway was wet and slick.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 GMC Yukon with two occupants, was eastbound in lane three negotiating the left curve. V1 lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise while departing the road on the left side. V1 continued to rotate counterclockwise before contacting a delineator post with its right side. V1 then continued on to contact a ditch with its right side. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and impact a sign with its left side. During this impact the sign contacted the vehicle a second time on its top. V1 came to rest in the median, on all four tires facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 121 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 was a thirty-three-year-old male. Little is known about this driver due to him not speaking English and reporting a telephone number that is incorrect. Medical records indicate he is a construction worker from Mexico visiting his girlfriend. Prior to the crash he was taking Afrin, a nasal decongestion medication. Alcohol consumption was not a factor for this driver.
