This two-vehicle crash occurred in a traffic signal-controlled interchange intersection on a dry, divided roadway. The southbound lanes are straight and level and consist of three through lanes and a left turn lane. The northbound lanes are curved to the right and uphill prior to the intersection and consist of two through lanes and a right turn lane. The speed limit on this roadway is 64 kph (40mph). The crash occurred during daylight hours and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 GMC Sierra pickup, was southbound in lane four, the left turn lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Mercury Sable, was northbound in lane two, the right through lane. There was a vehicle in front of V1 that turned left at the intersection and V1 followed. At the time V1 was turning left, V2 was proceeding straight through the intersection. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V1 continued with the turn and drove to final rest facing northeast on the left roadside of the eastbound roadway. V2 rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest facing northeast in the middle of the intersection in lane two. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, an eighteen-year-old male, had just picked up his sixteen-year-old nephew to go to the mall. This driver is familiar with his vehicle, but didn't remember how often he drives this route. He was well rested but had been driving only one year at the time of the crash. He was listening to the radio and when he saw the vehicle in front of him turn left, he assumed that he had the right-of-way.
The driver of V2, a fifty-year-old female, was traveling with a twenty-seven-year-old passenger. This driver refused to be interviewed.
