This crash occurred in a four-way intersection controlled by stop signs on the east and westbound approaches. All the approaches to the intersection were 2-lane undivided roadways with one lane going in each direction. All of the roadways involved were straight, level, and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The crash occurred in the early evening on a holiday eve and the roads were dry and the skies were clear. There was very little traffic on the roads due to the holiday and the traffic was moving steadily.
V1, a 2002 Mazda MPV minivan, was traveling west through the intersection in lane one intending on continuing straight through the intersection. V2, a 2007 Toyota Camry 4-door, was traveling south through the intersection in lane one intending on continuing straight through the intersection. As V1 approached the intersection, it slowed down for the stop sign but did not come to a complete stop. V1 proceeded into the intersection although the intersection was not clear. The driver of V2 saw V1 approaching the intersection but assumed that V1 would stop for the stop sign. However, when the driver of V2 realized that V1 was not completely stopping for the stop sign it was too late to avoid the accident. The front of V1 struck the left front of V2. Both of the vehicles came to final rest within approximately 5 meters of point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver was traveling west through the intersection and intending on continuing traveling straight. The driver approached the stop sign but only slowed down and failed to come to a complete stop. There were vehicles parked on the side of the road, which the driver claimed made it difficult for him to see far enough ahead to either side.
