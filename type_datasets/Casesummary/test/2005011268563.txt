The crash occurred in the westbound second lane of a four-lane straight, level, bituminous roadway at a T-intersection, with a roadway on the left, controlled by an on-colors traffic signal. The conditions were clear and dry on the weekend evening at dusk.
V1, a 1993 Ford Taurus, driven by a 19 year-old female, was following V2 in the left lane. The drivers of V1 and V2 were related and both traveling to the same destination, with V2 leading the way. V2, a 1993 Ford Crown Victoria, driven by a 43 year-old male, came to a stop at the intersection on the green light and was waiting for eastbound traffic to clear to make a left hand turn. The driver of v1 did not realize that V2 was stopping to turn and when she saw V2 stopped in front of her she applied the brakes, without locking up, and the front of v1 struck the back of V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Interviews were obtained for both drivers, although a language barrier existed for both. The driver of V2 was interviewed on-scene, with minimal problems, but the driver of V1 was interviewed over the phone via an interpreter, resulting in some unattainable information.
