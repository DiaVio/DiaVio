This two-vehicle crash occurred during the late-evening hours of a weekend. The collision took place on an urban roadway in a four-way intersection. The northbound roadway consisted of one travel lane. The east and westbound roadway consisted of four travel lanes; two in each direction, divided by a raised curb median. The north/south roadway had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The east/west bound roadway had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). The surface type for both roadways was that of bituminous asphalt. The roadways were flat, dry, and level, without any indications of physical damage. Weather conditions were dark and clear and streetlights were present to illuminate the roadways.
Vehicle one, a 1988 Lincoln LSC Mark coupe, was traveling westbound in lane one of the roadway. According to a witness on-scene, the driver proceeded to change over into the left lane in order to pass two stopped vehicles in the right lane and then changed back into the right lane. From there, the driver entered the intersection on a red traffic light. The front of V1 struck V2, a 1996 Ford Explorer, on its right side. Both occupants of V1 were transported to a medical facility for treatment. The driver of V1 was later arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. V2 also had two occupants, both of whom were transported to a medical facility. Both vehicles sustained moderate to severe damage and were both towed from the scene.

The driver of V2, a 35 year-old male, in generally good health, stated he was on coming from his home on his way to his girlfriend's mother's house when the crash occurred. He related that he was passing through the intersection (traveling northbound) and saw the other vehicle (V1) coming at him. He proceeded to apply his brakes (without lockup) but was not successful.
