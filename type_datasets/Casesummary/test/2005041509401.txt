The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, ten-lane interstate roadway, divided by a concrete barrier wall. There were five southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a level, asphalt roadway, which curved slightly to the right. Conditions were dark with streetlights, on a weekday evening. The roadway was dry and skies were clear. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1996 BMW Z3 Convertible with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane three. V2, a 1997 Isuzu Rodeo with one occupant, was traveling in the same lane, far ahead of V1. V1, traveling at a higher rate of speed, quickly caught up with V2. V1 steered left at the last second in an attempt to avoid V2. The right front corner of V1 made contact with the left rear corner of V2. V2 began to rotate in a clockwise direction toward the right shoulder of the roadway, overturning along the way. V2 rolled left a total of four-quarter turns, down a grassy embankment off the right side of the roadway. V2 came to final rest upright, on its tires. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 129 kmph for V1 and 129 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 58-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was coming home from a bar, where he had a few drinks. He said he had just gotten on the interstate and was heading home. He could not recall very many details of the crash. The driver indicated that he had been arrested on the scene for being under the influence of alcohol.
V2 was driven by a 35-year old male, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. He said he was on his way to do an errand. He stated that he was in the middle lane, going about 96 to 105 kmph (60 to 65 mph). Seemingly out of nowhere, the other driver hit him from behind without warning. The impact was severe enough that the driver could not maintain control of his vehicle.
