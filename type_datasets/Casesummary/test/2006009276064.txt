This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday at the intersection of a two-lane, two-way, undivided roadway, and a driveway to a school. The bituminous north/south roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). It was daylight and clear and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2001 Nissan Altima, was southbound on the roadway approaching the driveway where it intended to turn left. V2, a 1999 Nissan Altima, was northbound on the roadway approaching the driveway intersection at constant speed. V1 slowed and began to turn across V2's lane of travel into the driveway. As V1 turned it was struck on the right side by the front of V2. After impact V1 rotated counter-clockwise before coming to final rest facing west in the driveway to the school. V2 came to final rest near the point of impact in the middle of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 56 year-old female who was traveling to the school to pick up her daughter. Fire Rescue had to extract the driver and two passengers from the vehicle for treatment. Before being taken away to receive treatment for minor injuries she stated that she did not think that V2 was coming up that fast. This driver could not be located to complete the interview.
V2 was driven by a 52 year-old male who was commuting home from work. He stated that V1 just turned right in front of him. He slammed on his brakes and swerved to the right but could not avoid hitting V1. The driver of V2 was not injured in the crash.
