These were straight, level, bituminous roadways with a north/south posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) and an east/west posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). Conditions were early afternoon on a weekday with clear skies and dry roads.
V1, a 1993 Toyota Camry with two occupants, was traveling southbound in lane four (left turn lane). V2, a Geo Metro with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane three. V3, a 2002 Lexus RX300 with two occupants, was stopped facing westbound, in lane one. The three vehicles were approaching the same intersection. V1 and V2 had a green light. V1 attempted to make a left turn. The front of V2 made contact with the right rear side of V1. V1 continued eastbound and its left side made contact with the front of V3. The passenger of V1 was transported due to injuries. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
V1, the Toyota Camry, was driven by a 22-year old female who reported no injuries. She stated that she was driving her sister home from school. She intended to turn left at the intersection. She said that her light was green, but she did not have a green arrow. She believed that the oncoming driver was in his left turn lane, so she initiated her turn.
V2, the Geo Metro, was driven by a 46-year old male who reported possible injuries and was treated on scene. The driver declined to be interviewed pending litigation. He did confirm however, that he was in the through lane, intending to go straight when the crash occurred.
V3, the Lexus RX300, was driven by a 38-year old male who reported no injuries. According to the driver, he and his passenger were in the area looking at real estate. He was stopped at a traffic light, facing westbound. V1 and V2 collided in the intersection. The driver stated that the impact pushed V1 into the front of his vehicle.
V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, no Critical Pre-crash Event or Critical Reason was coded to the driver of the Lexus RX300. This driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
