This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a two-way intersection. The intersection joined three eastbound lanes, one wide southbound intersecting lane. Curbside parking was permitted on both sides of the east/southbound travel lanes. The intersection was controlled by signalized traffic control devices. The bituminous roads were dry, level, and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash occurred on a weekend during the early afternoon daylight hours and the roadway was free of any defects and the traffic flow was normal for this roadway.
Vehicle one, a 2001 New Flyer Large Passenger Bus, was traveling eastbound in lane one entered the intersection and contacted with its front the right side of vehicle two, a 2007 Ford Explorer Compact Utility vehicle, traveling southbound through the same intersection. After the initial impact, vehicle one continued traveling several feet and came to final rest facing its intended direction. Vehicle two, after the initial impact, traveled several feet, rotated 180 degrees clockwise and came to final rest facing northward. Damages to vehicle two were disabling and resulted in it being towed from the scene. Vehicle one's damages were minor and it was not towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
The driver of vehicle one, a 37-year old male, said he was traveling eastbound on his normal bus route on a not too busy afternoon. He stopped at the corner before entering the intersection and then proceeded as vehicle two all of a sudden came from his left front and the two vehicles collided. He realized the traffic signals were not working; there were no lights. Before entering the intersection, he did not see vehicle two and he was only traveling about 25 mph. He explained that he is a professional driver and has been driving passenger buses for over 8-years. When questioned whether he could have looked in his rearview mirror or turned his head just before entering the intersection, he replied “I'm not sure, but, I'm a professional driver and I'm use to that style of driving”. He travels this route daily and has been a licensed driver for 20-years. Neither he nor any of his passengers were injured.
The driver of vehicle two, a 72-year old male, said he'd just left his home a few minutes ago to visit friends and to take a ride. As he was approaching the intersection, he thought the traffic lights were not working right. During the interview we saw that the lights, for his direction, were functioning properly. Later when questioned about the traffic lights and he was assured the information was confidential, he said the light stayed green for a longer time, he thought, and he assumed they were broken. He said he made the initial statement because the driver of vehicle one said they were and his vehicle was struck. He's an experience driver licensed for 55-years and travels on this roadway weekly. He was transported to the hospital directly from the scene with complaints of pain in his neck and back.
