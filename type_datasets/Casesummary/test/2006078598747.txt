This two-vehicle crash occurred at the intersection of a seven-lane, divided roadway and a two-way two-lane roadway leading from a convenience store. The seven-lane, divided road has two northbound and five southbound lanes separated by a raised concrete divider. The crash occurred at the point where the two eastbound lanes intersect with the east/west roadway. The roadways are straight and level. There were no traffic controls present for either roadway. The two northbound lanes had a posted speed limit of 73 kmph (45 mph). There was no posted speed limit for the cross street. This crash occurred during early daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Toyota Tundra pickup, was stopped in the intersection leading from a driveway facing west, at the intersection of the two northbound lanes. The driver intended to turn right. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda S-2000 convertible, was exiting a military installation and making a left turn to go north. V1 lost control while accelerating, entered a counter clockwise rotation and departed the right road edge at the intersection. The right side of V1 struck the left side of V2 that remained stationary. V1 then swerved left, crossed both northbound lanes and came to a stop on the raised divider facing northwest. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise more than 180 degrees and came to rest at the north edge of the driveway facing southeast. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was not towed. Neither driver was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
