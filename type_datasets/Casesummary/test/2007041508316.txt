The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, five-lane undivided roadway. The center lane consisted of a two-way left turn lane. There were two southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and cloudy skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1997 Ford Taurus 4-door with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. The driver traveled off the roadway to the right, partially onto the sidewalk. The right front of V1 made contact with a tree, causing it to overturn and re-enter the roadway. The vehicle rolled left, two-quarter turns, coming to final rest on its rooftop in the center lane, facing southbound. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The Ford Taurus was driven by a 34-year old male, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. He said that he was at home resting, when he received a phone call from the hospital or the police, stating that his girlfriend had been in a car crash. The driver, who was heavily sedated with painkillers and anti-depressants, could not process the information he had been given by police. All he could remember about the conversation was that his girlfriend had been in a car crash. The driver, who lives with his parents, apparently took their vehicle without their knowledge. The motorist got into the vehicle and began driving. He indicated during the interview that he did not have a specific destination in mind, because he did not know where his girlfriend was. Instead, he drove around aimlessly, worriedly looking for her. He could not explain how the crash happened, other than to comment on the narrowness of the travel lanes. A check of the hospital admission records confirmed that his girlfriend had in fact been involved in a vehicle crash shortly before his, and was being treated at the same hospital. During the interview at the hospital following the crash, the driver lost consciousness several times, and was clearly incoherent most of the time.
