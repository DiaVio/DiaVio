V1, a 1996 Chevy Cavalier with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane five, approaching an intersection. V2, a 2004 Freightliner truck-tractor without trailer, was stopped in lane six, ahead of V1. V2 also had one occupant. Both V1 and V2 intended to turn left at the intersection. As the driver of V1 approached, he saw that V2 was stopped. The driver of V1 decided to pass V2 on the right and enter the fifth lane of travel, which was also a left turn lane. V2 was in the process of changing lanes when the driver noticed a non-contact vehicle entering lane five from lane four. The driver of V1 swerved back into lane six. The front left of V1 made contact with the back of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest within 5 meters (16 ft.) of each other. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Chevy Cavalier, was driven by a 21-year old male who reported thermal burns from airbag deployment, but refused treatment. He advised that he had come from the bank, and was heading home. As he got closer to the intersection he began to decelerate, and decided to go around V2. As he changed lanes, he noticed a non-contact vehicle entering the same lane. The driver stated that he was traveling at about 48 kmph (30 mph) when he made the evasive action to avoid hitting the vehicle next to him. He successfully avoided the non-contact vehicle, but was unable to stop in time to avoid rear-ending V2.
