Vehicle #1 was a 2000 Ford Ranger pickup that was attempting to exit a private drive on the south side of the highway. Vehicle #2, a 1994 Nissan Sentra, was traveling east on the highway in the right lane. The Ranger (V1) initiated a left turn from the private drive and was struck on the left front by the front of the Sentra (V2). A secondary side-slap followed with the left rear of Vehicle #1 and Vehicle #2's right rear contacting. After impact, Vehicle #1 rotated 180 degrees clockwise before rolling one-quarter turn and coming to rest facing south on its left side in the right eastbound lane. Vehicle #2 rotated 90 degrees and came to rest facing south also in the right eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 78-year old male that was belted with a deployed driver's airbag. He was hospitalized several days due to injuries sustained in the crash. Witness stated that he exited the parking lot, pulling into the path of Vehicle #2. At time of case submission, charges were still pending against Vehicle #1's driver.
Vehicle #2 was operated by a 32-year old male who was not belted. The vehicle was not equipped with airbags. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. He was making a delivery and had traveled about three miles when the crash took place. Several witness stated that although the pickup (V1) pulled into the path of Vehicle #2, V2 appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed. There were no pre-impact skid marks present.
