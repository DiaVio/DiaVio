The crash occurred on an east/west roadway in the middle of a four-way intersection. In both directions, the approach to the intersection consisted of four lanes, with lane one being a right turn-only lane, lane four a left turn-only lane, and lanes two and three straight-only. The intersection was controlled by traffic signals. The east and westbound traffic was separated by a raised curbed median. Conditions were dry and clear on a weekday morning during rush hour. The roadway was straight and level. The posted speed was 64 kmph (40 mph).
V1 was a 1998 Buick Park Avenue sedan that was traveling east and attempting to make a left turn from lane four. The light was green and the driver initiated a left turn in front of V2, a 2007 Dodge Caravan that was traveling west in lane two. The driver of V2 had a green light and was passing through the intersection when V1 turned left in front of her. Both vehicles were towed due to damages and the driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital with injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 70-year-old female who was on her way home from the store. She was trying to turn left and she stated that her light was green. In this particular intersection the traffic light has a green arrow for a while and then goes to a solid green light, indicating that the driver must yield the right of way to oncoming traffic and can turn when traffic permits. The driver stated that the light was a solid green and she thought it was ok to make a left turn. She stated that she assumed that since her light was green that the oncoming traffic signal would be red and she had the right of way, which was not the case. She was ticketed for causing the crash and was cited for failure to yield the right of way when turning left.
V2 was driven by a 43-year-old female who was vacationing and on her way to the airport to pick up some friends. She said she was traveling westbound in lane two going 35 mph. As she was passing through the intersection V1 just turned left in front of her. She hit the brakes in an attempt to avoid a crash but was unsuccessful and hit the right front of V1.
