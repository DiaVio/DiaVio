The crash occurred in the evening of a holiday weekend in the southbound lanes of a divided (raised concrete median) urban roadway. The bituminous roadway featured four lanes with lane four serving as a left-turn only lane and a posted speed limit of 64kmph (40 mph). The roadway was dry, straight, and level. The were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and the sun was still out, but the traffic flow was interrupted due to a previous crash in lane one of the southbound lanes.
V1, a 2000 Ford Crown Victoria (which served as a taxi cab), was southbound in lane two traveling the speed limit. V2, a 2004 Ford F-250, was also southbound in lane two ahead of V1. V3, an unknown vehicle, was stopped in lane two ahead of V2. As V2 stopped abruptly behind V3, V1 was unable to stop in time and contacted the rear of V2. V2 was subsequently pushed into the back of V3. All vehicles came to final rest in the lane two slightly south of the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by 33 year-old male who worked as a taxi cab driver and was on duty at the time of the crash. He said he was traveling in lane two when the truck in front of him (V2) suddenly slammed on his brakes. The driver stated he in turn applied his brakes but could not avoid hitting V2. Neither the driver nor passenger in V1 were injured but V1 was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a 29 year-old male who was on his way home after dining out. He stated in the interview that he was looking to the right at a previous crash that had just occurred before the crash. When he finally looked forward he saw V3 stopped in front of him and he slammed on the brakes, just barely avoiding V3. Shortly there after he was struck from behind by V1 and pushed into V3. The driver was not injured and he was able to drive V2 from the scene.
