The crash occurred in the middle of an intersection of an east/west roadway and a north/south roadway. The southbound approach to the intersection consisted of four lanes southbound and three lanes northbound, divided by a raised curb median. Of the four southbound lanes, lane one was a right turn-only lane, lane two and three were straight-only lanes, and lane four was a left turn-only lane. The westbound approach had two westbound lanes with lane one being a right turn-only lane and lane two being a straight or left turn lane. There was one eastbound lane. The conditions were cloudy and rainy on a weekday afternoon. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle 1 was a 2001 Honda Civic that was traveling westbound in lane one (the right turn-only lane). The driver was a 35-year-old woman who was on her way home from grocery shopping. It was noted by two witnesses on scene that the driver of V1 ran the red light. As V1 ran the red light, the front of V1 struck the right rear side of V2, a 2006 Mercedes CLK 350 convertible that was traveling westbound in lane two. The driver of V2 was a 58-year-old male who was on his way to the movies with his wife. The impact with V1 caused V2 to rotate clockwise, coming to final rest facing southeast in the first westbound lane. After impact, V1 continued on in a southerly direction through the intersection, coming to final rest on the southwest corner. Both vehicles were towed due to damage and no one was injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
In her interview, the driver of V1 stated that she did run the red light, but had tried to hit the brakes to stop and was not able to in time. The driver also was only driving with a learners permit. She was cited for failure to stop for a traffic control device and driving without a license. The driver stated that she was attempting to turn right at the intersection. It was believed that after the impact with V2, the driver of V1 hit the gas instead of the brakes and she continued forward across the intersection where she drove up and over a curb on the southwest corner of the intersection.
