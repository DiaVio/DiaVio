This crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the middle of a 4-way residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a two-lane north/south roadway controlled by stop signs and a four-lane east/west roadway (two lanes in each direction). Both roadways were bituminous, straight and level. The north/south roadway had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) while the east/west roadway had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The roadway was wet as it was raining at the time of the crash.
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 1994 Ford Escort LX, was stopped facing south at the stop sign of the intersection preparing to turn left. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Impala was westbound in lane two approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. A large municipal work vehicle (Non-contact vehicle) was also westbound in lane one along side and slightly ahead of V2. As the work vehicle began a right turn at the intersection, V1 began its left turn and pulled out into the path of V2. The front left corner of V1 was struck by the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest facing southwest in the middle of the intersection. V1 was towed from the scene while V2 was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 33-year-old female, and her passenger were not injured in the crash. She stated as she came to the stop sign she looked in each direction and noted a large work van coming to the intersection with its right turn signal on. She could not see around it but thought the way was clear. She did not see V2 until she began her left turn and entered the intersection.
The driver of V2, a 50-year-old female, suffered minor injuries but did not require treatment or transport. She was on her way to the Post Office and traveling west in lane two. As she approached the intersection she noted a large work truck that she believed was stopped in lane one. She stated that she did not see V1 stopped at the stop sign and as she passed the work truck, V1 entered her lane of travel and she could not avoid it.
