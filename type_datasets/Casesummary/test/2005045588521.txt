The crash occurred at the intersection of a north/south four-lane arterial roadway and a two-lane interstate entrance/exit ramp. The arterial was divided by a raised concrete median and had a crossover to the ramp. It was straight and level for northbound traffic and straight with a 3 percent downgrade for travelers approaching the crossover from the south. Approximately 75 meters south of the crossover, southbound traffic on the arterial merged down to one lane. The ramp intersected on the west side of the arterial and had one lane in each direction. There was also a curved entrance ramp lane that intersected 53 meters north of the crossover for vehicles traveling south on the arterial turning west on the entrance ramp. At the end of the exit ramp a stop sign was present but there were no controls on the arterial road. Conditions were daylight, clear, and dry on a weekday during morning rush hour. Traffic would be considered heavy in the area and the speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle #1 was a 2003 Toyota Highlander stopped facing eastbound at the end of the exit ramp waiting to turn left and proceed north on the arterial. Vehicle #2, a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado pickup, was traveling southbound in the right lane on the four-lane arterial. Vehicle #3 was a 1987 Chevrolet V10 series pickup going northbound on the arterial attempting to turn left and go west on the entrance ramp. Vehicle #3 attempted to turn left and was struck in the right side by the front of Vehicle #2. The impact pushed Vehicle #3 westward and its front contacted the front of Vehicle #1. After impact, Vehicle #2 came to rest facing southwest in the intersection and caught on fire. The Toyota (V1) came to rest near its initial location and Vehicle #3 came to rest in the southwest corner of the intersection facing southwest. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 45-year old female that was belted with no deployed airbags. She was not injured in the crash. She stated that the older pickup turned left in front of the newer pickup and the impact pushed the vehicles into the front of hers.
No Critical Pre-crash Event and No Critical Reason were coded to Vehicle #1 because it was not involved in first harmful event. The driver takes a prescription medication for a heart condition but the driver did not contribute to the crash.
Vehicle #2 was operated by a 35-year old male that was belted with deployed frontal airbags. He was treated and released from an area hospital with minor injuries. He reported that he was traveling south in the right lane on the arterial. He intended to turn right at an intersecting entrance to a business park approximately 125 meters south of the intersection, but stated that he did not yet have on his turn signal. EDR pre-crash data was extracted from the vehicle and indicated that he was traveling between 72 kmph (45 mph) and 77 kmph (48mph) in the five seconds prior to algorithm enable. Between -4 and -3 seconds the percent of throttle dropped from 37 to 24 percent and the driver applied the brakes between -2 and -1 prior to AE. The maximum adjusted algorithm velocity change for the deployment event was 23.7 kmph (14.73 mph).
In observing traffic patterns in the area it appears that southbound vehicles turning right into the business park commonly signal a right turn so that vehicles in the left southbound lane know that they won't be merging left as the lanes decrease from two to one. The business park entrance is just south of the lane convergence. Therefore, the researcher believes that Vehicle #2's driver activated his right turn signal as he approached the intersection.
Vehicle #3 was driven by an 80-year old male that was belted and not injured in the collision. His residence was 100 meters south of the intersection on the east side of the arterial road. He stated that he stopped at the crossover and waited for traffic to clear before beginning to turn left. He said he saw the other pickup truck but assumed it was turning right on the entrance ramp because its turn signal was activated.
