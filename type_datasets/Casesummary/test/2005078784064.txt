This is a two vehicle intersection crash that occurred around noon and involves a passenger car and a straight truck. The posted speed limit for southbound travel was 56 kmph (35 mph) and the posted speed limit for eastbound was 40 kmph (25 mph). There were no design deficiencies and the weather was clear.
Vehicle one (V1), a white 1993 Honda 2 door sedan, was southbound on a urban, two lane, dry, straight and level bituminous roadway with no traffic controls present. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 GMC truck chassis with delivery box attached, was eastbound on a two lane urban intersecting roadway controlled by a stop sign. V2 approached the stop sign and came to a complete stop. V2 entered the intersection and was struck on the left rear dual wheels by the front of V1. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
V1 was traveling south and the sight line is somewhat restricted due to large amounts of vegetation on the northwest corner and west side of the southbound roadway. V1 approached the intersection after rapidly accelerating from a side street further north, saw V2 crossing in front of him, applied hard braking with lockup, the brakes grabbed, veered left and struck the left rear dual wheels of V2 just east of the centerline. The driver of V1 was a 17-year-old male who was transported with injuries and the vehicle was towed due to damage. V2 was not towed and the occupants were not transported. V2 was driven by a 24-year-old male.
