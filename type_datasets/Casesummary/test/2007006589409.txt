This one-vehicle crash occurred during the evening hours of a weekend. The collision took place on a divided urban north/south roadway. There were two southbound lanes and two northbound lanes. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph). The roadway was dry, straight, bituminous, and had a negative grade. There were no indications of physical damage. Weather conditions were clear and cold. It was dark out, but there were streetlights to illuminate the roadway.
V1, a 1997 Honda Accord 4-door sedan, was traveling southbound in lane one of the roadway. The driver was cut off by another vehicle that tried to merge into the same lane as V1. V1 steered right and departed the roadway. It then made contact with a fence/wall with its front right and ricocheted over the center median, crossed over two lanes of oncoming traffic, and struck another fence/wall before coming to final rest. No information was obtained from the no-contact vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a 24 year-old female, said she was traveling southbound in lane one of the roadway when another vehicle, traveling in lane two, crossed in front of her vehicle and she steered right to avoid the collision. She hit the wall and her airbag exploded, blocking her view as she continued to bounce off the wall/fence and into another one. The driver is a waitress who works a lot of hours and who gets tired, depressed, and argues often. She was going to visit a friend with whom she had just finished arguing. She normally takes prescription antidepressant medication, but related that she was a mess on the day of the crash.
