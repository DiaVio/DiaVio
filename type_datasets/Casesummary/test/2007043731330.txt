This two-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a 4-way intersection. The intersection consists of a divided 2-lane main thoroughfare, which runs north and south, and two intersecting PVA entrance roads. The main roadway does not have traffic signal for this intersection and the posted limit is 56 kmph (35 mph). The intersecting roads have a stop sign at the intersection but there are not posted speed limit signs. The weather conditions were clear, dry, daylight and the traffic level was low.
V1, a 2006 Chevrolet Express Cargo Van with two occupants, was stopped at this intersection facing west, intending to turn left. V2, a 1995 Honda Accord LX with one occupant, was northbound in lane two approaching the intersection, intending to go straight. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V1 struck the right of V2. V1's driver was not injured in the crash but V2's driver was transported to a trauma center for minor injuries. V1 was driven from the scene but V2 had to be towed even though the crash report reads the V2 was drivable. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 48-year-old male that works as a HVAC repairperson and was driving his work van this afternoon when he was involved in this crash. He and his co-worker had just left a supply store and were traveling to a client's home when they stopped at this intersection, intending to turn left. After looking left (south) and right (north) for oncoming traffic, this driver assumed the intersection was clear and he began to turn south. As soon as he entered the intersection (he was looking north), he heard tires squealing and then felt an impact to the left/front corner of the van. His van struck by V2, which he claims he never saw before the crash.
The driver of V2 is a 31-year-old female that was commuting from home to work this afternoon when she was involved in this crash. She said she was driving straight (north) approaching this intersection when V1 pulled out in front her. She said it was "horrific crash" and she does not like to talk about it. She did not provide a detailed answer for any of the survey questions and was very defensive throughout the interview.
