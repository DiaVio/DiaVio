The crash occurred on a two-way, eleven-lane interstate roadway, divided by a concrete curbed median. There were six northbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were dark with streetlights on a weekday evening. The roads were wet, and there was a light rainfall. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2000 Ford Taurus with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane two. The driver suddenly felt the vehicle start to pull to the right, rotating clockwise. The back left corner of V1 made contact with a guardrail. V1 was then redirected back onto the roadway. V1 came to final rest between lanes two and three. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
V1, the Ford Taurus, was driven by a 55-year old male, who refused treatment. He was on his way home from work, and was in one of two exit lanes to an adjoining interstate. Because of the light rainfall and the approaching exit, the driver eased off the gas pedal. For unknown reasons, the driver felt his vehicle start to pull to the right in a clockwise direction. The driver's vehicle continued rotating as it traveled toward the guardrail. The driver stated that he could see the steering wheel spinning on him. He remembered that just before the control loss, he had both hands on the wheel. He indicated that he was not turning, changing lanes, or applying the brakes, and he did not hydroplane. The driver did say that the next day after the crash, he observed a large plastic wrap twisted tightly around the rotor of his left rear wheel. He described the object as an industrial strength material, such as the type of plastic that is wrapped around commercial shipping crates and palates. The driver exclaimed that he attempted to pull the material away from the rotor with all of his strength, but could not. He was certain that the material was not present prior to his leaving work, and that he must have picked it up as he was driving home that evening.
