This single-vehicle crash occurred on a jersey barrier-divided, east/west trafficway. The eastbound roadway was straight, uphill, dry and consists of five lanes. There is a highway exit ramp at the location. Lane one is a through lane with an exit ramp to the right. The posted speed limit is 97 kmph (60 mph) with an advisory exit speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). Traffic was moderate at the time of the crash. The roadway was under construction at the time of the collision. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear skies.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Acura Integra, was eastbound in the first travel lane. V1 departed the roadway on the right side, entered the gore area and the front of V1 struck an impact attenuator separating the through lanes from the exit ramp. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing northwest in the exit ramp. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a twenty-eight year old male, was heading to his wife's residence from home. This driver had been driving for about twenty-five minutes, drives the route weekly and is familiar with the vehicle. The driver stated he was attempting to exit when another vehicle cut him off. He stated that he steered to the left and braked, causing him to strike the traffic barrier. The physical evidence does not support this scenario.
