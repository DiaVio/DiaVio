The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a north/south highway with a concrete barrier wall as a median. The southbound side had four lanes narrowing to three at the place of the crash and was beginning a curve left. Access to the highway was fully controlled with on and off ramps. The grade measurement at 150 meters north of the roadway departure was -5% and the grade measurement at the pre-crash location 65 meters north of roadway departure was +9% with a superelevation in the curve of +7.5%. There was an embankment on the right side of the road at the departure point with a grade of -23% and then a concrete drainage ditch to the right of that which was approximately 1.5 meters wide and ran parallel to the roadway. The embankment to the right of that had a grade of +29%. The crash occurred in the early morning hours on a weekday during rush hour under rainy and overcast conditions. The posted speed limit was 89 kmph/55 mph.
Vehicle #1, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up, was southbound in the left lane when the vehicle hydroplaned in a dip between the negative and positive grades in the roadway. The vehicle began to yaw left in the left curve. The driver steered right to correct the yaw and the vehicle skidded across all the lanes of traffic and off of the right shoulder, departing the roadway on the right side. It went down an embankment into a drainage ditch, which tore the left rear wheel from the vehicle, before going up the embankment on the other side of the drainage ditch. Vehicle #1 then coasted back down the same embankment and came to rest partially in the drainage ditch approximately 40 meters south of roadway departure. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a twenty-three year old unbelted female who sustained minor injuries in the crash and was transported to a local trauma center for treatment. The airbags did not deploy. The driver stated that she was doing the speed limit and maintaining a following distance of thirty feet.
