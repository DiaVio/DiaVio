The crash occurred off the right side of an undivided four-lane roadway at an intersection with a two-lane roadway. The intersection was controlled by a traffic control signal. Conditions were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday. The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph).
V1 was a 2005 Chevy Impala sedan traveling westbound in the right lane approaching a green traffic control signal intending on continuing straight. There was a flatbed tractor-trailer in the left lane intending on making a wide right-hand turn at the intersection. V1 then accelerated to try and pass the truck but ended up steering hard to the right and departed the right side of the roadway and struck a traffic pole and several shrubs. The traffic pole then fell and took down a utility pole, which then struck a pedestrian. V1 did not make any contact with the truck or the pedestrian. V1 came to final rest facing westbound against the bushes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
