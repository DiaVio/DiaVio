The crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The north/south roadway was a two-way, three-lane undivided street, controlled by a stop sign. The east/west roadway was a two-way, three-lane undivided street, without a traffic control device. These were straight, level, asphalt roads, with an unknown posted speed. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2000 Ford Mustang with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. V2, a 2006 Honda Pilot with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane two. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the two vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V1 made contact with the left side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
V1, the Ford Mustang, was driven by a 63-year old female, who was not injured. She stated that she just got off work. She normally takes a different route from work, one that she is more familiar with. She was headed south, as she approached the intersection, she didn't see a stop sign, so she thought it was an uncontrolled traffic way in her direction. The driver stated that she slightly reduced her speed, as she usually does when entering an intersection, but did not stop. She also stated that she was thinking about work, and a six-thirty appointment. The driver insisted that she looked for a traffic signal, but that the stop sign was completely covered by tree leaves and branches.
V2, the Honda Pilot, was driven by a 74-year old female, who refused treatment. She could not be reached for an interview.
