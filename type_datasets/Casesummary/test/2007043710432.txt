This four-vehicle multi-event crash occurred at an urban, signal-controlled 4-way intersection. The northbound approach was level and curved left. There were five lanes present; three northbound and two southbound lanes divided by a curbed grass median. The southbound approach was straight and level. There were six lanes present; four southbound lanes and two northbound lanes divided by a curbed grass median. The eastbound approach curved left with a steep downhill profile. There were two eastbound lanes and two westbound lanes divided by a curbed grass median. The posted speed limit for north/south traffic was 72 kmph/ 45mph; eastbound traffic had no posted speed limit. The setting was afternoon hours on a weekend. Conditions were daylight, dry and clear.
V1 was a 1992 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan with one occupant traveling northbound in lane three, the left turn lane. V2 was a 2004 Cadillac CTS four-door sedan with one occupant traveling southbound in lane three. V3 was a 2007 Honda Accord four-door sedan with one occupant stopped in eastbound lane two. V4 was a 2006 Pontiac G6 four-door sedan stopped in eastbound lane one. There was a stopped non-contact vehicle (a large van) in southbound lane four. The non-contact vehicle obstructed V1's view of southbound traffic. V1 approached the intersection and proceeded with its left turn. V1 accelerated in an attempt to avoid being struck by V2. V2 braked and steered right in an attempt to steer around the front of V1, leaving a 15-meter (49 feet) right-front yaw mark. The front plane of V1 contacted the left-front quarter panel of V2 (Event 1). Subsequently, this collision caused V2 to veer right and contact the curbed west median (Event 2) then strike the left side of V3 with its front plane (Event 3). This collision caused V3 to be pushed laterally to the right and strike the left plane of V4 with its right front plane (Event 4). Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 was an 83-year-old female who suffered a bloody nose and airbag burns to her forearms, but wasn't transported. She reported that she was out running errands. She had just left a department store a few blocks away and was heading to the grocery store. She said she negotiated the left curve and got in the left turn lane, which had a solid green light. She saw no opposing cars coming, but says a large van was stopped in the opposing left turn lane and she couldn't see traffic coming behind this van. She did not use her turn signal because she did not see any opposing traffic to signal to. She decelerated and began her left turn. Once she cleared the stopped van, she looked right and saw V2 coming toward her at a high rate of speed. She knew there wasn't enough time to stop and back up, so she accelerated in an attempt to get out of V2's path. She said the driver of V2 steered right to avoid her and they collided near the entrance to the shopping center. The collision caused her car to spin around in the roadway. It was towed with disabling front-end damage.
The driver of V2 was a 43-year-old female who suffered moderate injuries in this crash requiring transport to the hospital. She was a full-time city police officer who was in uniform at the time of crash. She was on her way to a wake at a local funeral home for a family member/retired officer who had recently passed away. She reported that she was in lane two, traveling an estimated 72 kmph (45 mph) when all of a sudden V1 made a left turn across her path. Things became fuzzy for her after that. She thinks she steered right and applied the brakes, but wasn't 100 percent sure because "it happened so fast." She knows that after the first impact, she struck V3, which was stopped at the light. Her vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling damage.
The driver of V3 was a 44-year-old male who was transported from the scene with possible injuries. He was unable to be located for an interview. His vehicle was drivable, but was towed due to airbag deployment.
V3 was not involved in the first harmful event and so no Critical Pre-crash Event and no Critical Reason were coded. This driver suffers from acid reflux disease, treated with prescription medication, according to medical records. He wasn't interviewed so its unknown if there were any other associated factors.
