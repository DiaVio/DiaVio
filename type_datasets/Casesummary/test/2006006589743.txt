This crash occurred just after noon in the eastbound lanes of a divided, high-speed, high-volume expressway. The east/west expressway consisted of two lanes in each direction flanked by paved shoulders and separated by a concrete barrier wall. The bituminous expressway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50 mph). Traffic flow was heavy due to the fact that the crash occurred in a construction zone. There were several work vehicles parked on the right shoulder of the expressway. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2004 International Tow Truck (towing a light vehicle on its flatbed), was eastbound in lane one. V2, a 1993 Toyota Camry, was also eastbound just ahead of V1 in lane two. V3, a 2005 Sterling Dump Truck pulling an arrow board (not in use) was parked on the right shoulder. As V2 changed lanes into lane one and decelerated it was struck in the rear by the front of V1. The force of the impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise until it contacted, with its front, the cement barrier located to the left beyond lane two. V2 continued rotating, and again struck the cement barrier, with its right side, before it came to final rest facing west. After the initial impact, V1 traveled right and contacted the arrow board pulled by V3 on the right shoulder. V1 continued forward and struck the rear of V3. The impact rotated V3 counter-clockwise (where it struck another parked vehicle) until it came to final rest facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 58-year-old male stated he was on his way back to his shop when he looked up from adjusting his two-way radio and saw that V2 had entered his lane. He slammed on the brakes and steered right in an attempt to avoid contacting V2, but it was too late. He subsequently lost control of the vehicle and struck the parked vehicles on the shoulder. The driver of V1 was transported for treatment and the vehicle was towed due to damage.
The driver of V2, a 44-year-old female, said she was traveling east in lane two and needed to get into lane one. Soon after entering lane two, she was struck in the rear by V1 causing to spin and hit the barrier wall. She was transported for treatment and V2 was towed due to damage.
