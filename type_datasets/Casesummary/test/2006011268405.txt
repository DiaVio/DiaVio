The crash occurred on a fully controlled two-way, two lane highway divided by a grassy median. The straight, level, bituminous roads have a posted speed limit of 113 kmh (70 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday, early afternoon crash were daylight, cloudy and dry.
V1, a 2000 Ford Taurus SE 4 door sedan driven by a 57-year old female, was traveling southbound in lane two, on her way home from picking up her 16 year-old son from school. The driver stated that traffic was congested due vehicles merging into lane one from an interchange entrance ramp on the right. The driver eased up on her speed of 113 kmh (70 mph) to allow traffic to settle down. A tractor-trailer was merging on right with a pick-up truck and a line of vehicles following it. The driver stated that she began to accelerate to get back to the speed limit and to get past the semi. V1 was next to the pick-up truck (most likely in it's blind spot-per v1 driver), when the pick-up swerved quickly into lane two to pass the semi. V1 successfully avoided the pick-up (witness vehicle), and swerved to the left onto the paved shoulder. V1 contacted loose gravel on the shoulder so the driver of v1 swerved back right. V1 contacted the rumble strips and rotated clockwise straddling lane one and the shoulder facing back towards traffic. V1 left the roadway on the left into the grassy median, rolled 6-quarter turns, and continued 128 meters. V1 came to rest on the far side of the median on its roof, facing northeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The driver and her 16 year-old son front right passenger, who were both fully restrained, were transported from the scene to a local trauma center due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The witness, the pick-up truck driver stated that he had entered the highway from an entrance ramp on the right, behind a large semi truck, and was traveling approximately 72 kmh (45 mph) in lane one. The witness decided to change lanes to the left, checked his rear view and left mirrors, looked left and thought it was clear. The witness swerved into lane two, cutting off v1, who was apparently in his blind spot.
