This four-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a 3-way intersection. The intersection consisted of a multi-lane highway and an intersecting side street with a properly functioning signal controlling all the traffic. The main thoroughfare is a 2-lane east/west divided highway that includes a left-turn lane at the intersection and the intersecting street is a two-lane divided street. The bituminous roadways are all dry, straight, and flat. The east/west highway has a speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph) and the side street has a speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The weather conditions were clear, sunny and daylight.
V1, a 2001 Dodge Intrepid with one occupant, was westbound intending to turn left at the intersection. V2, a 2000 Volvo tractor with loaded trailer and one occupant, was eastbound intending to go straight through the intersection. V3, a 2006 BMW 325i with one occupant, was stopped in lane 2 facing north at the intersection intending to turn left. V4, a 2003 Acura MDX with three occupants, was stopped in lane 1 facing north at the intersection intending to turn right. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The signal for V1 and V2 was changing from green to yellow as V1 began its left turn maneuver and as V2 was entering the intersection. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1 {event #1} causing V1 to spin clockwise and into the direction of V3. The right side of V1 struck the left side of V3 {event #2) and the debris from this collision splashed onto the left side of V4 {event #3}. V2 continued eastbound and departed the right roadside where its right trailer struck a steel guardrail {event # 4} and came to a stop. The driver of V1 was the only person transported from the scene for injuries.
The driver of V1 is a 25-year-old female that was returning to her office this afternoon after her lunch break when she was involved in this crash. She was in the left-turn only lane behind a trail of other vehicles that were also turning left. When she approached the intersection and crossed the painted stop line, she saw a tractor-trailer coming from the opposite direction. She saw the tractor- trailer "kind of wiggle" as if it was slowing down so she glanced at the traffic signal again and realized it turned yellow so she decided to turn left. After she already committed to the turn, she noticed that the tractor-trailer was not slowing down so she accelerated across the intersection but could not avoid a collision. The right side of her 2001 Intrepid was crushed by the front of the tractor and her vehicle was pushed into another car that was stopped at the intersection. She was transported to a local trauma center where she was treated and released for minor injuries (bruising.)
The driver of V2 is a 31-year-old male and an owner/operator of his trucking company. He said he was driving 72-80 kmph (45- 50 mph) and intended to go straight through the intersection because his signal was green. He said as he approached the intersection he saw oncoming vehicles making left turns and he did not think much about it until he saw V1 try to beat him across the intersection. He said there was no time for him to stop so he crashed into the right side of the Dodge. He is not certain if he applied his brakes before or at the point of impact but he thinks he was probably going 72 kmph (45 mph) at impact. He was not injured in the crash but his truck was damaged enough to be towed.
The driver of V3 is a 42-year-old female that was stopped at this intersection waiting to turn her left, when she saw V1 turn left in front of V2. V2 struck the right side of V1 and pushed it into the left side of her car. She said her traffic signal was red during the entire sequence of events. She was not injured in the crash and her car was driven away.
