The crash occurred on the roadside of a northbound, urban highway. There were three northbound lanes on a divided highway with a grass median and guardrail. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph) and a 5% uphill grade. Conditions were daylight and wet with cloudy skies. The setting was morning hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 1998 Jeep Cherokee sport utility traveling northbound in lane one, preparing to merge onto the highway. V1 lost control and traveled off the right side of the road, impacting a guardrail with the front plane. V1 then rolled left six quarter-turns, coming to rest on its top on the right shoulder. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.
The Jeep Cherokee (v1) was driven by a 20-year old female who was treated on scene for possible injuries. She stated that she had just stayed up all night working on a school project and was headed to the copy store. When she began merging onto the highway, she fishtailed unexpectedly. She steered right in avoidance but lost control and rolled over. She estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 64 kmph (40 mph). The sport utility was towed due to damage.
