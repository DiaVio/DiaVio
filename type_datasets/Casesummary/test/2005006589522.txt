This single vehicle crash began in the middle of a two-way intersection. Both the southbound and eastbound roadways were one-way one-lane roadways. Both were dry and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The intersection was controlled by signalized traffic lights without pedestrian crossing for both directions. The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon on a weekday. There were no adverse weather conditions and traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2001 Mitsubishi Montero, was traveling southbound at an unknown speed when it entered the intersection at the same time as a non-contact vehicle that was traveling east. The driver of V1 reacted by jerking the wheel hard to the left, and then back to the right. The driver of V1 lost control and the vehicle rotated clockwise. V1 then rolled over two one-quarter turns to the left, ending up on its top, sliding a few feet before coming to final rest facing south. V1 had major damage and was towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
The driver of Vehicle 1, a 24-year old male, stated that he was traveling southbound when a vehicle sped in front of him from his right. In order to avoid hitting this vehicle, he sharply turned to his left and rolled over the vehicle onto its top. At the time of the crash, the driver was on leave from the military and was familiar with the intersection. The passenger, his wife, was transported to the hospital with minor injuries, and later refused an interview. The driver of V1 was not injured and has since returned to the military.
