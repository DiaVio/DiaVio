The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a grassy median. There were two lanes in each direction. The roadway was curved to the right. It was dry asphalt with a downhill slope of 4% to the east. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph), the weather was clear on a weekday morning and traffic was moderate.
V1, a 1986 Acura Legend four-door with one occupant was traveling eastbound in lane two. V2, a 2006 Kenworth boom utility truck with no occupants was parked running on the right eastbound shoulder. It was standing on four stabilizer feet while a crew was working nearby. Orange cones had been placed behind it as a precaution. As V1 was eastbound it crossed over a rise in the road. The slope on each side of the rise was approximately 4%. About 26 m east of the crest there was a crossover from a two-lane north-south bound roadway. A four-door sedan with one occupant made a left turn from the crossover into the path of V1. V1 steered to the right and braked with lockup and was able to avoid contact with the turning vehicle. V1 skidded longitudinally about 25 m to the right across lane one and off the right side of the road. V1's front right corner struck the left side of V2 just below the passenger compartment and at the left front stabilizer foot. It came to rest facing southeast at that point. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Acura Legend, was driven by a 28-year old female who reported possible injury and was transported to a hospital. The driver advised that she was traveling about 76 kph (47 mph), while running errands, when she made the evasive action to avoid striking the vehicle that had turned into her path. She was successful in avoiding that impact but was unable to stop before striking V2.
V2, the Kenworth truck, was not a case vehicle since it was not in transport. It was parked 1.3 m south of the right edge of the roadway eastbound.
