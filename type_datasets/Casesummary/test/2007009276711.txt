The crash occurred on a 6-lane roadway divided by a grassy median in an intersection with a 4-lane undivided roadway. On the divided roadway, there were three north and three southbound lanes including left turn-only lanes. In the northbound direction, there was an additional right turn-only lane close to the intersection. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was the mid-evening on a weekday. The roads were dry, it was dark out but the road was illuminated by street lamps and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was light.
V1, a 2006 Honda Civic 4-door, was driven by an 81-year old female. She stated that she had just come back from a store and was on her way home. She was traveling south in lane 3, the left turn lane, making a left turn when the crash occurred. Prior to entering the intersection, she was checking the street sign to see if she was going in the correct direction to head home. She then initiated her left turn without checking to see if it was safe to proceed. She had no time to react once she saw V2, a 2003 Volkswagen GTI coupe, coming toward her in the opposite direction. Although the driver of V2 applied the brakes, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1. Immediately after this impact, V1 rolled over onto its left side and then onto the roof before coming to a rest on its left side (three quarter-turns). The driver of V1 was transported for possible injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, the 2003 Volkswagen GTI, was driven by a 44-year old male. He reported that he was driving home from work, traveling north in lane two when the crash occurred. He said that he had the green light as he entered the intersection when he noticed V1 turning left in front of him. He said he slammed on the brakes but it was already too late. The driver was not injured.
