The crash occurred on a rural secondary arterial road that was oriented north/south, was two-way, two-lane and had a posted speed limit of 64kph (40mph). The roadway was level with a curve left (west) and was super-elevated by 2 percent. The curve radius measured 322meters at its apex. The lanes measured 3 meters each with no shoulders present. The right (east) side of the road was bordered by first a slight ditch and then an embankment that measured positive 12.5% at both roll initiation and final rest. The embankment had a fence to its east separating it from the residential neighborhood on the other side of it.
Vehicle #1 was a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer traveling north on the road and was halfway through the curve when it departed the right (east) side of the road. It then rotated clockwise and rolled 1 complete turn to land upright and finally came to rest facing southeast with its left front corner against the fence. Vehicle #1 was towed from the crash scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Vehicle #1, was driven by an eighteen year old unrestrained female who did not remember the crash events. She was transported from the crash scene to a local trauma center for treatment of injuries. The last thing she recalled immediately before the crash was inserting a CD into the player and turning it up very loud. She had been driving for over four hours that day (cumulative) and was in the last leg of her trip to move home from school.
