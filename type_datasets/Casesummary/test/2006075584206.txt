This single-vehicle crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a six-lane roadway divided by a sod-depressed median. There were three lanes in each direction. This was a right curve, downhill, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 105 kph (65 mph). It was early morning on a weekend and the road was icy and slushy, and it was snowing. Traffic flow was moderate with traffic heading up the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer four-door with three occupants, was westbound in lane one. V1 was negotiating a right curve and traveling the speed limit of 105 kph (65 mph). The vehicle ran off the right side before the driver steered right and the vehicle re-entered the roadway. The vehicle crossed the traffic lanes as the driver over corrected and the vehicle initiated a clockwise yaw and departed the left road edge. V1 continued in the clockwise yaw down a depressed grassy median and rolled over four quarter turns coming to rest on its wheels facing north in the median. The vehicle was towed due to damage. None of the occupants were transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
A 17 year-old female drove V1, the 1998 Mercury Mountaineer. She had picked up the passengers and they were heading for a day of snowboarding. Just prior to the crash, the driver stated she was talking to the right frontal passenger, telling him she was going to stop and let him drive since the roads were getting worst. She stated she ran off the right side of the road, hit a sign, slid across the road, ran off the left side and then rolled one time. There was no physical evidence that the vehicle hit a sign, however, debris in the front right rim/tire indicates the vehicle ran off the right road edge, returned to the roadway and then off the left road edge. The driver overcompensated when the vehicle initially ran off the roadway and the vehicle ran off the left road edge.
