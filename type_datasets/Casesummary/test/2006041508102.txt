This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekend in the southbound lanes of a high-volume, high-speed interstate. The southbound lanes consisted of six-lanes (with lane six serving as an HOV lane) flanked by paved shoulders and concrete barrier walls. The bituminous highway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed of 105kmph (65 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1995 Ford Mustang, was southbound in lane six (the HOV lane). V2, a 2004 Lexus RX300, was traveling southbound in lane two slightly ahead of V1. V1 began a series of apparent lane changes, into the side of V2. The right side of V1 made contact with the left side of V2. After impact, V2 veered west toward the right barrier wall. The front of V2 made contact with the concrete wall. V2 then continued southbound in the emergency shoulder, scraping the right rear wheel well against the barrier wall before coming to final rest. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise toward the left barrier wall after initial impact with V2. The right side of V1 hit the concrete barrier and V1 came to final rest facing north on the shoulder. V2 came to final rest on the inside emergency shoulder, facing south. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 29-year-old male, refused treatment. After numerous attempts this researcher was unable to locate the driver of V1 making an interview unobtainable. Therefore it is unknown why he crossed over so many lanes.
The driver of V2, a 35-year old male, also refused treatment. He said that he and his family were on their way to pick up their son at the driver's parent's house. He stated he was in lane two when seemingly out of nowhere; the driver of V1 hit the left side of his SUV. The driver stated that he didn't see the other driver coming, because the other driver must have been slightly staggered behind him. Therefore he did not take any avoidance actions. The driver did not know whether the impact forced him into the wall, or if he jerked the wheel to the right as a reaction to getting hit on the left side.
