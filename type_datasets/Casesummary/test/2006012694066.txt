This crash occurred in the afternoon of weekday on the eastern roadside of the southbound lanes of an interstate highway. The highway is composed of 3 northbound and 3 southbound lanes divided by a grass median with a posted speed limit of 113kmph (70 mph). The bituminous southbound lanes were level and curved to the right they also featured paved shoulders with rumble strips. The traffic flow was normal despite a quick but heavy rain shower soaking the road at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1993 Ford Probe, was southbound in lane three negotiating the curve. As V1 continued around the curve the rear of the vehicle started to rotate clockwise. V1 crossed in front of a semi that was traveling in lane two, across lane one and onto the shoulder where it struck a reflector. V1 then traveled another 16.5 meters before tripping on the soft ground and rolling over 1 complete turn and coming to final rest in a swampy area of the roadside. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by an 18 year-old female who was on her way to visit her father. She was not wearing her prescription lenses that correct a myopic (near-sighted) condition. She stated that the rear sway bar was broken weeks before the crash and she could feel a difference in the vehicle's handling. She stated as the vehicle started to rotate, she attempted to counter-steer but this did not help. She stated that she looked to her right to see a semi truck next to her and all she could think of is that her vehicle was going to travel under the rear trailer of the truck. She then panicked and let go of the steering wheel traveling off the roadway and rolling over into a swamp area. The driver was uninjured but V1 was towed due to damage.
The witness (driver of the semi) was traveling south in lane two of the highway. He saw V1 enter the highway from another roadway that runs through the city. He stated that a heavy rain was falling as the vehicles negotiated a curve. He watched V1 begin to rotate clockwise, slid off the right side of the roadway and rollover.
