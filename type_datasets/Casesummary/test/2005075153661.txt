A single-vehicle crash occurred early evening on a straight, dry, asphalt downhill, divided, six-lane, U.S. highway within an interchange. The highway generally runs north/south, but runs east/west at the location of the crash. There are three southbound lanes that consist of a right turn lane and two through lanes. On the north side of the street is a grassy shoulder with a 33% uphill embankment. There are no traffic controls present. The speed limit on the highway is 105 kph (65 mph) and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time.
Vehicle one, a 1995 Jeep Wrangler 4x4 SE, driven by a 36 year-old female had just entered the interchange area traveling southbound in lane one adjacent to the right shoulder. The driver of vehicle one was reaching for a hamburger. She speculated that she accidentally put the gearshift in reverse as she was doing this. The rear wheels locked up and vehicle one began to skid. Vehicle one rotated clockwise and with steering input it departed the roadway to the paved shoulder. The paved shoulder turned into a soft dirt shoulder. The left side tires dug into the soft shoulder and caused the vehicle to roll to its left side. It rolled five quarter turns and then came to rest on its left side facing northeast on the uphill embankment. Vehicle one was towed due to moderate right side damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
The pre-event movement for vehicle one coded going straight, category this vehicle control loss due to non-disabling vehicle problem (driver inadvertently shifted into reverse while reaching for food), Critical reason for the critical event driver related factor "internal distraction".
Associative factors, driver was late for meeting and was rushing to get there, large profile tires, raised suspension. Presence of Vicodin and Levothroid.
