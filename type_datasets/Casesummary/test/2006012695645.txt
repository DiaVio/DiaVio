This crash occurred on a straight hilly north/south roadway that had a lot of open fields on both sides of the road. This crash occurred at the beginning of the week in the early evening hours just after dark. The roadway had no lighting in this area. The roadway was asphalt and was level on the northbound side of the roadway. At impact, the road was also level. On the southbound side, the pre-impact roadway was an uphill slope of 4 percent. The speed was posted at 89 kmph (55mph). The southbound roadway at the pre-crash area was dry. The northbound side at pre-impact was snow-covered and icy due to blowing snow from the open field on the side of the road.
Vehicle #1, a 2004 Dodge Dakota pickup, was driven by a 67-year old male. He was traveling north on the roadway when he drove onto a patch of snow/ice. The driver lost control and the vehicle rotated clockwise and started to slide off the roadway. The driver counter-steered and the vehicle then began to rotate counterclockwise. The vehicle then slid across the centerline where its right front side was struck by Vehicle #2, a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado pickup. V2 was driven by a 54-year old male who was on his way to work. He had just crested the hill when he saw V1 sliding out of control. He decelerated and steered to the right; however, he could not avoid striking V1. Following this impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side of V1 side-slapped the left side of V2. This impact sent V2 into a counterclockwise rotation and it slid off the road and its right side then struck a mailbox post before coming to final rest on the west side of the road. V1 came to final rest at a 45-degree angle in the center of the roadway. The driver and the occupant of V1 were transported to a local trauma unit in critical condition. The driver of V2 was checked over by the EMS personnel but refused to go to the ER. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 was not interviewed due to his injuries; however, his wife, who was the front right seat passenger was interviewed instead. She reported that the two of them had been on their way to watch their grandchild in karate class. She stated that as they traveled north on the roadway, they came to an area that had snow blowing across the road. She stated that there must have been some black ice because the vehicle started to rotate clockwise and slide off the right side of the road. She stated that her husband got the vehicle back in control a little ways but then it rotated the other way and then crossed the centerline where they were hit by the southbound vehicle. She stated that she was unconscious from there on. She reported that the driver was in fair health - he had had bouts of cancer, kidney problems, heart problems, diabetes and depression. He takes medications for all his medical problems.
The driver of V2 reported that he was in good health and only wears corrective lenses for reading. He stated he was on his way to work when the crash occurred. He had just crested a hilltop and noted the northbound vehicle out of control. He stated that he started to slow his vehicle and steered to the right but the other vehicle came across the centerline so fast that there was nothing he could do to avoid the vehicle. He stated that he did not remember much after that till they came to final rest. He stated that his driver's door was jammed shut and he could not find his cell phone to call 911. He stated he slid across the seat to get out the passenger side door. After he got out, it was cold so he went to open the door but the door handle was gone. The witnesses came to help him and stay with him until the police and EMS arrived.
The witnesses to this crash were both traveling northbound behind V1 when the crash occurred. They both thought that after V1 rotated clockwise, the driver was going to recover from his rotation but then the vehicle rotated counterclockwise across the centerline. Both witnesses stopped after the crash and assisted the drivers before EMS arrival.
