This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early evening hours on a weekday in the middle of a T-intersection. It should be noted that although there were traffic lights for all four directions of travel, the north end of the intersection led to a business and was not a throughway. The east/west roadway, upon which the crash occurred, consisted of four lanes on the east end, and five lanes on the west end. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level. The posted speed limit was 72kmph (45mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Saturn station wagon, was heading west in lane two intending to make a left at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Toyota Camry, was heading east in lane two intending to continue straight through the intersection. As V1 attempted to make the turn, the front of the vehicle contacted the left front of V2. Vehicle one rotated counterclockwise approximately 240 degrees before coming to final rest facing north in the middle of the intersection. Vehicle two deflected to the right a bit and continued forward. It traveled over an island dividing traffic on the south side of the intersection. It continued onto a grassy area, where it struck two street signs. The vehicle ultimately came to final rest off the right side of the roadway facing east. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 71 year-old female, suffered from neck and back pain and was taken to a medical facility for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle. She did not remember seeing the other vehicle approaching when she attempted to make the left turn, and seemed to have a hard time recollecting much of the incident itself. She said that she was in good health, although she suffers from a thyroid condition as well as diabetes, and takes medication accordingly. She was not fatigued at the time of the crash and did not participate in any strenuous physical or recreational activities. She relayed that she was very comfortable with her vehicle, although she rarely drove on this roadway. No mechanical factors contributed to this crash.
The driver of V2, a 39 year-old female, suffered from chest and neck pain and was taken to a medical facility for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle. She related that she was driving along in lane two, and was planning on continuing straight through the intersection. At the very last possible instant she noticed V1 turning across her travel path. She was not entirely certain, but believed that she attempted to brake; however, there was not enough room. She relayed that she was in good health, with the exception of a thyroid condition and was taking the appropriate medication along with birth control. She stated that she was not fatigued and that she was very familiar with the area. No contributing mechanical factors were associated with this crash.
