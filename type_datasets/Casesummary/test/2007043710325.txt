This two-vehicle crash occurred where an interstate off-ramp intersects with a major north/south roadway. This interchange is controlled by an overhead traffic control signal. All roadways contained paved shoulders. There are four northbound lanes and four southbound lanes divided by a grass median. Northbound approach is straight, level and bituminous. Westbound off-ramp curves left with a +5% super-elevation and has a -2.5% downhill profile. It consists of three lanes; two left turns lanes and a right turn lane. The posted speed limit for the main road is 88 kph (55 mph), while the off-ramp speed limit is 104 kph (65 mph). Setting was afternoon hours on a weekday. Conditions were daylight, clear and dry with light traffic.
Vehicle 1 was a 1999 Toyota Camry, four-door intermediate with one occupant, traveling northbound in lane two. Vehicle 2 was a 2002 Buick LeSabre, four-door full size with one occupant, traveling westbound in lane two. A witness/ non-contact vehicle was traveling westbound in lane three, to the left of V2, driving a large white box truck. When the westbound traffic light changed to green, The NCV and V2 proceeded into the intersection. The NCV looked left and noticed VI was proceeding through the intersection. The NCV stopped to avoid a collision, but V2 was unable to see VI because the NCV was to the left of it. The front of V2 contacted the right-front of VI in the intersection. After impact, VI rotated clockwise, traveled 19 meters (62 feet) and came to rest at the northeast corner of the interchange. After impact V2 deflected to the left and drove to the left shoulder of the northbound lanes appoxiamtely 60 meters (197 feet) from the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
The driver of VI was a 69 year-old semi-retired, female who was transported from the scene with chest pain. She works as an as needed care-giver, working no more than 20 hours per week. On the day of the crash she had just come from visiting her sick sister, who had just been admitted to the hospital. She had left the hospital and made a quick stop at the post office before heading to her sister's house to pick up her mail. She was driving in lane two because she had to make a right at the end of the road. She says she looked down inside of her car for a second (she couldn't recall what she was looking for), then she looked up and the street light was red. She said it was really sunny and hard to see the light and that the light had been recently installed a month ago, and she wasn't used to it being there yet. As she proceeded through the red light, all of a sudden she saw the top of V2 as it struck her right side. After impact she drove her car to the left shoulder and call 911. Her vehicle did not suffer disabling damage.
The driver of V2 was a 60 year-old disabled female who suffered minor injuries and refused transport. She reported being on the road for less than 10 minutes. She was coming from her son's house, to pick-up her grand-children (as she does daily) from their school. She was stopped at the red light in lane two with a white box truck next to her in lane three. Her light changed to green, so she proceeded to accelerate into the intersection. The white truck blocked her view of traffic coming from the left, but she assumed northbound traffic would yield the right of way to her. She then heard a loud noise and saw her hood fly toward her windshield. Her vehicle rotated clockwise and came to final rest near the shoulder. She claims to have never seen V1. After impact she saw V1 travel to the left shoulder and stop. She thought V1 was going to flee the scene. Her vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage.
*The driver of the large box truck in lane three, to the left of V2, was interviewed on-scene as an eyewitness. He told me himself and V2 had been first in line at the red light in the two left turn lanes. The light had been red for approximately 30 seconds. He said the light changed to green and he started to proceed, but noticed V1 was traveling fast and obviously not going to stop. He was able to stop and avoid a collision, but said V2 couldn't see V1 because his vehicle blocked her vision. V2 continued and struck the right side of V1 in the intersection. V1 traveled to the left side of the road and came to final rest. He also said that of the four northbound lanes, V1 was the only vehicle on the road at the time, making it easy for him to see that she wasn't stopping.
