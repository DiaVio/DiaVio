The crash involving one vehicle happened late afternoon during daylight hours. The location was a three-lane, divided (positive barrier, six lanes overall), downhill concrete highway. The weather was clear but the roads were wet and the overpasses and bridges iced. The entire study area experienced a rainfall with freezing the entire weekend. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 97 kmph (60 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Isuzu Rodeo driven by a 26 year-old female with three passengers, was traveling southbound in the third lane of the roadway. This lane was a designated HOV lane. It was separated from lane two by a rumble strip. While passing over an icy bridge, V1 lost control. It caused the vehicle to depart the road to its right. Its right side impacted the western wall of the bridge. V1 sideswiped along the bridge. At the end of the bridge, the driver over corrected in an attempt to steer the vehicle to the left. The vehicle rotated counter-clockwise before it rolled over onto its right side. V1 slid south bound while on its right side. It came to rest on its right side, 65 meters (213 feet) south of the end of the bridge facing east. V1 was partially in lane 1 and partially in lane 2. V1 was towed from the scene. The driver and the other three occupants, including two children restrained in child seats, were transported to local medical facility. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
