This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of the block in the northbound lane of a two-lane, one southbound and one northbound non-physically divided roadway, only double yellow lines separated the two-way roadway. There were wide shoulder areas on both the right and left sides of these traffic-ways that were used for parking and bus/public transportation travel lanes. There were no traffic control devices at this middle of the block location. The asphalt roadways were level, straight, and there were no adverse weather conditions. The speed limit for both directions was 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday during the mid afternoon daylight hours. The roadway was free of any defects and the traffic flow was normal for this roadway.
Vehicle one, 1993 Ford Aerostar Minivan, was traveling southbound on the two-way roadway when it crossed over the double yellow lines onto the northbound opposing traffic lane and contacted head-on vehicle two, a 1994 Mercury Grand Marquis, traveling northbound already occupying northbound lane one. After the initial impact, vehicle one traveled a few feet rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest facing southward. Vehicle two, after the initial impact, was pushed backwards a couple feet where it came to final rest continuing to face northward. Vehicle one's damages were disabling and it was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of vehicle one, a 42-year old female, said she was traveling southbound when she realized her brakes were not functioning. So she panicked steered left and then right and began pumping her brakes however nothing happened. She tried using her parking brakes and there too nothing happened, the vehicle just wouldn't stop. She looked up and saw she'd crossed over into the opposing northbound travel lane. She saw vehicle two traveling slowly but couldn't do anything to prevent the imminent crash with vehicle two, it was too late to do anything. Her vehicle struck vehicle two head-on and she was able to exit her vehicle on her own, she said. She was not injured. The police and researcher were able to verify that the vehicles brakes were dysfunctional.
The driver of vehicle two, a 55-year old male, said he was traveling northbound slowly on his way home from work on his normal route. He travels on this roadway daily. The traffic is always busy this time of day, he said. He noticed vehicle one traveling southbound swerving left and right and thought she'd pull it together. He observed V1 crossing over into his lane heading directly towards him. At this point, he said, vehicle one did the inevitable crash into his vehicle and there was nothing he could do but hold on to the steering wheel. It all happened so fast and over just as quickly, he said. He was transported to the hospital with complaints of pain.
