This three-vehicle crash occurred on a freeway during early morning hours. The road is a 4-lane divided (with positive barrier) up hill asphalt roadway from east to west. The speed limit for the roadway is 104 kmph (65 mph). The road surface was dry and there were no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. There was steady morning traffic on the roadways. The rush hour had not yet started. The crash sequence occurred on a bridge over a river.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Honda Civic with two occupants, was traveling west in the second lane of traffic. Vehicle three (V3), a 1996 Ford Ranger with one occupant, was traveling west in lane four of the highway. Vehicle two (V2) an unidentified medium/heavy dump truck was traveling west in lane three. V2 attempted to change into lane 2. The right side of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 started to rotate counter clockwise, crossed lane three and four. The front of V1 impacted the concrete median rail of the bridge with its front left V1 bounced off the rail and continued to move west while rotating counter clockwise. The front of V3 impacted the left side of V1. V1 moved further west and its right side sideswiped along the bridge rail until the vehicle came to rest, facing east. V3 continued to drive west and stopped on the south shoulder of the highway. V2 did not stop and continued to drive west after the initial crash. V1 was towed from the scene. The driver of V3 drove the vehicle from the scene with the intent to exit the highway and park the vehicle there. He abandoned the vehicle later on the shoulder of the highway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A 34-year old male drove V1. He was heading from his residence to work. He was not conversing with his passenger and was not using a cell phone. He stated he was traveling within the speed limit when he got hit into the driver's side and started to rotate. The driver used an exaggeration by saying he made "18 donuts" (complete turns) before he impacted the bridge wall. He only heard from witnesses at the scene that a large truck had impacted him. The driver was not willing to answer any detailed questions during the phone interview. The address shown on his driver's license is not his current residence. The exact time and distance he traveled to the crash site could not be determined.
The driver of V2 was not identified. V2 was described as a white dump truck. Several witnesses stated V2 crossed the lane line and struck V1.
A 47-year old male drove V3. He was heading to work from home. He does not take any medication and is in good heath. He rarely drives on the roadway. He stated he was in the fourth lane, traveling at a normal rate of speed. He observed an unidentified medium /heavy truck cutting into lane two ahead of V1. In his observation, the heavy truck struck V1, causing it to loose control. The truck continued to drive without stopping after the crash.
