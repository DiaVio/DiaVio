The crash occurred at the intersection of an interchange in the northbound lanes of a four-lane, urban highway with a grass median. There were four northbound lanes and four southbound lanes. An offramp from another highway intersected the road with three westbound lanes. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph). The northbound lanes were on a downhill grade of 3%, while the westbound lanes were on level ground and included a left curve. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was early afternoon hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 2000 Honda Civic sedan traveling north in lane four. Vehicle two was a 2007 Chrysler Town & Country minivan traveling west in lane three preparing to turn left. Both vehicles proceeded through the intersection. The front of V1 impacted the left plane of V2. Both vehicles continued a short distance; V1 coming to rest in the northbound paved shoulder and V2 coming to rest in the grass median off the southbound lanes of travel. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
The Honda Civic (V1) was driven by a 43-year old male who was treated on scene with non-incapacitating injuries. He stated that he was heading home from the mall. He approached an intersection and then can only remember his airbag going off. He did not have any avoidance actions to the crash, and estimates his travel speed at 88 kmph (55 mph). The Honda sedan was towed due to damage.
The Chrysler Town & Country (V2) was driven by a 46-year old male who was uninjured. He stated that he was killing some time before his flight out of town and decided to head over to a nearby mall. He approached an intersection at the bottom of an offramp and decelerated before beginning his left turn. He saw V1 was about to run the light so he accelerated in avoidance. He estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 16 kmph (10 mph). The Chrysler minivan continued in service after the crash.
