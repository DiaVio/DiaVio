This two-vehicle crash occurred on a weekday during early evening rush hour on a north/southbound interstate that had a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). This interstate varied in both its road surface type (concrete and asphalt), as well as its number of travel lanes. Both V1 and V2 were traveling northbound on a portion of this interstate that had 4 travel lanes, was level, and had an asphalt surface. Though the roadway curved to the left just ahead of where the crash took place, the pre-crash portion of the roadway was straight.
V1, a 2004 Mercedes C230 driven by a 64-year old male, had just traveled across a bridge and entered this north/southbound interstate traveling northbound. A partial interview was obtained from the driver's spouse. She stated that her husband lost consciousness at some point as he crossed the bridge and didn't remember any of the crash details. As V1 entered the 4-lane northbound interstate, it drifted across 3 lanes of northbound travel and struck a concrete barrier with its front left side. Upon this impact the vehicle was redirected back across the 4 northbound travel lanes where it then struck the concrete barrier on the other side of the roadway with its front right side. V1 was again redirected back into the northbound traffic lanes where its left front side struck the right side cab of V2, rotated clockwise, and its left rear was then struck and partially run over by the right rear tire of V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2000 GMC refrigerated straight truck with a GVWR of 25,500 lbs, was driving northbound in lane 2. The driver of this vehicle, a 30-year old male, could not be reached for an interview and so a partial surrogate interview was obtained from the driver's employer. He stated that his employee was driving northbound in lane 2 when he heard the sounds of V1 impacting the concrete barriers behind him. He also explained that his employee said that it all happened so fast that there was nothing that he could do to avoid being struck.
No Critical Pre-Crash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to V2 because it was not involved in the first harmful event. No associated factors were coded to this driver.
A medical unit was dispatched and the driver of V1 was transported directly to an emergency room where he underwent a full physical exam. The driver of V2 did not receive any injuries. Both V1 and V2 had to be towed from the scene due to damage sustained in this crash.
