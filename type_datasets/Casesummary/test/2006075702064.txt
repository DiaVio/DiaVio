This two-vehicle crash occurred at a four-way, traffic signal-controlled intersection. The north-south roadway is divided by a curbed median and consists of a right turn lane, two through lanes, and two left turn lanes in each direction. This roadway is straight and downhill going southbound, with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday. The roads were wet because of snow, but there was no accumulation on the roadway.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Cadillac Deville, was southbound in lane two approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Buick Park Avenue, was stopped behind two non-contact vehicles at the intersection, southbound in lane two. The front of V1 struck the back of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest near the point of impact in their original travel lane. V1 was towed due to moderate front-end damage. V2 had only minor rear-end damage and was not towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a twenty-four-year-old male, was the only occupant; he was driving from school to visit his son. He was well rested, very comfortable with his car, and drives this route daily. He said that was distracted by plugging his cell phone charger into the adapter just prior to the collision. He was just starting to get a cold, and has had kidney stones and ear infections in the past, but none of these conditions have any effect on his driving. He takes no medications.
The driver of V2, a seventy-seven-year-old male, was the only occupant. He was driving from a health club to his home. He was well rested, very familiar with his car, and drives this roadway every day. He takes vitamins, aspirin, and a cholesterol pill, the name of which he didn't know.
