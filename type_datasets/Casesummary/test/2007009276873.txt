V2 was traveling in lane 2, decelerating for the red light as it came to the intersection. As he was slowing down, the driver looked in his rear view mirror and saw V1 coming towards him at a fast rate of speed. The driver attempted to move over into lane 3 to avoid being struck by V1 but was unsuccessful. V1 struck V2 in the right rear. V2 was pushed over into the far left lane and came to rest partially in the intersection. The driver said he felt the strike from behind and was pushed forward. He said he then saw V1 rolling towards the intersection.
