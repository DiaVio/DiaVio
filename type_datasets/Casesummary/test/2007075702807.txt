This five-vehicle crash occurred on an urban state highway approximately 300 meters (984 feet) north of a four-way, traffic signal-controlled intersection. This six-lane, two-way, roadway is undivided. The southbound traffic lanes consist of two through lanes and a left-turn lane. This roadway is straight and level, with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). This crash occurred mid- afternoon on a weekday. Traffic flow was heavy in this typically congested area.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Jeep Cherokee 4 x 4 SUV with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Hyundai Sonata sedan with two occupants, was southbound in lane two slowing for traffic stopped at the intersection. Vehicle three (V3), a 2007 Volvo S40 sedan with one occupant, was stopped behind Vehicle four (V4), a 2001 GMC Yukon SUV with three occupants. Vehicle five (V5), a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta sedan with two occupants was the lead vehicle for which V4 was stopped behind. V5, V4 and V3 occupied lane two and were stopped for the traffic signal at the intersection. V2 was decelerating for the forward stopped traffic when the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. This started a "chain reaction" collision and V2's front impacted the back of V3. In turn, V3 impacted the back of V4 with its front and V4 impacted the back of V5 with its front. V1, V2, and V3 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1 and 80 kmph for V2.
Very little is known about the factors for V1's driver because no interview was obtained for the driver of V1, a forty-year-old female. A false address and disconnected phone number were listed on the police report. Additionally, the driver separated from her employment within twenty-four hours after the crash. The investigating officer listed that she was distracted in his report as the most contributing factor for the crash, but did not specify what the distraction was. The investigating officer indicated the speed of V1 at the time of the crash to be 80 kmph (50 mph), which was 16 kmph (10 mph) above the posted speed limit. Physical evidence at the scene shows the driver of V1 applied brakes with lock-up before impact, so at some point in time the driver realized V2 was decelerating, but was unable to stop in time to avoid the impact. The pre-impact V1 skid marks were a measured length of 6.71 meters (22 feet), and indicate the ABS brakes did not activate.
Little is known about the driver of V2, a thirty-four-year-old male due to lack of interview. Repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact this driver were made by the researcher. The investigating officer indicated that V2 was traveling at a speed of 3 kmph (2 mph) when impacted, so they were not fully stopped when the impact occurred.
The driver of V3, a thirty-three-year-old female, was driving from one job appointment to another job appointment. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle, in good health, and drives this route weekly. She is near-sighted, but was not wearing her glasses at the time of the crash and stated that this isn't even a restriction on her license. She said she only wears her glasses at night. She does suffer from migraine headaches and takes the medications: Maxalt, Advil and Aleve.
