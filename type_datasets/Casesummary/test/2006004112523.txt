This crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a 4-lane roadway divided by a concrete median barrier. There were two westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes. This bituminous roadway was straight, level, and wet (due to on and off rainfall all day) with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). This crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday at the start of lunchtime rush hour. The skies were cloudy; rain was off and on and rather light. The traffic flow was moderately congested with stop and go activity.
V1, a 2005 Ford F-150 pickup truck with a single occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one. V2, a 1994 Nissan Sentra 4-door with a single occupant, had just turned out of a shopping center onto the roadway heading eastbound in lane one. V3, a 2004 Hyundai Sonata 4-door with a single occupant, was entering the roadway from the same shopping center heading eastbound in lane one. V2 was following V3 and when both V2 and V3 entered the roadway, V1 was directly behind V2. V3 began to slow down as it came closer to a nearby jug handle entrance. V2 slowed down as well. V1 did not slow down in time and struck the right rear of V2 causing V2 to spin counterclockwise. While rotating, the left rear of V2 struck the left rear of V3. All the vehicles came to final rest in lane 1 near their point of final impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 24-year-old male who reported "C" injuries and refused medical treatment on scene. The driver was on his way home from a nearby construction job. The driver was traveling approximately 48-64 kmph (30-40 mph) when he attempted to avoid the collision with V2 by steering right. When the vehicles in front of V1 slowed down to change lanes, the driver of V1 was looking down at directions and adjusting the radio. When the driver looked forward again, he realized that the cars in front of him were slowing down. He veered to the right to try and avoid the collision with V2; however, he did not have enough time to avoid the collision. The driver said that after he saw the results of the accident he got scared and panicked because he was in his work car and had left work early. The driver ran out of his car and pretended to be injured in order to get out of trouble with the police and his employer.
V2 was driven by a 63-year-old female who reported "C" injuries and refused medical treatment on scene. The driver was traveling in front of V1 and was following the driver of V3 to the doctor's office. V2 and V3 were friends that were running errands together in separate cars. Both V2 and V3 were finishing up at the local shopping center and heading to a doctor's appointment in which they had plenty of time to get there. Both vehicles turned out of the shopping center and made a right onto the roadway. V2 was slowing down in order to switch lanes and as she was decelerating, she felt a hit from behind which caused her vehicle to spin and her left rear to hit the left rear of V3.
V3 was driven by a 78-year-old female who reported no injuries. The driver was on the way to a doctor appointment. She was heading east on the roadway and was slowing down to switch lanes to enter the jug handle up ahead. All of a sudden she felt a hit from behind and looked back and saw that V2's rear had hit her left rear.
V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, no Critical Pre-crash Event or Reason was coded to the driver. The only associated factors coded to the driver were the use of prescription medication to control high blood pressure, the roadway congestion, and the weather.
