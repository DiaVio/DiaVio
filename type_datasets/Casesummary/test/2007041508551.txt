Case #2007-055
The crash occurred at a three-legged intersection. The east/west roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street without any traffic controls. The north/south roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street controlled by a stop sign. These were straight, level, asphalt roads, with posted speeds of 48 kmph (30 mph) in all directions. Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, an unknown light passenger vehicle, was traveling eastbound in lane one. V2, a 1998 Dodge Neon with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2. The front of V1 made contact with the left side of V2. V2 rotated in a counterclockwise direction as it traveled off the roadway of the northwest corner of the intersection. V2's right side made contact with a stop sign, before coming to final rest. V1, having moderate front-end damage, drove away from the crash scene.
V2, the Dodge Neon, was driven by a 51-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he had just left his house to take his girlfriend home. The driver indicated that as he approached the intersection, he could see the other vehicle slowing down as if it was going to turn. The other vehicle hesitated, leading the driver to believe that V1 was going to yield the right-of-way. Suddenly and without warning, V1 initiated the left turn. The driver of V2 said that he swerved to the right to avoid the other car, but was struck on the driver's side door area.
