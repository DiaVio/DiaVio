This two-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday at the intersection of a multi-lane roadway and an entrance/exit to a shopping center. The intersection consists of a two-lane divided roadway with an intersecting two-lane undivided driveway. The main thoroughfare is an east/west city street with a grass median dividing the directions. The roadway is flat, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The intersecting driveway is a north/south 2-lane road without a posted speed limit or a posted stop sign. The conditions were daylight, clear, dry and the traffic level was low.
V1, a 2004 Toyota Highlander 4x4 with one occupant, was southbound on the driveway where it intended to turn left. V2, 1988 Volvo 740 GLE with one occupant, was westbound in lane two where it intended to go straight. A city-owned commuter bus was westbound in lane one where it intended to turn right (north) into the driveway. As the bus turned into the driveway, V1 pulled into the intersection where it was struck in the left side by V2 (event #1). Following the first impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and rolled onto its right side. V2 left approximately 9 meters of skid marks on the road, indicating the driver saw V1 cross his path and he tried to avoid a collision. Both vehicles were towed from the scene and both drivers were transported to a trauma center for minor injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 13 kmph for V1 and 13 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 49-year-old female who was on her lunch break when she was involved in this crash. She reported that she was stopped at this intersection for "a minute or two" while a transit bus to her left loaded and unloaded its passengers. She intended to turn left but the bus was blocking her view of traffic so she remained in place until the bus began to move forward. The bus tried to make a right turn into the same parking lot this driver was trying to exit, but the bus made such a wide turn that it could not make the turn without this driver having to get out of the way. This driver slowly moved forward and began to make her left turn when she was struck in the left side by a V2.
The driver of V2 is a 40-year-old male who works as a mechanic at a Volvo dealership. He reported he was servicing a 1988 Volvo 740 that was brought into the dealership that morning for general maintenance and after working on the vehicle, he took it for a final test drive around the block. He reported he was driving west in lane two and after passing a bus that was stopped in lane one, V1 "popped out" in front of him and stopped in the road. He said he slammed on the brakes (locked-up, no ABS) but that there was no time to avoid a crash.
