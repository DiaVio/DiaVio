A quarter mile previous to the crash V1, a 2005 Cadillac CTS with two occupants, and V2, a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible, were traveling side-by-side in the northbound lanes of a three-lane roadway when the two northbound lanes merged to a single northbound lane. As the lanes merged V1 crossed the double yellow into on coming traffic and V2 took position in the northbound travel lane. The two vehicles continued northbound for approximately a quarter mile until they rounded a curve. At this point an unknown vehicle was traveling southbound, V1 attempted to re-enter the northbound lane bumping V2, causing V2 to spin clockwise. V2 then impacted a mailbox and tree on the driver's door before coming to rest. No avoidance maneuvers were attempted. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 17-year-old male who reported no injuries and occupied by a 17-year-old female that reported a complaint of pain. The female occupant was transported to the hospital. The driver stated that he was taking his girlfriend home and as the two northbound lanes merged, V2 would not allow him to enter the single northbound lane. He then entered the southbound lane and continued to try to pass V2. As they rounded the corner he saw another vehicle in his lane traveling south. He then attempted to re-enter the northbound travel lane and bumped V2. V1 continued to a nearby parking lot and pulled over.
V2 was driven by a 22-year-old female and occupied by a 22-year-old male. Both occupants were transported to the hospital for treatment. No statement was obtained from Driver of V2.
