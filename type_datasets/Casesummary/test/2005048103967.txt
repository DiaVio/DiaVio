This two-vehicle crash occurred mid-afternoon on a straight, dry, downhill, bituminous, six-lane (three lanes in each travel direction), median divided roadway. The median was a raised concrete curb. This roadway runs east/west. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. The speed limit is 72 kmph (45 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Honda Accord was exiting a restaurant parking lot and entering the eastbound side of the roadway. The driver's intention was to cross all three eastbound lanes and turn around at the next intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Toyota Camry, was traveling eastbound in lane three. As V1 made its lane change, the left side of V1 contacted the right side of V2. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the crash by braking. Post impact, V2 contacted the raised median and rolled over. V2 rolled 2-quarter turns longitudinally towards the right and slid on its roof to final rest in the westbound lane of traffic. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
