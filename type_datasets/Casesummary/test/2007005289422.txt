This two-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a weekday in the middle of a four-way intersection. All four directions of the intersection were composed of two lanes, one in each direction. The north/south bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The east/west roadway was level but was curved to the right and had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The north/south roadway was controlled by stop signs; the east/west roadway had no traffic control device. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Taurus 4-door sedan, was heading north on the roadway approaching the intersection, which was controlled by a stop sign. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford F250 large pickup, was heading west on the roadway intending to continue straight through the intersection. The front of V2 contacted the right front of V1. After the impact both vehicles struck again in a side slap - V1's right rear struck the middle left of V2. V1 then continued westbound before coming to final rest of the right side of the road in a strip of bushes. Vehicle two began to rotate clockwise and struck the curb on the northwest corner of the intersection. The left wheels caught on the curb, which resulted in the vehicle rolling over onto its roof on top of a row of bushes. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage.
