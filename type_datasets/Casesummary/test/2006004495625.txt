This crash occurred just after noon on a weekday in the center of a residential "T" intersection. The intersection was composed of a four-lane east/west roadway (2 lanes in each direction), and a two-lane north/southbound roadway. All roadways were bituminous, straight, and level. The east/west roadway had a posted seep limit of 80 kmph (50 mph) and the north/south roadway had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). It was afternoon on a weekday. The roads were wet and it was raining. Traffic flow was moderate.
V1, a 1993 Mercury Sable with one occupant, was westbound in lane two approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V2, a 1997 Chevrolet G-Series van with two occupants, was also westbound ahead of V1, approaching the same intersection where it intended to turn left. As V2 came to a stop in preparation for its turn, V1 attempted to stop but lost traction on the wet road and slid into the rear of V2. V1 was towed due to damage, while V2 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 73-year-old female, reported no injuries. She stated she saw V2 slowing to make the left turn and she than glanced in her rearview mirror to check following traffic. When her focus returned forward she was closer then she thought to V2 and applied her brakes. V1's brakes locked and it slid on the wet pavement striking V2.
The Driver of V2, a 79-year-old male, complained of chest pain after the crash (the passenger complained of neck pain and were both transported). The driver stated that he had come to a stop in lane two in order to make a left turn. While he was waiting for traffic to clear he was struck from behind by V1. V2 made no avoidance maneuvers.
