This two-vehicle crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a fully controlled, divided highway. There were two northbound and two southbound lanes divided by raised metal guardrails. There were wide shoulder areas on the right sides of both directions. The asphalt roadway was dry, level, and straight. There were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday during the late morning daylight hours. The roadway was free of any defects and the traffic flow was normal for this roadway.
Vehicle one (V1), 1999 Buick Century sedan, was northbound in lane one when it entered lane two occupied by vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Lincoln Town Car sedan. V2 struck V1 as it crossed its path of travel. After the initial impact, V2 crossed over lane one onto the shoulder area where it contacted with its front the metal guardrail and light pole. V2 continued forward flipping over the guardrail and coming to final rest in the grassy area beyond the guardrail facing south on its right side. V1, after the impact with V2 re-entered lane one, climbed up the guardrail and rolled over onto its left side. It came to final rest on the shoulder area. Both vehicles suffered severe damage and were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 23-year old male, said he was northbound in lane one when he decided to enter lane two already occupied by V2. He said he was not paying attention the way he should have been and may have been daydreaming for a moment or two. Normally he said he would have waited until the other lane was clear before entering. He is familiar with the roadway he travels on it weekly. He's been a licensed driver for over six years and he was not in a particular rush as he was going to visit a friend. He was eventually transported from the scene to the hospital by medics with minor injuries.
The driver of V2, a 49-year old male, after several attempts were made, refused to take part of the study. He was transported to the hospital with minor injuries.
