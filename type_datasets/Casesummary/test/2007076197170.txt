This three-vehicle crash occurred in a business area at the intersection of a 7-lane asphalt roadway that runs east and west and a 6-lane roadway that runs north and south. The westbound lanes curve right and are level. The southbound lanes are straight and level. The intersection is controlled by on-color traffic lights for all directions of travel. The speed limit for the area is posted at 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred early afternoon with no adverse weather or road conditions present.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Crown Victoria fully marked Police Interceptor with lights activated, was parked in the middle of the intersection facing west controlling traffic for a funeral procession. The police officer was out of the vehicle directing traffic. All traffic stopped for the procession to go westbound. The driver believed all funeral vehicles had passed through and he got into his vehicle to make a traffic stop on a truck that had illegally turned left at the intersection during the procession. V1 began to turn right, then stopped for two vehicles to go westbound. V1 proceeded to turn right and was impacted on it's front right side by the left front corner of vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Nissan Frontier pickup that was westbound in the #2 lane. V2 was part of the procession and believed the police vehicle was still conducting traffic control. Also, the traffic control light was green for westbound traffic. After the initial impact, V1 rotated counter-clockwise and with it's right side plane impacted the left side plane of V2. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing north on the slightly raised median north of the intersection. The front-end plane of V1 was pushed into the left side plane of vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Dodge Stratus. V3 had been stopped in the #1 southbound lane at the traffic control light waiting to turn right (west). V1 rotated counter-clockwise and it's right side plane side-slapped the left side plane of V3. V1 came to rest facing south in the intersection. V3 was pushed over the curb at the northwest corner of the intersection and came to rest in an irrigation ditch that runs east and west. V1 was driven from the scene to an impound yard. V2 and V3 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a thirty one (31) year-old male police officer, had been conducting traffic control for the funeral. He believed the path was clear to turn right from where he was parked in the intersection. He also believed that since his police lights were activated, that all traffic should yield.
The driver of V2, a forty eight (48) year-old male and his passenger, were part of the funeral procession for a relative. He is familiar with the roadway although he lives in another state. He stated he saw the police vehicle in the intersection and had switched from the inside to the outside lane to clear it before entering the intersection. He stated it was facing west and as he entered the intersection V1 turned right in front of him. He braked and steered right but contacted V1 on the right side near the front.
The driver of V3, a twenty one (21) year-old female on her way home from attending a class, was stopped in the #1 southbound lane waiting to turn right when she was impacted by V1.
