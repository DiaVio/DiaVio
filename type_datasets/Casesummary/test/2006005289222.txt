This two-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours at a three-way intersection, which was controlled by light signals in all directions. The east/west roadway upon which both vehicles were traveling consisted of two lanes, one in each direction. The roadway was dry when the crash occurred and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions. The gradient for both vehicles involved was determined to be level. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a black 1994 Jeep Wrangler, was traveling east on the roadway approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a black 2004 Oldsmobile Alero, was also heading east in front of V1. V2 had stopped at the light intending to turn left at the intersection. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. The impact caused both vehicles to continue forward slightly before coming to final rest in the original lane of travel. Both vehicles had to be removed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 a 19 year-old male, sustained unknown injuries, however, her head did make contact with the windshield. She was transported to a medical facility for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. Numerous attempts to contact the driver could not yield an interview. It is therefore uncertain whether any fatigue or health related factors contributed to this crash. One possible associated factor coded for this vehicle was a brake failure. The brake line was observed to be rusted and leaking fluid. She relayed to the officer that she pumped the brakes, but they did not work.
The driver of V2, a 19 year-old female, did not sustain any injuries as a result of the crash. There were no other occupants present in the vehicle when the crash occurred. She related that she was at a complete stop waiting to turn left to go to school. All of the sudden she was hit by the other vehicle. No health or fatigue related factors were coded for this driver.
