The crash occurred on an east/west urban two-lane road. The lightly traveled straight level road was intersected by one set of railroad tracks that run north/south. The railroad tracks are tree-lined, limiting sight distances for both automobiles and trains. No crossing gate is present, only railroad crossbucks. Conditions were daylight and wet on a weekday morning. It had rained earlier in the day but wasn't raining at the time of the incident. The posted speed limit was 48 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle #1 was a 1999 GMC Safari work van traveling east on the two-lane road. A train, consisting of an engine and one boxcar loaded with lumber, was southbound on the railroad tracks. Vehicle #1 crossed the railroad tracks and the train struck its left side and pushed it down the tracks. The van came to rest 50m south of impact just off the west edge of the tracks facing east against the front of the train. The van was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 19-year old male who was not restrained. He, along with his wife in the front right passenger seat, were transported to a local trauma center for treatment. The driver was pinned by the left front door and instrument panel and endured a lengthy extrication process. The driver airbag did not deploy but the passenger frontal airbag fired in the severe left front collision. EDR data was retrieved from the vehicle but the delta V was not deemed reliable after discussions with SCI personnel. Apparently, the diagnostics for the module were damaged during initial impact, which also may have contributed to only one of the airbags deploying. That particular module model didn't include any precrash information.
The van driver was traveling on the road for the first time and stated he slowed down to about 8-16 kmph (5-10 mph) as he approached the tracks but did not stop. He said he didn't see the train until he was on the tracks and a collision was imminent. He has no hearing disorders and the radio was off, but he believes he and the passenger were talking just prior to the collision.
The train was operated by a 26-year-old male that was accompanied on the engine by a conductor. Protocol is for the engineer to look left at crossings and the conductor to view right. The engineer stated the conductor yelled and that he applied emergency brake approximately one second prior to impact. Estimated speed for the train was 16 kmph (10 mph) and the engineer says the horn was being blown as they approached the crossing. They both stated that the van driver was looking straight ahead just prior to contact. The engineer also cited limited site distance as contributing to the collision.
