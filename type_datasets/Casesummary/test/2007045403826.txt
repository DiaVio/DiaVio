This crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a divided six-lane interstate highway. There were three lanes in each direction divided by a concrete barrier wall. The bituminous roadway was dry, level, and curved to the left (in the northbound direction). The roadway featured a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday night with a dark unlit roadway under clear skies while traffic was light.
V1, a 2004 Chrysler Sebring four door with one occupant, was northbound in lane one. Based on the researcher's observations of evidence at the scene, the driver lost control of his vehicle for an unknown reason. The vehicle started skidding in a counter-clockwise rotation across all three northbound lanes. It struck the concrete median barrier with its front left (Event 1) and veered to the right about 6 m. At that point the left rear of V1 struck the barrier again (Event 2). The vehicle then rotated in a clockwise direction and skidded to the right back across all three lanes spilling oil across the lanes. The vehicle then went off the right edge of the roadway and down a grassy embankment (slope 38%) and then across a stretch of level grass where it struck a small tree, less than 10 cm in diameter (Event 3), and came to rest facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver and police officer were gone when the researcher arrived at the scene. An officer still at the scene told the researcher that the driver appeared to be DUI and was transported to a hospital. Evidence in the vehicle indicated that the driver had been drinking intoxicants. The researcher could not obtain any information about the driver and was later not able to obtain the police accident report because the police could not find it.
