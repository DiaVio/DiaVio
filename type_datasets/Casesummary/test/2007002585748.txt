The front of V1 struck and rode up a guardrail. V1 continued forward and struck a road sign and the guardrail again before rolling left four-quarter turns. V1 struck three trees before coming to final rest facing in a northeast in a ditch. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
