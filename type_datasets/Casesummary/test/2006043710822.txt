This single event crash occurred in the southbound lane of an undivided two-lane roadway. There was one northbound and one southbound lane. This was a straight, level, wet, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). It was late morning on a weekday and the sky was overcast with light rain. Traffic flow was minimal.
V1, a 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup truck with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. V2, a 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup truck with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one in front of V1. V2 slowed down in the roadway to avoid hitting a dog that was walking on the right side of the roadway. V1 was traveling southbound toward the rear of V2 and did not reduce its speed. The driver of V1 never saw V2 driving slowly in front of him and contacted the rear of V2. The collision occurred in lane one and both vehicles came to final rest in lane one. The driver of V1 was not injured. The driver of V2 was injured and transported by EMS to the hospital for treatment Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 71-year old male who was retired and disabled. The driver just came from a fast food restaurant near the crash scene and was on his way to a rental property to do repairs. He claimed he was traveling approximately 72 kmph (45 mph) and slammed into the rear of V2. He said V2 was stopped in the roadway with no signal or brake lights activated. He said he was looking straight ahead, but never saw V2 in the roadway. He thinks the cloudy, rainy roadway contributed to his inability to see V2. (Note: DMV records show that the driver of V1 was involved in a similar crash in 1999, where he failed to reduce speed and contacted the rear of the vehicle in front of him, who was stopped, in the travel lane waiting to make a left turn.)
V2 was driven by a 39-year old male who was working at the time of the crash. He reported that he had been driving down the road at 72 kmph (45 mph) when he saw a dog on the right side of the road, partially in his lane. He checked all three mirrors to ensure nobody was behind him before slowing down to 24 kmph (15 mph). He waited for 5-10 seconds for the dog to move out of road, so he could proceed without hitting it, when he was unexpectedly hit from the rear. The impact caused his truck to be pushed forward an unknown number of feet before coming to final rest. V2 suffered disabling damage, and the driver was transported to a trauma center with neck and back injuries.
