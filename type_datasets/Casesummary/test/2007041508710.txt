The crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The east/west roadway was a two-way, seven-lane street divided by a concrete curbed median. The north/south roadway was a two-way, three-lane undivided street. These were straight, level, asphalt roadways, with an east/west posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph), and a north/south posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). The intersection was controlled in all directions by a traffic light. Conditions were daylight on a weekend afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer utility vehicle with one occupant, was traveling westbound, changing lanes from lane three over to lane one. V2, a 2003 Acura TL 4-door sedan with one occupant, was stopped in lane one, facing southbound. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the two vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V1 made contact with the left side of V2. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The Chevy Trailblazer was driven by a 36-year old male who was not injured. He could not be reached for interview. A witness to the crash was stopped for a red light facing westbound in lane one. She stated that the light had been solid red for quite some time when she observed the driver of V1 fly by her in lane two or three. The witness said that the Trailblazer entered the intersection at full speed, without slowing down. However, she could not ascertain whether the other driver intentionally ran the red light, or simply did not recognize that the light was red.
The Acura TL was driven by a 56-year old male who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way from the bank to his house. The driver indicated that he had been stopped at the light, facing south. When his light turned green, the driver began to accelerate into the intersection. He believed that V2 was in lane one (right curb lane) as he entered the intersection. According to the motorist, he did not see the other vehicle before impact, but thought that V2 had changed lanes from behind stopped traffic in order to find an open lane from which to enter the intersection. He described the other driver's post-crash demeanor as agitated and somewhat intimidating. The other driver initially accused him of running the red light, until witnesses came forward at the scene.
