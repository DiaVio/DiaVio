V1 was a 2005 Toyota Corolla that was traveling in lane three heading eastbound. The roads were wet and slick due to the heavy rain. V2, a 1993 Ford Ranger truck had stopped in lane three for backed up traffic when he was hit from behind by V1 thus pushing him into V3, a 2001 Lexus RX300, who had come to a crawl due to slowed traffic. After this first harmful event V4, a 1996 Chrysler Sebring had just come through the intersection when he glanced down at his directions and when he looked back up V1 was at a sudden stop. This is when the driver of V4 then hit the back of V1. The driver of V2 stated that there was two separate impacts within 5-10 seconds of the first supporting the idea of two separate crashes. V1 and V4 were both towed due to damages and no one was injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V1 was driven by a 46-year-old woman who was on her way to the mall before she had to work. She stated that she was in the third lane of travel when the traffic came to a crawl due to heavy rainfall. The driver stated that she tried to stop in time but was not able to. She then stated that she was then hit from behind. It all happened so fast that she wasn't sure if she caused the crash or if the driver who hit her caused the crash. She was not injured but her car was towed due to injuries
V2 was driven by a 19-year-old college student who was on his way to a friends house when he stated that he was stopped in lane three for backed up traffic when he was hit from behind by V1 and was then pushed into V3 who was decelerating also in lane three. He also stated in his interview that he was then hit from behind again about 5-10 seconds after the first impact. This would support that there were 2 separate crashes. There were no associative factors related to this driver.
V3 was driven by a 22-year-old woman who was running an errand when she stated that the roads were wet and the traffic was getting congested due to the rain. The driver stated that she was slowing down in lane three when she was hit by V2 from behind. She also felt 2 impacts within seconds.
V4 was driven by a 42-year-old male on his way back to work.

The driver tried to steer to the right and hit the brakes to avoid hitting the back of V1. The driver of V4 was not successful but then realized that the traffic had stopped because V1 had already hit V2.

The officer on scene was unable to make a decision as to who caused the crash, as there were no witnesses.
