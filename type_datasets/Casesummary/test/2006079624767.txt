This two-vehicle collision occurred during late evening hours on a weeknight. It was dark, and overhead street lamps illuminated the crash scene. The crash occurred on a curved stretch of a dry, five-lane, two-way, undivided, bituminous, east-west roadway. The roadway is sloped slightly downhill for eastbound traffic. The right-most travel lanes are bordered on the outside by bicycle lanes in each direction, and posted signs prohibit parking along the curbs. The speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) in both directions. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Lexus ES350 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the second lane, curving towards its right. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Volkswagen Touareg 4-door hatchback, was stopped in the bike lane along the south curb. As V1 rounded the curve, it departed its lane to the left, crossed all travel lanes, and impacted V2 head-on. V1 rode up onto the raised curb, damaging its left front wheel, then rolled two quarter-turns towards its left side as it slid along the curb-line. V1 came to rest upside down partially off the roadway. V2 was knocked backward by the impact and entered the roadway, where it came to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
