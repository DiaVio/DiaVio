The accident this day took place on a two-lane, undivided north/south roadway at a T-intersection with an east/west roadway. The east/west roadway intersected the north/south roadway at about a 25-30 degree angle. The east/west roadway was controlled by a stop sign, while the north/south roadway had no traffic control device. The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway was 40 kmph (25 mph), and the east/west roadway was posted at 32 kmph (20 mph). V1, a 1996 Ford Taurus, was traveling north. V2, a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo, was traveling west. At the time of the crash, it was raining heavily and the roadway was wet.
The driver of V1, a male of unknown age, was driving his two daughters to school. He stated that he was following a non-contact vehicle as he approached the T-intersection. The driver of V1 stated that the vehicle in front of him made a right hand turn into the eastbound roadway. The driver of V1 attempted to go around the non-contact vehicle as it made its right turn. As he did so, V2, which had been stopped facing west at the stop sign, pulled out onto the north/south roadway, intending to turn left. The left front corner of V1 impacted the left rear side of V2. After being struck by V1, V2 was rotated in a counterclockwise direction, striking a utility pole aft the "C" pillar on the right side of the vehicle. V2 came to rest against the pole facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
