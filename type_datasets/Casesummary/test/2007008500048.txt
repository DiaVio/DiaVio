This crash occurred in an intersection, in the southbound lanes of a five-lane roadway. The roadway was straight, level, bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (45 mph). It was early evening on a weekday and conditions were clear.
V1, a 1999 Volkswagen Passat was traveling northbound in lane three the left turning lane. V2, a 2005 Hyundai Elantra was traveling southbound in lane two. There was a stop light at the intersection with signage to yield on green to make a left turn. V1 began to make a left turn and the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 rotated 180 degrees and came to final rest facing southeast in the southbound lanes. V2 came to final rest facing southwest in lane one of the southbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V1 was driven by a 54 year-old female. According to the driver, she saw three oncoming vehicles that were far enough away from her to make the turn. She however did not see V2. The driver also thought that she had a green arrow, but did not. She was on her way to a business appointment and was running about five minutes late. This may have caused her to not pay as much attention to the road as she normally would. She also does not travel this roadway very often.
V2 was driven by a 22 year-old male and there was a 20 year-old female passenger. The driver of V2 stated that he saw the other vehicle slowing in the turning lane at the intersection, and that the vehicle suddenly pulled out in front of him. The driver attempted to steer to the right and locked up the brakes of the vehicle but there was too little time to react.
