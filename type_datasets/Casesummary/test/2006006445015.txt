This two-vehicle crash took place on a 3-lane (4 lanes at point of impact) northbound roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). There were no shoulder lanes, and on either side of this roadway there were grassy medians, which separated the 3 lanes from other travel lanes. This stretch of asphalt roadway was dry, level, and straight. The crash occurred in lane 2 on a clear weekday afternoon.
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 1997 Ford Taurus driven by a 20-year-old male, answered only a few questions while on-scene. He stated that he was driving in lane 2 when an SUV cut him off from his left in lane 3 and he lost control and couldn't avoid striking the rear of V2, which was stopped in front of him at a red light. The driver claimed that he hit V2 on an angle, a statement that was not consistent with the vehicle damage. After a few more questions, the driver became very agitated and he stated that he no longer wanted to take part in the survey. His 23-year-old wife was present and had been seated in the front passenger seat. She refused to answer any questions. Upon striking the rear of V2, V1 pushed V2 through the intersection, crossed lane 1 to its right side, and then departed the roadway. At its final rest, all four tires were on the grassy median and V1 had barely struck a generic highway sign that was posted on two thin metal rails. This last impact was so minor that the sign was not at all bent. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2003 Toyota Camry driven by a 79-year-old male, was stopped at a red light in lane 2. This driver and this vehicle were found in a nearby parking lot. He stated that after he had been struck in the rear by V1, he wasn't sure what had happened. A medic unit had quickly arrived and taken his wife to the hospital. When the driver of V2 asked the driver of V1 what had happened, the young driver stated that it was a silver SUV with an out-of-State license plate that caused the accident and asked the driver of V2 to go and try to locate this SUV. The driver of V2 later acknowledged that he felt very "silly" (verbatim) that he had listened to the driver of V1, and moreover, that he shouldn't have gone after the SUV regardless of whether or not the driver of V1 was being truthful. When asked how he ended up in the parking lot, he explained that as soon as he realized that his actions of trying to locate this silver SUV were silly, he began to make his way back to the crash scene. Because it was very difficult to access this roadway due to all of the lanes and medians, he pulled into a parking lot to assess his situation. That was when he noticed that his back left tire was going flat and that he should no longer drive this vehicle. He had the dealership send for a tow truck.
An interview was obtained with the driver of the SUV in the adjacent lane. According to this driver, the driver of V1 didn't realize that traffic had stopped in lane 2 because he was engaged in a road rage incident. The driver of the SUV explained that he had been driving along in lane 3. He stated that his wife was in the passenger seat and his three children were in the second row. His intention was to change lanes so he activated his signal and checked his right-side mirror. At the very same time, he heard honking and he noticed in his side-view mirror that V1 was accelerating and not allowing this driver to change lanes. The SUV driver stated that he didn't appreciate this, but he remained in his lane and continued driving. Within a few hundred feet was a traffic light that had just turned red, and the driver of the SUV stated that as he was coming to a very controlled stop, V1 went racing past him on his right in lane 2 and slammed square into the rear of V2, which was stopped at the red light. The driver of the SUV stated that the driver of V1 had been yelling obscenities and making gestures with his middle finger for these few hundred feet as reported to him by his wife and daughters. This driver stated to the police that he actually witnessed these gestures, though he stated during a separate interview that it was his family who witnessed the road rage and that he was focused on driving. The driver of the SUV stated that he first drove off but after a discussion with his family, he felt that the correct thing to do was to return to the scene of the crash so that the authorities could be made aware of the actual crash events.
Emergency medical units were dispatched to the scene. Only the passenger of V2 was transported to an emergency room due to unknown injury. It was later learned that the driver of V2 had sustained a dislocated shoulder.
