The crash occurred on a rural secondary arterial road that ran north/south along the portion where the crash took place. The road was a two-way, two-lane traffic way divided by a double yellow stripe, with no shoulders (it was bordered on the west by a 1.2m wide drainage ditch that was also 0.8m deep) and was curved to the left (south) from a southwest heading. The curve radius at the apex (about 93m pre road departure) was 213m. The precrash grade was -12.7% and the grade of the roadway in the crash area was -2.4%. The grade from the roadway into the ditch at the run off road point was -63%. The west side of the road was heavily treed. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry on a weekday morning with a speed limit of 48kph/30mph.
V1 was a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado Extended Cab pickup truck headed south when after negotiating the curve it departed the right side of the road (where the roads edge was crumbling), and continued along the right side of the road (partially on and partially off the road) until it struck a tree (about 60cm diameter) with its front end close to the right side. V1 then went into a yaw left (clockwise) and re-entered the road for about 23 meters until it departed the right side again and struck another (smaller) tree with its front again and rotated clockwise again coming to rest facing northwest just a few meters south of impact #2 with the left front wheel in the ditch and the rest of the vehicle in the roadway. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a twenty-five year old female who was not belted and sustained non-incapacitating injuries in the crash. She was transported to a local hospital via EMS. The driver was on her way to work at the time of the crash.
