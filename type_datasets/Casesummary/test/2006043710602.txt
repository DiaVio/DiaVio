This single vehicle crash occurred in the late evening of a weekday on the right roadside of a two-way, two-lane, non-divided roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction and featured a speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with a positive grade of 8%. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2000 Chrysler Town and County minivan with two occupants, was southbound in lane one. As V1 continued south it departed roadway to the right side and traveled down the grass shoulder (-18% slope). The vehicle traveled on the grass shoulder approximately 37 Meters (122 feet) before colliding with a 40 cm (16 inches) tree. The vehicle rotated clockwise approximately 30 degrees before coming to final rest against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 23 year-old male who originally claimed to be sleeping in the backseat. An interviewed was not obtained with the driver however the 43 year-old passenger (who claimed to be driving) provided much information. She claimed was they were on their way to pick up some of her (recently imprisoned) son's belonging from a friend's house. She stated she developed a sharp pain on the left side of her head that traveled down her left arm. She remembers becoming lightheaded, dizzy and seeing large spots in front of her eyes. Her first memory was feeling pressure on her chest caused by her seat belt loading, then she opened her eyes and saw that she had hit a tree. She has no memory of departing the roadway and hitting the tree. She has a history of blackouts and reported feeling the same symptoms several times in the past year. Her injuries indicate that she was a passenger in the vehicle. The other occupant (the driver's brother-in-law) had a revoked drivers license and denied driving the vehicle in interviews with police and myself, he even took off his shirt to prove he had seat belt bruises consistent with being a passenger, but none were visible. The female driver admits that when she doesn't feel well she's let her brother-in-law drive, even though it is not legal.
