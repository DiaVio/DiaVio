The speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph). At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric condition, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Pontiac Grand Prix four-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the second lane, about to pass through an intersection. As V1 entered the intersection, the vehicle in front of V1 came to a sudden stop. V1 changed lanes to the left to pass the stopped vehicle, not realizing that a dog had entered the roadway. As V1 passed the stopped car, the dog entered the second lane. V1 veered left to avoid the dog and began skidding across the center stripes. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Honda CR-V four-door SUV, was traveling eastbound in the second lane of opposing traffic. As V1 entered the second eastbound lane, the front of V1 impacted the front of V2. Both vehicles deflected southeast. V1 came to rest facing northeast in the eastbound lanes. V2 departed the road over the south curb (impacting the curb with the front wheels) and came to rest facing southeast, partly off the roadway.
