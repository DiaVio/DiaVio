The crash occurred in the northbound lane two of a three lane undivided roadway with two lanes in the northbound direction and one lane in the southbound direction. Lane two in the northbound direction was a temporary passing lane. This was a slight right curving road in the northbound direction and a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). There was an entrance to an adjacent road on the west side of the southbound lane. The road was dry and the sky was cloudy during this weekday late afternoon commuting hour. This was a well-traveled rural road with continual traffic in both directions.
V1, a 2000 a Chrysler 300M 4-door sedan was driven by a 20 year-old male traveling with his 12 year-old sister. The driver stated that he had picked-up his sister 25 minutes prior to the crash and was traveling north in lane two at a rate of less then 56 kmph (35 mph), same speed as vehicles ahead of him, when he saw V2 stop suddenly, for no reason, without a turn signal. In an unsuccessful attempt to avoid a collision, he steered right, but crashed into the right rear portion of V2 with the left front portion of V1. The occupants were not transported for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2003 Acura 3.2 TL 2-door coupe was driven by a 63 year-old female. She had stopped 15 minutes prior to the crash to pick-up a bottle of water from the store on her way to meet friends at a work related event. She was stopped, in northbound lane two, attempting a left turn, waiting for a break in the oncoming traffic when the crash occurred. She stated that prior to the crash, she had the left indicator activated and was stopped in lane two for at least a minute. The impact caused her vehicle to spin counter-clock-wise, almost 75 degrees and almost into oncoming traffic, before her vehicle came to rest. The driver was transported for possible injuries.
A witness stated that V2, prior to stopping, had veered slightly right and then back prior to stopping. V1 was following about 30 feet behind V2 and was probably confused by the driver's movements and that V2 did not signal that the intention was to turn left. V1 tried to avoid a collision by steering left, unsuccessfully.
