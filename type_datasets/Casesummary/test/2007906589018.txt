This four-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of the block several feet beyond an intersection in the westbound lane of travel. There were no dividing lines separating the two-way roadway. The roadway consisted of one westbound and one eastbound lane. There were no signalized traffic control devices at this middle of the block location. In the center of these lanes were metal trolley tracks planted in cement. The road surface was bituminous dry and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash occurred on a weekend during the early morning daylight hours. The roadway was free of any defects and the traffic flow was normal for this roadway.
Vehicle one, 2004 Wabash Large Truck Tractor w/Trailer, was traveling westbound when the top of the trailer caught onto a low hanging trolley support wire pulling it several feet. The support wire was attached to a pole weighing approximately 3200 lbs. Eventually the pole was pulled from the cement base and fell onto the top of vehicle two, a 1994 Chevrolet Astro SUV, also traveling westbound behind vehicle one. After the impact, vehicle two traveled a single foot where it came to final rest disabled by the contact with the pole. Vehicle one, unaware it was pulling the wire continued to travel westbound coming to a stop only after being notified by other drivers of the event. Vehicle three, a 2006 Ford Escape was traveling westbound behind V2, it was impacted on its top, by the wire and received minor damages and was released prior to the researcher's arrival. Vehicle four, a 1993 Nissan Maxima four door sedan, was traveling eastbound on the same roadway in the opposite direction and it also was struck by the wire and was allowed to leave the scene prior to the researcher's arrival. Vehicle two damages were disabling and it was towed from the scene. The other vehicles damages were minor and they were not towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The support wires are attached to various size poles located in the middle of the roadway and on both sides of the curbed area. They support the electrical system servicing the trolleys. The cities public transportation manager and the cities police large truck enforcements noted that these wires sometimes sag under the hot heat of the summer weather.
The driver of vehicle one, a 37-year old male, said he was traveling straight at about 56 kmph (35 mph) on his way to make another delivery several miles away when he noticed other drivers looking at him strangely. One of them pointed to the top of his truck where he saw he was pulling a cable. When he looked back he saw people helping the driver and children out of the van behind him where a pole had fallen. He'd heard a loud noise a few minutes ago but paid no attention. Maybe it was the pole falling onto the truck. He's been driving large trucks for only four months and has been working for this company for two months. He travels on this roadway weekly. He also said that he slept six hours in the last 24 hours and normally sleeps 8 hours. He was not injured.
The driver of vehicle two, a 49-year old male, although there were several attempts made, he could not be reached for an interview. Including him there were seven occupants in his vehicle, many which were children. He and all of the occupants were transported to the hospital with various injuries, none which were life threatening.
Vehicle three, a 2006 For Escape and Vehicle four, a 1993 Nissan Maxima four 4/door sedan, were not involved in the first harmful event.
