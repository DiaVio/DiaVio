This crash occurred on a two-lane northbound entrance ramp. The ramp had a right curve with a radius of curvature of 161m and a super elevation of 7 percent. The advisory speed was posted at 56kmph (35mph). The roadway was level concrete. The weather was cloudy with light snow. The roadway had spots of black ice.
Vehicle 1, a 2000 Chevrolet Venture minivan, was traveling north in lane 1 of the entrance ramp next to an unknown tractor-trailer. There was no contact between V1 and the truck. The driver of V1 thought that the truck would not let her merge onto the interstate and steered to the right. The driver of V1 then lost control and traveled off the right side of the roadway, scraping the bridge abutment. V1 then traveled up an embankment to strike a highway sign, breaking off the signpost. The vehicle then traveled to the west across all lanes of travel to contact the center median wall. V1 came to final rest facing southeast across the shoulder and lane #2. The driver was transported to a local trauma unit due to injuries. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
A 43-year-old female drove V1. She reported being in good health and taking no medications. She does not wear corrective lenses. This driver reported she was on her way to have lunch with friends when the crash occurred. She stated that where the east and westbound ramps to the northbound interstate came together she was traveling in lane #1. She stated that she thought the two lanes merged together. She stated the semi truck would not let her merge to the left so she steered right and then decelerated. She lost control and traveled off the roadway on the right side and contacted the wall with her right side. She stated she then slid along the wall before climbing the embankment and then contacting a highway sign. She then rotated to the left to travel down the embankment and traveled across all the travel lanes to contact the center median wall. She then came to final rest facing south. The driver stated she thought her arm was broken. She stated at final rest she was afraid of being hit by northbound traffic because of the ice.
The witness to this crash stated he never saw any semi truck - he only saw V1 crossing the interstate very fast.
