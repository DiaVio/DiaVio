Vehicle one, a 2000 Ford F-150 pickup, was traveling southbound in lane one of the roadway. The driver came upon a four-way intersection and proceeded on through with a steady green traffic light. As the driver was continuing to go straight, a 1999 Ford Escort 2-door coupe that had been traveling northbound turned left in front of V1. V1 struck the right side of V2 with its front end. The driver of V1 did make an attempt to brake but was not successful in avoiding the crash. No skid marks were found on the roadway. V2 suffered moderate-to-severe damage on its right side and was later towed. V2 had one occupant in the front right passenger seat. The passenger was transported to a medical facility to be evaluated. The driver did not suffer any injuries. V1 suffered minor damage to its front. V1 was not towed and was driven away from the scene by the driver. The driver of V1 did not sustain any injuries from the crash. The travel speed of V1 was estimated to be 25-30 mph. The travel speed for V2 was unknown, as an interview could not be obtained. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 22 year-old male in generally good health, stated he was in the process of moving his belongings to a new home when the crash occurred. Cargo was discovered in the bed of the pickup; a mattress and box spring set (full size) weighing in at approximately 65 lbs. The front right passenger compartment contained a full set of luggage, contents of which were clothes. The approximate weight given by the driver was 40 lbs. There was no cargo shift involved with these two separate loads of cargo. The driver stated that as he was entering the intersection (to go straight) he noticed V2 "hesitating to make his turn." As he proceeded, he saw V2 begin its turn. At that point, the driver slammed on his brakes to try and avoid the collision, but was not successful. The driver noted no locking up of the brakes. The driver related that this was a road on which he travels frequently - "a few times a week." The driver was coming from his home (approx. five miles away) en route to his new home, which was "five minutes away (from the crash scene)" when the crash occurred. All windows of V1 were tinted (percent unknown).
The driver of V2, a 21 year-old male was reached once by the researcher, but was not able to speak at the time. The driver did disclose he was from out-of-state and that he was given a citation for careless driving by the police officer. Future calls were made to the driver and his passenger, but were unsuccessful. The driver was driving his girlfriend's vehicle - no other details were obtained from the driver of V2.
