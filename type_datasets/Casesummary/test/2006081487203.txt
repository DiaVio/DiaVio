He was coming from work, and headed to have a lunch meeting with his family. He was listening to the radio at the time. He is familiar with his vehicle, but only drives that roadway monthly.
The driver of V2 was a 62 year-old female who is reportedly in good health, with no hearing restrictions. Her unknown sight condition is corrected with glasses, and she was wearing them at the time of the crash. She was well rested and the only prescription drug she takes is Atenolol. She stated that her light was red, had stopped for more than 10 seconds, and that she had just proceeded forward when it turned green. She was on her way back to work from her lunch break. This was her first time on the road in 19 months, as that stretch of roadway has been closed for quite some time.
