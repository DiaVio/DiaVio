This two-vehicle crash took place on a weekday morning on a four-lane, east/westbound roadway with a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). There was also a shoulder lane on either side. This roadway was straight and level and free of any defect. There was a bus stop on the right or north curb, and as buses picked up passengers, the front of the bus was in the right shoulder lane near the curb to allow for passenger entry, while the majority of the bus remained in lane 1, a travel lane. The morning sky was cloudy and the asphalt road surface was dry. The crash took place in westbound lane 1.
Vehicle 1 (V1) was a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee driven by a 32-year old male. During an on-scene interview the driver explained that he had been hired to work at a social engagement the night before, and that it turned into an all-night event. On his way home he stopped to have breakfast at a diner. He stated that when he pulled out of the parking lot he made a right turn into lane 1 and began to travel west. He drove for a couple of blocks and, while driving, he attempted to buckle his seat belt. His shirt was covering his seat belt buckle and he acknowledged that he looked down to find it. While he was internally distracted in his efforts to put his seat belt on, he struck a public transport bus that had stopped in front of him to pick up passengers. This driver, the bus, and all east/west travel had a green light at the approaching intersection, but the driver stated that he wasn't really aware that there was a bus stop before the intersection and that the bus, or that any traffic would stop without proceeding through the intersection given the green light. Driver also acknowledged that he was tired. The front of V1 struck the left rear of the bus. V1 sustained disabling damage and was towed from its final rest in lane 1. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2002 New Flyer full size public transport bus, was driven by a 58-year old male. A supervisor for the driver of V2 was present at the crash scene and he refused to allow for any participation in this study. He stated that there was to be no vehicle inspection, no photographs, and no interview with the driver of V2. Based on the physical evidence and some discussions that were overheard at the scene it is known that the bus had its doors open to pick up its passengers at the time it was struck. It is also known that it had been stopped for not more than 10 seconds. It was most likely only a few seconds that the bus was actually stopped, otherwise the passengers at the stop would have been in the process of boarding. V2 remained fully functional and was able to drive away from the scene.
Emergency medical units were dispatched to the scene and though the driver of V1 had a visible abrasion on his head, he stated that he wasn't hurt and was not in need of transport or medical attention. The driver of V2 suffered no injuries.
