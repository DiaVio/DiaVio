This two-vehicle crash occurred at an urban four-legged intersection with pedestrian crosswalks in all directions. North/south traffic had no traffic control devices while east/west traffic is controlled by stop signs. Eastbound approach is straight with a -5.6% downhill profile and legal parking allowed on both sides of the roadway. Northbound approach is straight with a slight uphill profile and no parking allowed along the road. All directions had curbs and sidewalks present with a posted speed limit of 56 kph (35 mph). Setting was afternoon hours on a weekday. Conditions were daylight and clear with a few clouds present.
Vehicle 1 is a 2005 Hyundai Elentra, four-door with one occupant traveling eastbound in lane one. Vehicle 2 is a 2005 Ford F-150, pickup truck with two occupants traveling northbound in lane one. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and collided at a right angle. The front plane of V2 contacted the right plane of V1 (event 1). In an attempt to avoid the crash, V1 accelerated just prior to impact. After impact, V1 rotated clockwise. While V1 was rotating clockwise, it departed the roadway to the left, over a raised curb and on a grass patch and sidewalk on the northeast side of the intersection. V1 traveled 29 meters (95 feet) after impact before coming to final rest in the roadway facing southeast. V2 traveled 14.2 meters (47 feet) after impact and came to final rest in its original travel lane, facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 19 year-old female who was not injured in the crash. She had spent the afternoon hanging out at her boyfriend's apartment about 7 miles away. She was on her way back to college, where she had cross-country track practice. She had never been on this roadway before and was unfamiliar with the area. She claims that despite looking straight ahead and not being distracted by any interior or exterior sources, she failed to see the stop sign to her right. As she went through the intersection, she saw that V2 was going to strike her right side. She accelerated and steered left to try and avoid a collision, but failed. After impact, she closed her eyes and braced the wheel until her car stopped. Her vehicle was towed but didn't suffer disabling damage.
The driver of V2 is a 22 year-old male who was not injured in the crash. Himself and a co-worker had just left their office a few blocks away and were heading to the bank. They were socially talking to each while driving. He reported driving at 56-64 kph (35-40 mph), when all of a sudden V2 came out from the left side street at a high rate of speed. It happened so fast that he didn't have time to hit the brakes or try and steer around her. He struck V2's right side and because his airbags deployed, he couldn't see V1's post crash movement. His vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage.
