This single-vehicle crash occurred in the morning on an east/west highway divided by a grass median. There were 4 lanes westbound and 5 lanes eastbound. There was a 2-lane entrance ramp at the location of the crash for westbound traffic. The posted speed limit for both directions was 89 kmph (55 mph). Both roadways were level. Weather conditions were dry and cloudy.
V1, a 2003 Toyota Camry with one occupant, was traveling west in an unknown lane when its driver departed the left side of the roadway, traveled across the grass median and entered the eastbound lanes, traveling west. V1 departed the south side of the eastbound roadway, and struck two trees before striking a bridge overpass and then another tree. V1 rolled down the embankment into the eastbound lanes and came to rest facing north across lanes 3 and 4. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 41-year old female who normally works from home but had to visit the office twice this week for meetings. She was driving to work this morning for the only the second time in three months because her company urged long-distance commuters to work from home because of the recent increase in gas prices. She admits that she was talking to her friend on her handheld mobile phone about when and where to host her son's birthday party. While talking on the phone, she thinks she missed the exit she was supposed to take toward her work but she could not recall any details about the crash. Her only her memory of the crash sequence was getting out of her car and realizing she was in the middle of the highway. She had a history of seizures and took Dilantin this morning along with a daily multivitamin. She suffered a minor laceration to her face and a little bruising from the seat belt and she was treated and released from the hospital.
A "witness" who was interviewed stated that V1 drove off the bridge, which was incorrect.
