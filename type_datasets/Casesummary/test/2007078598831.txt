The weather was clear with no adverse atmospheric conditions. The roadways are constructed of bituminous asphalt.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GLS four door with two occupants, was southbound in the number four, left turn lane. A non-contact, southbound pickup truck changed lanes from the number one lane into the number four, left turn lane in front of V1. The driver of V1 was talking to her passenger about the unsafe maneuver and followed the pickup while making a left turn. The driver stated that she was focused on the turning truck and did not look for oncoming traffic. She stated she did not see vehicle two (V2) until the collision occurred. The vehicles were within 2 meters (6.5 feet) of each other at final rest positions. V1 was facing generally southbound and V2 was facing generally northeast. V1 was towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Saturn SL2 four door with one occupant, was northbound in the number two lane. V2 was traveling about 48 kmph (30 mph) approaching the intersection on a green light. The driver of V1 entered the intersection and saw the non-contact truck make a left turn in front of him. V1 then made a left turn in front of him and he said he did not have time to brake or avoid the crash. He said his front hit the right side of V1. V1 came to rest in the intersection facing south. V2 came to rest in the intersection facing northeast. V2 was not towed.
The driver of V1, an eighteen (18) year-old female, stated she and her thirteen-year-old sister had been at a local mall and were going home at the time of the crash. She was in the number four, left turn lane and saw a pickup cut across three lanes of traffic. The truck got in front of her and made a left turn on a green light. The driver of V1 said she and her sister were talking about why that movement was stupid and unsafe. She then said she was focused on that vehicle, followed it and also made a left turn. She stated she did not look far enough ahead for oncoming traffic and was struck by eastbound V2. Her home was only a few blocks from the crash. She stated her intention was to turn left at the intersection. She stated she was focused on the turn and did not see oncoming V2. She stated she drives on this roadway daily. She stated she was in good health, was wearing prescription contacts and had taken no medications. She stated she was not injured but had been checked by EMS personnel. This driver had slept nine and one half hours the night before in her residence. She stated she started driving at age sixteen and did not have any driver education. She said the reason for the crash was that she just wasn't paying attention.
The driver of V2, a twenty four (24) year old male had just left his home about 10 minutes before the crash and was going to work. He was driving in the number two eastbound lane about 48 kmph (30 mph). He saw the non-contact pickup make a left turn and it was immediately followed by vehicle one. This driver said he was listening to the radio but was not distracted. He said he just did not have enough time to react and avoid the crash. He stated he was using the lap and shoulder restraint and both airbags were deployed. He said he thought there might have been a fire because the vehicle filled with smoke. The smoke was found to be airbag residue and there was not a fire. He said he did not use the brakes. The driver of V2 stated he was in good health, did not require prescription glasses, and had taken no medications. He had slept thirteen (13 ) hours the night before.
