The crash occurred on an undivided two-lane, bituminous, rural road with a statutory speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday, morning crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 1993 Saturn SL2 4-door driven by a 46 year-old female, was westbound on the road negotiating a curve to the left, on a greater than 2 percent uphill slope. V1 crossed the double yellow centerline. The left side of V1 struck the left side of V2, and then struck the left side of the trailer towed behind V2, breaking off the left dual rear wheels. V1 continued moving westbound and the front of V1 struck the front of V3. V1 rotated counterclockwise while moving rearward, and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing southwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver was transported by helicopter to a local trauma center due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 was a 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup truck towing a 12 foot closed trailer loaded with 500 pounds of horseshoeing equipment. V2 was driven by a 61 year-old male on his way to work traveling eastbound at 55 mph negotiating a curve to the right with a 2 percent uphill slope. The driver stated that he noticed V1 drifting across the centerline a few seconds before the crash. The driver of V2 braked and steered to the right, and was almost completely onto the paved shoulder when struck by V1. V2 continued onto the grass and the driver steered back to the left and re-entered the road on the right. The trailer rolled one-quarter turn to the right in the shallow ditch, broke loose at the hitch and came to rest on the right shoulder on its right side facing south. V2 came to rest in the westbound lane facing northeast. V2 was driven from the scene after changing the left rear tire. The fully restrained driver denied injures at the scene.
V3, a 2006 Chrysler Town and Country minivan driven by a 49 year-old female, was eastbound on the road behind V2, the pick-up truck. The driver of V2 applied the brakes and steered to the right but the front of V3 was struck by the front of V1. V1 came to rest off the road on the right facing northeast. V3 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver was transported to a local hospital due to injuries.
A witness (not listed on PAR), traveling behind V1 stated that V1 was weaving left and right for miles prior to the crash and did not respond when the witness sounded her horn.
No Critical Pre-crash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to V3 because it was not involved in the first harmful event. The driver of V2 took prescription medications for the treatment of hypothyroidism and allergies.
