The crash occurred in the westbound left turn only lane of a suburban arterial road. The road ran east/west and had five lanes with a raised concrete median separating east and westbound directions of travel. The westbound lanes consisted of two through lanes and one left turn only lane. The road was intersected on the north side by a two lane, one-way interstate exit ramp that continued on the south side of the intersection as a two-lane, one-way access road to a business district. The intersection was controlled by traffic lights with no pedestrian signal. The arterial road was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 48kph/30mph. The crash occurred in the predawn hours of a weekend morning with clear skies.

Vehicle #2, a 1989 Ford Aerostar, was traveling ahead of the pickup (V1) in the left turn westbound lane. Vehicle #1 moved to the left turn lane and rear-ended Vehicle #2 while it was decelerating for a red light. Both vehicles came to rest facing west in the left turn only lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
