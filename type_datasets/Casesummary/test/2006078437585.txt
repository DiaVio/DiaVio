Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Dodge Dakota 4x4 pickup driven by a 46 year-old male with one passenger, was traveling westbound in the #2 lane approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Jeep Cherokee 4x2 driven by a 25 year-old female, was traveling eastbound and stopped in the left turn in the intersection. The traffic light turned red just as V1 entered the intersection. V2 then made a left turn to travel northbound. V1 skidded for about 15 meters (49 feet) before it impacted with V2. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in the intersection. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and travel in a northwesterly direction for about 3 meters (10 feet) before it came to rest in the intersection facing in a northwesterly direction. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and travel in a northwesterly direction for about 7 meters (23 feet) before it came to rest in the intersection facing in a northerly direction. The vehicles came to rest within 2 meters (7 feet) of each other. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The passengers from V1 and V2 were transported to a local medical facility.
