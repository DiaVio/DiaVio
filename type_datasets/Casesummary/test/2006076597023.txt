This single vehicle crash occurred on a 4 lane divided asphalt-constructed roadway. This roadway runs east to west and is divided with an extended dirt median. This roadway has various curves and grades. The vehicle departed the left side of the roadway on a left hand curve with a radius of 662-meters (2,172-feet) and a positive super elevation of 5%. The posted speed limit is 89 kmph (55 mph) and a downgrade of -6 %. This crash happened during daylight hours during a heavy rain. This roadway is fairly new with good visibility and no roadway defects noted.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Toyota Corolla sedan with a driver only, was westbound descending the grade and negotiating the left hand curve, when as the driver stated to the police officer, the vehicle lost traction and began to drift sideways. The driver tried to steer the vehicle back onto the roadway but it still went off the left road edge in a clockwise rotation into the center median. As V1 left the roadway it impacted a large tree with its left side. This impact caused V1 to rotate counter-clockwise where it then came to rest 8-meters (26-feet) south of this tree, heading in a southerly direction. The 19 year-old female driver was not injured and not transported. V1 was towed for disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver could not be located for an interview. The driver stated to the investigating officer that she felt the vehicle start to slide and she applied corrective steering then ran off the roadway into a tree. The crash occurred during a period of heavy rain and the vehicle hydroplaned before it ran off the left road edge. When the vehicle began to hydroplane, the driver lost all control over the vehicle.
