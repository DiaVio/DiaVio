The crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection. There were five lanes running east/west with lanes one and two being through lanes and with lane three being a turn lane. The north/south roadway was controlled by stop signs. The conditions were dry and clear on a weeknight evening, which was also a holiday. The roadway was level and the posted speed was 56 kph (35 mph).
V1 was a 1987 S-10 Chevy pick-up truck that was traveling westbound in lane three. The driver made a left turn in front of V2, a 1992 Ford Probe, that was traveling eastbound in lane two. V1 sustained right front damage and after impact spun counterclockwise coming to final rest off the roadway on the southeast corner. V2 tried to swerve to the right into lane one to avoid the truck but was unsuccessful and sustained front-end damage. No one was injured but V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 was cited for failure to yield right of way when making a turn and was charged with a DUI. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 37-year-old male who was driving home from his holiday dinner. The driver stated, "The green car just swerved at him". The driver's story was not believable as he was clearly intoxicated showing signs of slurred speech and unsteady gait. The driver was given a DUI test on-scene and failed. He was cited for the crash and was arrested for driving under the influence.
V2 was driven by an 18-year-old female who was traveling eastbound in lane two. She stated that she and her cousin had just left their aunt's holiday dinner and she was taking her cousin home. She stated that she was just driving along and was approaching the intersection when the truck turned right in front of her. She stated that she tried to quickly react by turning the wheel to the right, but still got hit. The driver was not injured . An associative factor related to this driver was that the car was her aunt's. The driver stated that she "always" drives the car as she lives with her so she was comfortable behind the wheel. The driver was arrested on scene, as she was not cooperating with the police on scene. She was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
