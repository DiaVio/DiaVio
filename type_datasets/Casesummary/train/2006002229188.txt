This crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the southbound lane of a three lane undivided roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one southbound lane and two northbound lanes (with one designated a right turn only lane) and featured a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions, but traffic was backed up due to rush hour conditions.
V1, a 2001 Dodge Caravan, was southbound in lane one when it failed to slow for traffic and impacted the rear of V3, a 2004 Honda Civic, which was stopped ahead of it. V2, a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer, was also southbound behind V1, and failed to stop for the collision ahead of it and subsequently struck the rear of V1. The force of this impact pushed all vehicles forward and the front of V3 struck the rear of V4, a 1997 Ford Escort Wagon, which was also stopped in lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

This driver denied inattention or conversation with passengers (four developmentally disabled adults who may have contributed as a distraction). This driver stated she did not have time to make any defensive actions. There were no injuries reported to any occupants in this vehicle. This Vehicle was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a belted 35-year-old female, who after numerous attempts, could not be contacted for an interview. There were no reported injuries for this driver and the vehicle was driven from the scene.
V3 was driven by a belted 68-year-old female who was transported to an area hospital, treated and released. This driver stated she was pushed into V4 by the force of the second impact. V3 was towed due to damage.
V4 was driven by a belted 59-year-old male who stated he was stopped in the traffic lane, waiting for vehicles to pass before making a left turn into a retail parking lot. He stated he made no avoidance actions, was not looking behind his vehicle and already had his foot on his brake.
