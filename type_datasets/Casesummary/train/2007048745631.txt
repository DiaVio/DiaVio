This two-vehicle crash occurred early afternoon on an eight-lane, level, straight, dry, bituminous, divided roadway. This roadway runs north to south and devotes four lanes to northbound traffic and four lanes to southbound traffic. This roadway intersects with a private drive to a convenience store. There was also a crossover in the median of the roadway. The posted speed limit for this roadway was 80 kmph (50 mph). The crash occurred in an area where traffic was backed up for a nearby traffic control light (on colors).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Pontiac G6 with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane four with the intention of turning left at the intersection to ender the private drive. Vehicle two (V2), 2003 Nissan Altima with two occupants, was traveling southbound in lane one. Traffic in lane one must turn right at the controlled intersection south of the collision. Traffic in southbound lanes two, three and four was backed up past the private drive. Southbound traffic in these three lanes had left a gap to allow V1 to complete the intended left turn into the driveway. As V1 completed the turn, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1. Both vehicles stayed together after impact. V2 was towed from the scene while V1 was driven. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V2 was a 22 year-old female who is a full time student. She was coming from lunch and was heading toward the interstate. This was her first time on the roadway and was driving her friend's vehicle. The vehicles stopped in traffic obscured her view of V1.
