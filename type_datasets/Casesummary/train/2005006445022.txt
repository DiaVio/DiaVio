This crash occurred in the evening with no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was dry. It took place on a two-lane undivided roadway that ran east/west. V2, a 2000 Dodge Stratus, was stopped at the traffic control device (a tri-color light without pedestrian crossing signs). V1, a 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling on the same roadway in the same direction, approaching V2 from behind. For an unknown reason, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was driven by a 43-year old female. V2 was driven by a 24-year old female. The interviews could not be obtained from either driver.
