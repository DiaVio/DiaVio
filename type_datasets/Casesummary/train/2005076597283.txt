This single vehicle crash occurred mid-morning during daylight hours in a rural area on an asphalt 4-lane roadway with an extended median. The southbound roadway consisted of 2 lanes and was separated from the 2 northbound lanes by a shallow uphill embankment 15 meters wide. The #1 lane had a downhill slope of -5.7% and a super-elevation of +4%. The #1 lane is bordered on the right by a dirt shoulder 2 meters wide, then an uphill embankment. It had been raining the entire night before th crash and continued to rain when the crash occurred, standing water was present in some uneven areas of the roadway. The speed limit 104 kph (65 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Nissan Altima 4-door sedan driven by a 24 year-old male was traveling southbound in the #1 lane when its front tires contacted a standing puddle of water. V1 began to hydroplane while rotating clockwise towards the embankment. The driver let off the gas pedal and steered left. V1's front tires then regained traction which caused the vehicle to suddenly rotate clockwise more violently and with its front end plane contacted the dirt embankment for a length of 3.5 meters before it separated from the embankment. V1 continued to rotate clockwise one complete time as it returned to the roadway and came to rest in the center of the southbound lanes facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
