This crash occurred on the right roadside of the two northbound lanes of a divided, bituminous roadway on a weekday evening. The straight, level, and dry roadway had a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions but the roadway was dark at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2006 Scion TC, was traveling north in lane two entering a tree-lined section of the roadway. As V1 attempted a sudden lane change into lane one, it lost control, and departs the roadway to the right. This vehicle contacted a small ditch and overturned two-quarter turns coming to final rest on its roof. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a 29 year-old male in good health, who was in the process of transferring a customer's vehicle from one dealership to another. He stated that a small, unidentified animal approached the roadway from the west tree line. He attempted to avoid a collision with it by braking and steering hard right. The driver of V1 was transported to a treatment facility with non-incapacitating injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
