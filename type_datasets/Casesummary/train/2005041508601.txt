The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, four-lane roadway, divided by a concrete curbed median. There were two northbound and two southbound lanes. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). Conditions were weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2004 Volvo V70 with one occupant, was traveling in lane one. V2, a 2001 Dodge Neon with one occupant, was stopped in lane one, far ahead of V1. As V2 slowly accelerated from a stopped position, V1 began to overtake V2. At the last minute, the driver of V1 attempted to steer left and brake. The right front of V1 made contact with the left rear of V2. The vehicles came to final rest next to each other. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
V1, the Volvo V70, was driven by a 58-year old female who reported no injuries. She stated that she was driving home from work, traveling at about 56 kmph (35 mph). She said that she didn't know exactly what happened - she didn't know why she didn't realize that V2 was stopped and misjudged its slow speed. The driver commented that not seeing any brake lights on the vehicle in front of her led her to believe that the vehicle was moving at a normal rate of speed. By the time she realized how slow V2 was moving, it was too late. She applied her brakes and steered left, but still made contact with the back of V2.
V2, the Dodge Neon, was originally driven by a 16-year old male with a learner's permit. The original driver of V2 had stopped in the traffic lane to let himself out for work. The original passenger of V2, a 50-year old female, then became the driver. She stated that she entered the vehicle through the driver's side door, put on her seatbelt, and put the vehicle in gear. She indicated that she was just beginning to accelerate, and was traveling at about 8 kmph (5 mph) when she was struck from behind.
