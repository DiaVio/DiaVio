This is a two-vehicle intersection crash that occurred early afternoon in daylight hours at a T-intersection that is controlled by a stop sign for southbound traffic. There are two westbound and two eastbound lanes that are separated by a continuous left turn lane. The speed limit on this roadway is posted 56 KPH (35 MPH). There is a single westbound/eastbound lane that has no centerline stripe to divide the lanes. The speed limit on this roadway is posted 40 KPH (25 MPH). The roadways are straight, level and constructed of bituminous asphalt. The roadway was dry and the sky was clear.
Vehicle one (V-1), a 2003 Toyota Corolla LE sedan driven by a 27 year-old male was stopped at the stop sign for about 10 seconds waiting to turn left to travel eastbound. Vehicle two (V-2), a 1999 Mercury Mountanieer 4X4 4dr driven by a 18 year-old female was traveling westbound in the #2 lane at about 56 kph (35 MPH). There was a Jeep (non contact vehicle) traveling westbound in the #1 lane also approaching the intersection. The Jeep began to slow down and turned its blinker on to turn right to travel north. This created a sight line restriction of V-2 for V-1. V-1 then began to make a left turn to travel eastbound across the path of V-2. The front of V-2 struck the left front area of V-1. The impact caused V-1 to rotate counterclockwise coming to rest in the #1 westbound lane facing west. V-2 was able to park the vehicle in a parking lot at the northwest corner of the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
