The crash occurred on the roadside of the northbound lanes of a two-way curved urban roadway that was not physically divided. The two bituminous northbound lanes were dry and level with a slight curve to the left. The conditions were dark but lighted with clear skies on a weekday night. V1, a 1994 Chevy Corsica, was traveling northbound in lane two when the driver dozed off causing the vehicle to veer off the right side of the roadway making contact with a residential concrete fence where it came to final rest.
V1 was driven by a 50-year-old male in good health despite the fact he had not slept in the previous 28 hours due to being assigned jury duty on top of working the graveyard shift. He does not remember anything prior to hitting the wall. He was transported to a local hospital with incapacitating injuries and his vehicle was towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
