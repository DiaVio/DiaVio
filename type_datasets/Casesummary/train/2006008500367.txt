This crash occurred at a T-intersection regulated by two stop signs. One stop sign regulated the southbound lane. The other stop sign regulated the traffic coming from the eastbound lanes that could turn either north or south. There were no regulations on northbound traffic. The southbound lane was straight, had a downhill grade of greater than 6 percent, and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The eastbound lane was straight, level, and had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Both roadways were bituminous. The roadways were dry and conditions were clear. The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon hours on a weekday.
V1 was a 1996 Subaru Legacy station wagon driven by a 66-year-old female. V2 was a 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck, driven by a 50-year-old male. V1 was traveling southbound in lane one approaching the T-intersection and did not stop for its stop sign. V2 was traveling eastbound and stopped for its stop sign. The driver of V2 looked both ways and noticed V1 traveling towards the intersection. Since V1 had a stop sign, V2 began to proceed into the intersection, intending on turning left and then traveling in the northbound lane. As V2 entered the intersection, V1 contacted it in the driver's side door. The collision caused V2 to roll one-quarter turn to the right and skid into the northbound lane where it came to final rest. The driver of V1 had attempted to apply her brakes and steer to the right but was unable to avoid the collision. After the vehicles made contact, V2 went off of the roadway to the right and went through a fence near the roadside where it came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
