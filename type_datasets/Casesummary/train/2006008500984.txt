The driver of V1 had fallen asleep while driving to her aikido class. There are multiple reasons for the severe fatigue of the driver. The driver had been working twelve hours per day for the previous three days, and her job had been extremely stressful. She had a high-pressure occupation and was handling multiple projects. Due to her long hours and heavy workload, she had been getting only 4 hours of sleep per night. Prior to these three days she was on vacation but was still continuing to complete work. She was also dealing with a death in her family, of a co-worker, and an acquaintance. The driver was also in a hurry to get to her class so that she could rest for a while before beginning. It should also be noted that this crash occurred less than half a mile from her destination.
