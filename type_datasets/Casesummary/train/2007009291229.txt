The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. There was one westbound lane and one eastbound lane with one-half meter high embankments on each side. This was a level, straight bituminous section of roadway approaching a right curve in the westbound direction. It was dawn, mid-week, the sky was clear and the road was wet with icy patches. Commuter traffic was moderate on this rural road with a posted speed of 40 kmph (25 mph).
V1 was a 2002 Mazda Tribute four-door sport utility driven by a 50-year old female. A witness who was traveling four car lengths behind V1 stated that both V1 and his vehicle were traveling west in lane one at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) when V1 hit an icy patch on the road. He saw the rear of V1 skid left clockwise as the vehicle appeared to accelerate until the front tires seemed to catch on something. V1 then traveled straight up the right side embankment, striking a tree with the front of V1. At impact, the rear of V1 lifted up while the vehicle continued to rotate clockwise. V1 then bounced twice onto the roadway, coming to final rest on the eastbound lane facing east. The driver's husband stated that the driver had left their home ten minutes prior to the crash and due to the frequency of incidents on this road, his wife was aware that caution was required. The driver was unconscious and transported due to injuries. She claimed that she does not remember any of the events leading up to, during, or after the crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The witness stated that when he went to assist the driver he found her cell phone closed and resting in the driver's side door compartment, leading him to believe that the driver was not using a cell phone at the time of the crash. The witness's vehicle also skidded on the same patch of ice and he stated that if V1 hadn't come to rest in the opposite lane, their vehicles would have collided.
