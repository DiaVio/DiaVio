The crash occurred at the roadside of a north/south bound two lane undivided roadway. There was one lane in each direction of the asphalt, straight, level, dry roadway, which had drainage ditches on either side of the road. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph). The crash occurred early on a weekend morning under clear skies and light traffic flow.
V1, a 1991 Honda Accord four door with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. The vehicle drove along the right edge of the roadway and then veered back to the left and across the roadway on the left side. It jumped the drainage ditch and struck the embankment on the opposite side of the ditch with its front left. It then rotated in a counterclockwise direction and rolled over to the right approximately six quarter turns. During the rollover sequence it struck and knocked down a fence and came to rest on its top facing east approximately 35 meters south and east of the roadway departure point in a dirt horse training field. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1, the Honda Accord, was driven by a 30-year old female who received non-incapacitating injuries and was transported to a hospital. The driver reported that she had driven about a mile, traveling at the speed limit, from a nearby motel on her way home. She said she was still a bit drowsy and felt the right tires hit the right edge of the road without going into the drainage ditch. She said she thought she hit the gas by mistake rather than the brakes and this caused her to veer to the left across the road to the left and off the left edge and ultimately roll over several times before coming to rest upside down.
