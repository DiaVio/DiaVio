The crash occurred on the south roadside of an eastbound exit ramp off a three-lane, interstate highway. There were three eastbound lanes with paved shoulders and a grass median on a slight left curve. A one-lane exit ramp extended off the right side of the highway. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph) and a 2% uphill grade approaching the exit ramp. The exit ramp itself was on level ground. Conditions were dark and dry with clear skies. The setting was late evening hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility negotiating a left curve in lane one. V1 began merging right into the exit ramp lane. A broken down vehicle was stopped partially on the lane and shoulder of the exit ramp. V1 swerved right and braked in avoidance of the stopped vehicle. V1 traveled off the right roadside and rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees. V1 then rolled right approximately two full turns, coming to rest on its wheels in the right roadside. Police Reported Travel Speed is 121 kmph for V1.
The Chevrolet Tahoe (V1) was driven by a 37-year old male who was transported with non-incapacitating injuries to a local trauma center. He stated that he was heading home from watching a professional hockey game. He was not expecting a stopped vehicle in his lane and lost control during avoidance. He was unsure of the number of rolls his vehicle underwent. He estimated his travel speed to be (104 kmph) 65 mph, and disagreed with the investigating officer's estimate of (120 kmph) 75 mph.
