The crash occurred at the intersection of two major roadways, controlled by traffic signals. The east/west street was a two-way, seven-lane roadway, divided by a concrete curbed median. The north/south street was a two-way, eight-lane roadway, divided by a concrete curbed median. These were straight, level, asphalt roads with a north/south posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) and an east/west posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). Conditions were dark with streetlights on a weekday evening. Skies were cloudy with intermittent rainfall.
V1, an unknown van with unknown occupants, was traveling a southbound lane. V2, a 1995 Ford Taurus with two occupants, was traveling northbound in lane four (left turn lane). Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the two vehicles reached the intersection, V2 attempted to make the left turn. V1, which was signaling to make a right turn, instead continued south through the intersection. As a result, the front of V1 made contact with the right rear of V2. V1 left the scene. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
V2, the Ford Taurus, was driven by a 17-year old female, who was not injured. Her parents declined to allow her to be interviewed.
