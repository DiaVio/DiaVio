This crash occurred on the southbound lanes of a five-lane undivided urban highway. There were three southbound lanes that included a left turn lane for the traffic signal-controlled intersection. Conditions were dark, but the roadway was illuminated and dry in the mid-evening hours on a weekend. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 48 KMPH (30 MPH) and the southbound lanes were straight and level. The crash occurred on a weekend during the hours of darkness.
Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Hyundai Accent 2-door hatchback driven by a 65-year old female. She was traveling in the first lane of travel, approaching a four-way intersection controlled by a traffic signal. V2, a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder was stopped for a red light in the same lane at the intersection ahead of V1. The driver of V1 stated that she looked to her left at a retail store while braking, thinking that V2 was quite a distance ahead of her. She estimated that she had enough room between her vehicle and Vehicle #2 as she slowed down to the intersection. She stated she probably didn't apply enough braking force, and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. The driver of V1 was wearing her lap and shoulder seatbelt. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V2 was a 23-year old male with a 29-year old passenger in the front right seat. Both driver and passenger stated they had minor injuries to the head/neck areas. The driver stated that he was at the intersection waiting for the light to change with one hand on the gearshift and one hand on the steering wheel. He had one foot on the accelerator pedal and one foot on the clutch pedal thereby indicating his brake lights were not engaged, possibly an associated factor in this crash. The driver and occupant were both restrained by lap and shoulder belts.
