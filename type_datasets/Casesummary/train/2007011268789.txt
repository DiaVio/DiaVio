The 2-vehicle crash occurred in the intersection of a 1 way, 4 lane, level, straight, bituminous, urban roadway and a 2-way, 3 lane, level, straight, bituminous roadway that intersected it in a non-90 degree angle. The intersection was controlled by cycling, traffic signals which turned into flashing yellow for the 4 lane road and flashing red for the 3 lane road at 2200 hours each day. At the time of the midweek, late-night crash the weather was clear, the roadways dry and the intersection was dark-unlighted. The posted speed limits for v1 were 56kmph (35mph) and 89kmph (55mph) for v2.
V1, a 1996 Ford Aerostar van occupied by a 21-year-old female driver, was westbound in lane 1 of the 3-lane roadway described above. V2, a 2003 Kia Sedona mini-van occupied by a 20-year-old male driver and a 31-year-old female passenger, was southbound in lane 3 of the 4-lane roadway described above. V1 had a flashing red light at the intersection, stopped briefly, saw v2 approaching the intersection from the right and proceeded straight across the intersection. V2 had a flashing yellow light and was maintaining a steady speed to go straight through the intersection without stopping. V2 saw v1 crossing the intersection. The driver of v2 braked and steered right but could not avoid v1. V1, front, impacted v2, front. The driver of v1 was injured and transported. Both vehicles were towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of v1 stated that she had just quit working afternoons to start school during the day full time. She had been traversing that intersection during the day for years but was not familiar with it late at night. She had been up since 0600 that morning and was going from a friend's house to see her boyfriend who was just about to get off work. She stopped at the blinking red light for a few seconds, saw v2 approaching from her right then proceeded across the intersection assuming that v2 had a red blinking light also. When she realized that he was not stopping it was too late to take adequate avoidance actions.
The driver of v2 stated that he was going 45-50mph in lane 3 and was going to go straight through the intersection when he saw v1 stop for the blinking red light for 1-2 seconds then proceed straight across the intersection at a “normal” pace. He thinks that the driver of v1 thought he had a to stop also. He braked and steered right but could not avoid impacting v1.
