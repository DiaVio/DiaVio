This crash occurred just past noon during daylight with good visibility and heavy traffic conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Toyota Pickup driven by a twenty four (24) year old female, was stopped at the south side entrance with intention of turning left to go west. As V1 waited for traffic to clear a very large truck, an Ford F-450 pickup truck, approached from the west in the #1 lane and executed a right hand turn into the south entrance road. The driver of V1 stated that she could see behind the turning truck and did not see any other vehicles, so she proceeded to enter this roadway turning left. Just as she started into the roadway she suddenly saw a truck coming from the west in the #2 travel lane. This truck was hidden behind the non-contact truck and came around as the non-contact truck was making its turn. V1 was impacted on the left side bed area and was spun around in the intersection and across the roadway. V1 was towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
Vehicle two (V2) was a 1997 Chevrolet pickup driven by a thirty (30) year old female with two passengers. V2 was eastbound in the #2 travel lane going the speed limit and right behind the non-contact truck when suddenly V1 crossed in front of V2. The driver stated that she had no time to avoid hitting V1 and that she had braked hard and steered right. V2 was towed from the scene.
