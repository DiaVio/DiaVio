The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, ten-lane, interstate roadway. There were five northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekend afternoon, with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal, with the exception of a disabled vehicle, which interrupted the traffic flow in lane four.
V1, a 1999 Nissan Altima with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane four. V2, a 1994 Infinity G20 with two occupants, was traveling ahead of V1, also in lane four. V2 started experiencing mechanical problems, and began to rapidly decelerate. V1 failed to slow down, rear-ending V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
V1, the Nissan Altima, was driven by a 26-year old male, who was transported with possible injuries. He stated that he was traveling home from work, and that traffic was flowing normally, at sixty to seventy miles per hour. Suddenly, there was a vehicle stopped on the interstate, in the driver's travel lane. The driver did not recall if the other vehicle had any hazard lights on. Traffic in the lane to the left of the driver prohibited him from making a lane change to the left, which led to the collision.
V2, the Infinity G20, was driven by a 24-year old male, who was transported with possible injuries. He stated that he started to have car trouble on the interstate. He heard a loud popping sound, as if a tire had blown. The driver said that he put on his emergency flashers and tried to get off the interstate by getting into the inside emergency lane, which was the closest emergency lane available to him. Due to faster moving traffic, the driver never made it out of his original travel lane. Approximately ten seconds after the car trouble began, the other car hit him from behind. The driver indicated that he was going approximately 64 kmph (40 mph) when he was hit.
