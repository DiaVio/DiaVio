This single vehicle crash occurred at a T-intersection of an unlit, two-lane, divided, concrete north/south road and an unlit 4-lane concrete state east/west highway. The intersection is controlled with a stop sign for the northbound traffic only. The two-lane road has a speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph), and is straight and level. The east-west bound roadway is straight, level and has a speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). This crash occurred on a hot, clear, dark weeknight in the late evening hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Mercedes 300 E sedan with one occupant, a 56-year-old male, was northbound in lane one. On approach to the T-intersection, the driver of V1 did not turn. Instead, he drove straight through the intersection, through a tall grassy field. The car then veered westbound, where it struck an embankment and dropped approximately 5 meters (16 feet) to final rest, facing west at the bottom of a steep ditch. Due to the terrain, rescue efforts took 45 minutes to extricate driver. Driver had been drinking since leaving work, about six hours prior to the crash, leading to impairment and no memory of the crash. Driver was transported with incapacitating injuries, and vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Driver had no recollection of crash or pre-crash events. Vehicle inspection found mouthwash in backseat and a Â½ empty gallon of vodka in the trunk.
