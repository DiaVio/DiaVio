V1 was a 1991 Nissan 240SX driven by a 29-year old male. V1 was traveling northwest on a 2-lane undivided roadway (one lane each direction). It was the early hours of the morning, on a clear night not long after midnight. The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph). The driver began to negotiate a left curve on a 4% downhill grade with a 6% negative superelevation. The car entered a counterclockwise skid. The driver applied the brakes and counter-steered to the right. The vehicle traveled off the left side of the roadway and rolled to the right approximately two and one-half complete turns, coming to rest on its roof on the left roadside. During the rollover a street sign was impacted with an unknown plane of the vehicle, and a large boulder was impacted with the right plane. The driver was uninjured, and EMS response was canceled by volunteer firemen before arriving on scene. The driver was able to exit the vehicle under his own power by kicking out a passenger window.
