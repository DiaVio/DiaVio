This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday in the middle of a suburban intersection. The intersection consisted of a north/south eight-lane divided roadway (four lanes in each direction) intersected by an east/west two-lane divided roadway and controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. The north/south roadway was bituminous, dry, and straight with a downhill grade of <2% in the northbound direction. The roadway featured a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2001 Ford Explorer with one occupant, was southbound in lane three approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V2, a 2005 Toyota Highlander with one occupant, was northbound approaching the same intersection where it intended to turn left. V2 turned in front of V1 as both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise 180 degrees before coming to final rest facing north in the middle of the intersection. The impact pushed V2 into the eastbound lanes of the intersecting roadway where it came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 47-year-old male, was transported due to non-incapacitating injuries. He stated that he was passing through the intersection at about 40 mph when V2 turned in front of him. He braked hard and steered to the right but could not avoid V2.
The driver of V2, a 46-year-old male, was transported due to non-incapacitating injuries. He had no recollection of the incident, just waking up in the hospital. Witnesses on scene and the driver of V1 informed this researcher that it appeared this driver was suffering from a seizure at the time of the crash. The driver did state that he had a history of seizures when he was younger.
