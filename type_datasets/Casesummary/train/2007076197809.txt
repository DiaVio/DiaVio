This two-vehicle crash occurred in a business area at the intersection of a 5-lane asphalt roadway with a 2-way center left turn lane and a business drive. The eastbound lanes are straight and downhill. The business entrance is straight and level. The speed limit for the roadway is 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred during lunch hour congestion. There were no adverse weather or road defects present.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Chrysler Sebring 2-door, was exiting a business drive beginning to turn left when it impacted with the right front end plane of vehicle two (V2), a 1987 Chevrolet Monte Carlo 2-door traveling east in the #2 lane. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the center turn lane facing east. V2 came to rest in the center turn lane facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, an eighteen (18) year-old male, was unable to be contacted.
The driver of V2, a thirty three (33) year-old male and his passenger, were on their way to deliver lunch to their girlfriend's work place after stopping at a fast food restaurant about 1.6 kilometers (one mile) away. They were traveling at a driver reported speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) in the #2 lane. A large truck was traveling in the same direction just ahead of them in the #1 eastbound lane. The driver of V2 stated the large truck passed by V1 and then V1 very quickly pulled out in front of him. He braked and steered left slightly and impacted the left front of V1. The driver of V2 drives this road daily but this was the first time driving this vehicle he borrowed from a friend while his was being repaired. He felt comfortable with the vehicle and felt it was in very good working condition.
A witness to the crash stated that V1 stopped at the exit for a few seconds then just pulled right out in front of V2 and that V2 never had a chance to avoid V1.
