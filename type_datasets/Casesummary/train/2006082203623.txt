This two-vehicle crash occurred near a driveway on a level, five-lane roadway. This roadway consists of two lanes in each direction and a center left turn lane and is curved (radius of curvature of 152 meters and superelevation is two percent) to the right in the northbound direction. The speed limit on this roadway is 64 kmph (40 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours and it was raining.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Ford Taurus, was northbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Freightliner tractor pulling a flatbed trailer, turned left from the driveway and was southbound in the center turn lane. V1 traveled into the turn lane and the front struck the left side of the trailer of V2. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a twenty-one-year-old male, was traveling with a twenty-year-old male relative, from his home to go out for breakfast. He was healthy, well rested and drives this route daily. This driver stated that he has tight schedules at work causing him some stress. He also stated that he was traveling "too fast" and when he applied the brakes to slow down for the curve, his vehicle slid on the wet pavement and traveled over the left lane line.
The driver of V2, a forty-eight-year-old male, provided only minimal information. He stated that he always pulls out into the center turn lane to accelerate to merge with traffic. He further stated that he looked both directions before leaving the driveway and saw V1 but thought that it was traveling the speed limit, giving V2 enough time to enter the roadway safely. His vehicle was completely in the turn lane at the time of the crash.
