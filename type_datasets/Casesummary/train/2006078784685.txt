This is a two-vehicle crash that occurred at mid-afternoon hours in the eastbound lanes of a 5-lane, undivided, bituminous, urban roadway. There were two westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes with a common center turn lane. This was a straight, level roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was early afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was very light and there were no traffic controls for east/west traffic.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Saturn four door sedan driven by a 19 year-old female with one passenger, was initially stopped for a stop sign on an intersecting two-lane roadway controlled by a stop sign. V-1 was making a left turn from the stop sign, entered the number one westbound lane and accelerated to about 56 kmph (35 mph). The driver stated that the ignition key fell out and onto the floor. The driver attempted to find the key, failed to control the vehicle, and continued turning left across the eastbound traffic lanes, across the path of V-2. Vehicle two (V2), a 1976 Chevrolet Nova four door sedan driven by a 19 year-old male with three passengers was traveling east in the number one lane at a speed of about 56 kmph (35 mph). The driver of V-2 saw V-1 crossing toward him and attempted to avoid by hard braking with lockup. The attempt was not successful and the front ommf V-1 struck the right side of V-2. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate. V-1 rotated counterclockwise, struck and crossed the curb and came to rest facing southeast on the sidewalk. V-2 rotated clockwise and came to rest against the curb and still on the roadway. The vehicles came to rest within three meters. Both vehicles were towed from the scene no reported injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
