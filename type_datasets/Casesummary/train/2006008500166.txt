This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a five-lane highway divided by a concrete median barrier. There were three southbound lanes and two northbound lanes. This was a straight, bituminous roadway, with an uphill grade of 3 percent. The posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph). It was in the early afternoon on a weekday and conditions were clear.
V1 was a 2002 Ford Escape driven by a 42-year-old male. V2 was a 2002 Ford Taurus driven by a 31-year-old female. Both vehicles were traveling southbound. V1 was in lane two and V2 was in lane one. V1 was overtaking V2 at a high rate of speed when it changed lanes into lane one, contacting the left rear of V2. V2 spun 180 degrees and came to final rest in its original travel lane facing in a northwest direction. V2 skidded off of the roadway to the right while rotating in a clockwise direction. After the vehicle departed the paved roadway, its left side tires dug into the soft ground and tripped. This sent V2 into a left roll. The vehicle landed on its roof and slid to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 153 kmph for V1 and 153 kmph for V2.
