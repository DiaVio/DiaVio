This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on the southern roadside of a two-way, two-lane undivided roadway. The bituminous east/west roadway featured a slight curve left (in the eastbound direction) that sloped downhill (-5% slope) as it straightened out. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 88kmph (55 mph). Traffic flow was normal and the roadway was wet from a rain that was failing at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Ford Explorer XLT sport utility, was eastbound negotiating the curve left. As V1 continued the to negotiate the curve a westbound non-contact vehicle drifted into V1's travel lane. V1 swerved right to avoid the oncoming vehicle and briefly departing the roadway. V1 then returned to the roadway, lost control, as it overcorrected to the right and departed the roadway again to the right. V1 rotated clockwise 90 degrees and stuck a pile of large rocks with its left side tires as well as a mailbox with its left plane. V1 overturned three quarter turns to the left and came to rest on its right side on the south roadside. During the tow and recovery, the rollback tow truck imparted significant roof damage to V1 while attempting to turn the vehicle upright. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 43 year-old male who was uninjured. He stated that he was heading home from work when another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction drifted into his lane, forcing him to swerve right and lose control. He estimated his travel speed to be 80kmph (50 mph). The sport utility was towed due to damage.
