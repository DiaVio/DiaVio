This crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a five-lane, two-way, dry asphalt roadway. There were two southbound lanes and two northbound lanes divided by a two-way left turn lane. The bituminous roadway curved left and featured a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was late evening and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic was flowing.
V1, a 2005 Chrysler Sebring four-door with two occupants, was westbound in lane one negotiating the curve. The passenger of V1 thought the driver was traveling too fast and jerked the wheel; the driver over-steered in the opposite direction causing the driver to lose control. V1 spun counter-clockwise and its left side struck a concrete traffic barrier before coming to final rest in the roadway facing southeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 58-year old female, reported no injuries. She had just left her daughter in law's house and was on her way home. She was currently taking Vicodin and Lexapro, as well as mourning her boyfriend who recently passed away. She also claimed that she had been drinking that night. She stated that she had been traveling between 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph) prior to her son jerking the wheel. She believed her son thought that she had fallen asleep behind the wheel (which she done in the past). She attempted to brake but could not avoid contacting the barrier.
