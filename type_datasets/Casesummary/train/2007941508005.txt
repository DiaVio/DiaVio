The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a seven-lane roadway that was divided by a concrete curbed median. There were three westbound lanes and four eastbound lanes with a posted speed of 64 kmph (40 mph). This was a straight, level asphalt road. Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was interrupted by a disabled vehicle (V2) in the roadway.
V1, a 2002 Honda Accord sedan with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane three. V2, a 1997 Plymouth Neon sedan with one occupant, was stopped in lane three, ahead of V1. V2 had run out of gas. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The Honda Accord (V1) was driven by a 29-year old female, who refused treatment on-scene. She stated that she had just left her house. She was going to stop at a gas station on her way to work. The driver realized that she didn't have her seatbelt on, and began reaching for it. The motorist indicated that she briefly took her eyes off the road so that she could see what she was doing. When she looked up, she was within ten meters of V2, which was stopped in front of her. For a moment she thought about changing lanes to the right. Another vehicle in that lane prevented her from doing so. The driver said she slammed on the brakes and hoped for the best.
The Plymouth Neon (V2) was driven by a 48-year old male who was transported to the hospital due to injury. He stated that he was on his way home from work when he ran out of gas. The driver walked to the nearest gas station and brought back a can of fuel. When he had finished filling up, he got back inside his car and started it. As he put the car in gear, but before he had let his foot off the brake, he got hit from behind.
