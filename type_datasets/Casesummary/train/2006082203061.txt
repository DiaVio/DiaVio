This two-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours at a traffic signal-controlled intersection of a seven-lane north/south roadway and a parking lot access road. The eastbound access road is straight, level, one-way and consists of two lanes, one marked for right turn only and the other marked for left turn only. The roadway was dry and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. The speed limit for this access road is 24 kph (15 mph).
Vehicle one, a 2005 BMW Z4, was traveling eastbound in the right lane of the access road. Vehicle two, a 1992 Kenworth tractor/trailer, was stopped eastbound in the left lane, just behind the stop line. When the traffic signal turned green, the driver of vehicle one attempted to move left in front of vehicle two to turn left. At the same time, vehicle two began to turn left. The front of vehicle two struck the left side of vehicle one. Both vehicles came to rest prior to entering the north/south roadway. Vehicle one was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of vehicle one, a seventy-year-old female, was driving from work to lunch. She was well rested and was familiar with her vehicle and her route. She stated that she often sees tractor/trailers parked to unload their cargo in this area and that she has had to drive around them to get in to the left turn lane in front of them. She was not aware that the driver was in the vehicle and was leaving the loading dock area. She made her attempt to turn left from the right lane, which is clearly marked for right turns only.
The driver of vehicle two, a forty-six-year-old male, was driving from a delivery to another job site. He had been driving this class of vehicle for twelve years and was very comfortable with his vehicle. This driver travels this route on a monthly basis. He did not see vehicle one prior to the impact due to the design of his vehicle; vehicle one was in his blind spot.
