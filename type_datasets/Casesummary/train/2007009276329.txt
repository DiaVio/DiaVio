This crash occurred in the early evening of a weekday in the eastbound lanes of a divided four-lane highway. The east/west highway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a ditched, rock-filled median. The bituminous, straight, and level roadway featured a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The roads were wet from a freezing rain and light snow that was falling at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2001 Chrysler Concorde with one occupant, was eastbound in lane two. V2, a 2004 Volvo S40 with one occupant, was also eastbound in lane two ahead of V1. V1 was traveling at a rate of speed significantly fast than that of V2. V1 moved into lane one to pass V2. V2 suddenly moved over into lane one and the front of V1 struck the right rear corner of V2. The driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle and V2 departed the roadway onto the median and drove over the large rocks before coming to final rest. V1 also lost control due to the roads and spun around about 170 degrees and came to a rest in lane two. V1 was driven away while V2 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
The driver of V1, a 17-year-old male was uninjured in the crash. He stated that he was driving in lane two when he decided to change over into lane one. As he entered the lane V2 just suddenly jumped over into lane one as well. He said he struck V2 in the rear and lost control of his vehicle.
The driver of V2, a 61-year-old female, was injured in the crash. She stated that she was traveling down lane two at a slow rate of speed because of the bad road conditions. She said that V1 approached her from behind at a higher speed. She then decided to switch lanes over into lane one so V1 could pass. She said she never looked before she attempted her lane change.
