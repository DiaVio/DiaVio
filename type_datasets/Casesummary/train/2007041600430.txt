This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday on a high-occupancy, high volume, high-speed interstate. There were five lanes running southbound with lane five designated as a HOV lane. The roadway was flanked on each side by paved emergency shoulders. On the right hand side of the roadway there was a metal guardrail. The conditions were cloudy and rainy on a weekday night. The posted speed was 105 kmph (65 mph).
V1, a 2006 Lincoln Mark LT with two occupants, was northbound in lane three. The roads were slippery as it was raining that evening. The driver of the truck attempted to change lanes to the right ass she approached her exit. The driver steered hard right and the vehicle began to rotate clockwise. V1 then departed the roadway to the right and struck the metal guardrail. The truck came to final rest facing south in lane two of the northbound lanes. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 26-year-old female, was returning home with her father from a restaurant. She stated that she was attempting to make a lane change to the right when she saw a phantom vehicle in her intended lane. She got nervous and jerked the wheel back into her lane and lost control of her truck due to the slippery, wet roads. She also told this researcher that the truck was her parent's and she rarely drives it. She was cited for the crash for failure to use due care and traveling too fast for conditions.
