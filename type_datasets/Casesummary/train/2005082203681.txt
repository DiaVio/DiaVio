This two vehicle daytime collision occurred during the mid to late afternoon hours. The crash occurred at a driveway intersecting a six- lane undivided roadway. The pre-crash roadway for both vehicles is straight, level dry with bituminous paving. The six-lane roadway with a center turning lane has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The drive way has a stop sign with no posted speed limit.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Chevrolet K-1 pickup truck driven by a 26 year-old male with one passenger, was stopped at the stop sign waiting to turn left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Hyundai Elantra driven by a 26 year-old female, was heading north in lane two. V1 proceeded into the roadway to turn left, after he saw a box truck and van slowing to enter the parking lot that the driver of V1 was pulling out of. V1's sight line to V2 was not clear due to the location of the box truck. As V1 pulled out V2 impacted the left side of V1 with V2's front. Both drivers stated they did not see each other. V1 stated he did look but did not see V2 coming, and that she must have been in a blind spot due to the box truck. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
