The crash occurred at an intersection in the northbound lanes of a three-lane, urban roadway with a concrete median. There were two northbound lanes, a north-facing left turn lane, and two southbound lanes. The intersection was signal-controlled with pedestrian lights and crosswalks. The roadway had a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) and a 1% downhill grade in the northbound direction. The westbound approach had a 2% uphill grade. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was midday on a weekday.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Saab 9-5 sedan, was stopped facing north at the intersection waiting to turn left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Dodge Intrepid sedan, was northbound in lane two approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. As the light changed V1 began its left turn at the same moment V2 entered the intersection. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2. Both vehicles traveled a short distance and came to rest in the intersection north of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 56-year old female, was treated on scene for unknown injuries. She refused to be interviewed both on scene and on the phone several weeks after the crash. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 40 kmph (25 mph) and 48 kmph (30 mph), respectively. The Saab sedan was towed to the owner's residence due to damage.
The driver of V2, an 18-year old female was uninjured in the crash. She stated that she was heading from school to work when V1 pulled out into the intersection from the right. She braked and swerved left but could not avoid the collision. Her estimated travel and impact speeds were 72 kmph (45 mph) and 64 kmph (40 mph), respectively. The Dodge sedan was towed due to damage.
