A two vehicle daytime collision occurred during daylight hours on a Saturday morning. The collision occurred at the intersection of a two lane two-way arterial street and a one-way arterial street. Both streets are straight and level in the pre-crash directions. The two-way street is paved with concrete, and the one-way street is paved with asphalt before and after the intersection. The speed limit for the both roads is 48 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 1999 Dodge Dakota pickup, was stopped at the light facing north in lane three, with a driver and a passenger. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2001 Toyota Solara coupe, was heading east in lane two with only a driver. V1 entered the intersection against the red light, and a non-contact vehicle heading east in lane one stopped short of a collision with V1. V2 passed this stopped vehicle, and its front plane impacted with V1 in the left side rear of the pickup cab. Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection, and both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V2, a 22-year-old male, described seeing the other non-contact vehicle in the adjacent travel lane stop suddenly, and believed that he skidded into the side of V1. There were no visible skid marks, and the researcher was unable to determine if V2 was equipped with ABS. The driver of V1, a 28-year-old male, stated that he saw a car on his right begin to move forward, and took that as a sign that the light was green. The driver of V1 was distracted when entering the intersection by dialing his cell phone, and realized that a crash was imminent after seeing the other non-contact vehicle stop quickly on his left. The driver also indicated that he was conversing with his passenger prior to the crash.
