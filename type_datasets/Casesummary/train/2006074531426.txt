This two-vehicle crash occurred at the intersection of a straight, dry roadway and a driveway on the right side. This roadway has five lanes - two lanes in each direction and a dedicated left-turn lane. Also, there is a short right-turn lane for entrance into the driveway. The eastbound lanes have a 3% uphill grade. The speed limit on this roadway is 72 kmph (45 mph). The driveway is divided by a curbed median with shrubbery. There are two lanes for exiting this driveway. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of this crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Nissan Altima, was eastbound in lane two. V2, a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier, was northbound, exiting the driveway, intending to turn left (westbound) on the roadway. The traffic in lane one stopped due to traffic conditions. The lead vehicle driver signaled the driver of V2 that it was clear to exit the driveway. V2 entered the roadway and the front struck the front of V1. Both vehicles came to rest east of the crash and were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a fifty-five-year-old male, was on his way home for his lunch break from work. He was well rested and very familiar with his vehicle and his route. He takes an unspecified medication for high blood pressure. He noticed V2 at the last minute and applied the brakes in a futile attempt to avoid a collision.
The driver of V2, a twenty-five-year-old female, had just stopped to pick up lunch and was on her way back to work. An interview with this driver was started at the hospital, but, during subsequent attempts, she refused to provide any further information. No information is available regarding this driver's health, familiarity with the route and vehicle or any distractions.
