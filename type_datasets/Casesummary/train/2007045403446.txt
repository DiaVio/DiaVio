The crash occurred in the intersection of two residential streets. The north-southbound road had no lane markings but was one lane in each direction. It was asphalt, straight, dry, with a +8% slope from north to south. There were stop signs posted on the north-south bound road but no traffic controls for the east-west bound road. The east-west bound roadway was one lane in each direction and was asphalt, straight, level and dry. The posted speed limit was 48kph (30mph). Traffic was light on a bright sunny weekday just after noon.
V1, a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis four-door with one occupant, was southbound in lane one. V2, a 2005 Pontiac Grand Am four-door with one occupant was eastbound in lane one. V1 approached the intersection traveling uphill towards a stop sign and entered the intersection where it's right front struck the left rear of V2 causing it to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction. V1 stopped on the opposite side of the intersection still southbound about 10m from the point of impact. V2 yawed and came to rest facing west about 15m from the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Mercury Grand Marquis, was driven by an 83-year old female who was not injured. She refused to talk to the researcher until her son arrived and he also refused. Based on the scene evidence, V1 approached the stop sign and entered the intersection. It is unknown if V1 stopped before it entered the intersection and struck V2.
V2, the Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a 50-year old female who was coded for no injury but was transported to a hospital. The driver reported that she was traveling about 48kph (30mph) in route home from a relative's home. She said that as she approached the intersection she suddenly saw V1 entering from the north. She did not know if V1 stopped first. She advised that she braked without lockup and veered slightly to the right trying unsuccessfully to avoid V1 which struck her.
