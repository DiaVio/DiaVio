This crash occurred on the southern roadside of a two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The bituminous roadway curved to the right and featured an uphill grade. It was late evening on a weekday, it had been raining/snowing and the roadway was wet.
V1, a 1993 Ford Probe with one occupant, was eastbound negotiating the curve. V1 failed to remain under control, lost traction and began rotating clockwise. As the vehicle continued rotating, it left the roadway on the right side and sheared through a telephone pole. After contacting the telephone pole the vehicle rolled over six quarter turns. During the rollover the vehicle slid on its roof and contacted a curb on its left side. The vehicle came to final rest on it roof in a field. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 25-year-old male, suffered minor injuries but refused transport. He stated that as he negotiated the curve he suddenly lost control of his vehicle and started to rotate. He originally claimed that something on his vehicle possibly the sway bar broke and than claimed black ice. Neither claim could be proven as no black ice was found and vehicle damage prevented investigation of the sway bar.
