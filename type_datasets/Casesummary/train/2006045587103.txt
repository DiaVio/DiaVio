The crash occurred in the morning of a weekday on a north/south six-lane divided (concrete barrier) urban interstate. The highway consisted of three lanes and right shoulders in each direction. The far right (1st) lane served as an exit only lane. Recent traffic counts indicate the six interstate lanes carry 55,988 vehicles per day in the crash area. The road made a sharp curve to the right in the southbound direction (radius of curvature of 258m). It had a negative grade of 2% with a super elevation gradually increasing through the curve from 4% at pre crash to 8% at final rest. The interstate had been recently repaved; there have been several high profile crashes on the curve, which is notorious during inclement weather. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and wet on a weekend morning. Rain had stopped falling approximately 45 minutes prior to the crash. The speed limit was 89kmph (55mph) but curve warning signs advising 72kmph (45mph) were present.
V1, a 2000 Nissan Altima, was southbound in lane two of the interstate. As the vehicle negotiated the sharp curve to the right the driver lost control, departing the left side of the travel lanes and striking the center concrete barrier wall with its front left. V1 rode up the wall and rolled over right two-quarter turns. During the rollover it also contacted the top of the barrier wall with its left side. V1 came to final rest on its top facing west in the 3rd lane 48m (157ft.) from the initial wall impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 59 year-old female who was on her morning commute to work. In her interview she stated that the vehicle hydroplaned and she lost control. She was familiar with the area and the vehicle. She was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
