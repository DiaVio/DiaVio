This crash occurred in an intersection of two, two-way roadways. The north and southbound roadway was controlled by stop signs, and the east and westbound roadway was uncontrolled. The north/south roadway was straight and level, and the westbound roadway was level and curved to the left. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 40 kmph (25 mph). The weather conditions at the time of the crash were clear and sunny, and the roadways were dry.
V1, a 1999 Buick Century driven by an 80-year old male, was traveling southbound approaching the intersection, and for unknown reasons didn't stop at the stop sign. The vehicle continued into the intersection, where it was struck by V2. V2, a 1990 Cadillac DeVille, was traveling westbound approaching the same intersection. The driver of V2, a 43-year old male, observed V1 approach the stop sign and slow, but not stop. He stated that V1 then accelerated into the intersection. When he saw this, he reported that he "stomped" on his brakes and steered left; however, the front of V2 struck the left front of V1. After this impact, V2 rotated in a counterclockwise direction and the right side of V2 "slapped" the left side of V1. V1 continued in a southerly direction and its front then impacted a utility pole on the southwest corner of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
