The crash occurred off the north-side road edge of a two lane undivided roadway. This was a 5/61 (8%) uphill grade approaching a right hand curve. It was nighttime on a week-night, the road was dry and skies were clear. Traffic was very light.
V1, a 1995 Ford Contour sedan with one occupant, was traveling east up the hill when the occupant began to feel extreme menstrual cramps that caused her to lose focus on the road and swerve to the left. The vehicle left the road surface and contacted a retaining wall, wooden trellis/ gateway, and a large diameter tree. The vehicle came to rest in front of the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
V1, the Ford Contour, was driven by a 33 year old female who reported no injuries. She advised she was on her way home from work traveling up the hill when she got very bad cramps. She looked down at her stomach and that's when the vehicle left the road on the north side and hit the tree.
