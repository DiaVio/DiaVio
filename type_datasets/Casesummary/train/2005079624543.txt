This two-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a weekend. The crash occurred at a tri-light controlled, four-leg intersection. Both intersecting roadways are designated 56 kmph (35 mph) zones. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the concrete roadway in the intersection was in generally poor repair, marked by large cracks and uneven spots. The view of westbound and southbound crossing traffic is partially blocked by a building on the northeast corner of the intersection.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Saturn SL2 four-door sedan, was traveling southbound in the second lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, concrete roadway, approaching an intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu, was traveling westbound in the second lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. The east/west bituminous roadway becomes concrete as it intersects the north-south concrete roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
As both vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. Both vehicles rotated counter-clockwise and deflected southwest. Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection near the southwest corner.
