A two vehicle daytime collision occurred shortly after noon during daylight hours on a Tuesday. The collision occurred on a four-lane two-way arterial street where it intersects with a side street. Both roads are straight, level, and paved with concrete. At the intersection, the side street has a stop sign, but there are no control devices for the arterial road. The speed limit for the arterial road is 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 2003 Ford F150 pickup, was stopped on the side street waiting to turn left. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1998 Ford Windstar minivan, was headed south in lane two. V1 turned left from the stop sign, striking the front of V2 with the left front corner of V1. This pushed V1 to the right and in a clockwise rotation, with the front of V2 scraping down the left side of V1. Both vehicles were towed from the scene, but neither driver was transported to the hospital for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The drivers of both vehicles agreed that there was a transit bus stopped just north of the intersection in lane one discharging passengers at the northwest corner of the intersection. This bus created a sight line problem for both drivers. The bus prevented V2 from seeing V1 pull from the side street, eliminating enough reaction time for an avoidance maneuver from V2. The driver of V1 stated that the bus driver had waved him ahead to make his left turn. According to a witness listed in the police report, the witness stated that she did not see the bus driver wave V1 into traffic.
