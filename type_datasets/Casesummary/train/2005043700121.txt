The crash occurred in the southwest-bound lane of a two-lane, rural roadway. The southwest-bound lane curved to the right and had a 6% downhill grade. There was a left curve coming from both directions approaching the area of the crash. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The crash occurred in the early morning hours of a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe. Vehicle two was a 1993 Honda Accord sedan. V1 was traveling east negotiating a left curve. V2 was traveling southwest completing a left curve and approaching a right curve. V1 crossed the center line as it negotiated the left curve. The left side of V1 struck the left side of V2. V2 rotated counter-clockwise 180 degrees, coming to rest in a ditch off the right roadside. V1 came to rest in the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 32-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with no reported injuries. She was unable to be located for an interview. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 72 and 48 kmph (45 and 30 mph). V1 was reported driveable despite sustaining moderate damage and being towed from the scene. It was thus not towed due to police-reported damage.
V2 was driven by a 67-year old male who was uninjured. He stated that he was heading to a friend's workplace when another vehicle veered into his lane. He estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 48 kmph (30 mph). V2 was reported driveable despite sustaining moderate damage and being towed from the scene. It was therefore not towed due to police-reported damage.
