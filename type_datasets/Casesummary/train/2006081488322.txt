A four vehicle daytime collision occurred shortly after noon on a Saturday. The collision occurred in the four northbound lanes of a divided highway, in lane two. The pre-crash roadway for both vehicles is a straight and level, concrete roadway. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 97 kmph (60 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Chevrolet G-30 1-ton Coach Conversion van, was behind vehicle two (V2). V2, a 1995 Jeep Cherokee 4-door SUV was behind vehicle three (V3). V3, a 2002 Honda CRV 4 door, was behind vehicle four (V4), a 1992 Toyota Previa minivan. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V4 was traveling northbound in lane two ahead of V3, when V4 came to a fast stop. Apparently an uninvolved vehicle, a 2005 Ford F-150 pick-up truck, dropped a piece of furniture from the bed of the truck. This chair was not secured properly and traveled into the number two travel lane. The driver of V4 came to a sudden stop and avoided contacting the chair. V3 and V2 decelerated behind V4 nearly to a stop. The driver of vehicle one applied a full ABS application in an attempt to avoid the collision, however the front of V1 impacted the rear of V2. V2 was pushed forward impacting the rear of V3. The front of V3 impacted the rear of V4. V1, V2, V3 were all towed due to damage. V4 was driven from the scene.
