This single vehicle crash occurred at mid-afternoon during daylight hours at a T-intersection. The location was a rural two lane, level, bituminous, undivided roadway with paved shoulders on both sides. The weather was clear with excellent visibility, but the road was wet from moisture. The speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The roadway runs east/west and a roadway extends north at the intersection where the crash occurred.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Explorer Sport 4X4 two door, was traveling eastbound approaching a T-intersection with the intention of making a left turn. The driver, a 23-year-old male, initiated the left turn but was traveling too fast and slid off the right side of the roadway. The vehicle crossed a ditch and the front left corner struck a tree before coming to rest against the tree. There was no evidence of acceleration or braking marks on the roadway at the scene. V1 was towed from the scene and the driver refused treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
