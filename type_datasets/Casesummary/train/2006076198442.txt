Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Dodge Ram pickup was southbound in the first lane when it steered right to avoid vehicle two (V2) which was rapidly decelerating in front in the same lane. The rear left side plane of vehicle one contacted the rear end plane of V2, a 2004 Jeep Cherokee. V2 was slowing very quickly to avoid a pedestrian who was crossing the travel lanes from the right to the left. The pedestrian was the driver of vehicle three (V3), a 2002 Honda Odyssey mini-van that was parked on the right side paved shoulder of the southbound lanes. After the impact with V2, V1 departed the first lane and with its front-end plane contacted the rear end plane of V3. V1 then departed the road edge and struck the embankment edge with its front-end plane and came to rest. V2 continued forward and was impacted on its right side plane by the front left corner of V3 which had rotated counter-clockwise after the impact with V1. V2 came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder. V3 came to rest on the right shoulder. V1 and V3 were towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene.
