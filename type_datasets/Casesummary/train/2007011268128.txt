The crash occurred at the intersection of two, two-way, level, bituminous roads with a statutory speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). The roadways were one lane in each direction with additional left turn lanes at the west and north legs. A red flashing signal and stop signs for the east/west traffic controlled the intersection. Conditions at the time of the weekday afternoon crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2000 Saturn SLI 4 door sedan was driven by a 73 year-old male on his way from home to meet friends at a restaurant. The driver stated that he was east bound on the road and as he approached the intersection a car was 'parked' in lane one as if to turn right but he could see any driver in it. This was determined to be a vehicle turning right at the corner. The driver of V1 pulled past that vehicle and stopped for 3-4 seconds. The witness stated that the vehicle turned right and V1 was stopped for 20 seconds before he pulled out in front of V2. The driver stated he looked left and right and then proceeded straight across intersection. He never saw V2 coming and took no avoidance maneuvers. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V1 rotated counter clockwise and came to rest facing southwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver sought medical treatment following the crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 2 door extended cab pick up truck was driven by a 51 year-old male on his way home from work.

Following the impact V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing northeast in the intersection. V2 was driven from the scene. The driver of V2 denied injuries at the scene.
