The crash occurred on a 4-lane roadway that was divided by a grassy median and a guardrail. There were two lanes northbound and two lanes southbound. The crash occurred in the northbound lanes. The roadway was bituminous with a slight curve to the left and a superelevation of about 2 percent. The posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph). The roadway was wet from an earlier rain. It was the mid afternoon on a weekday. Traffic flow was light.
V1, a 2006 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan, was driven by a 21-year-old female who was traveling by herself. V1 was traveling in lane two when the driver made a sharp steering maneuver to the left and skidded off the left side of the roadway onto the median. The right side of V1 impacted the guardrail, bounced off the guardrail, rotated clockwise, and rolled once to its left. The driver stated that a non-contact SUV began to encroach into her lane from the right and she jerked the wheel to the left to avoid it. This maneuver, combined with the wet road caused her to lose control and she skidded off the road and into the guardrail. After striking the guardrail, V1 turned clockwise about 30 degrees and then rolled over onto its left side as it slid down the grassy median. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
