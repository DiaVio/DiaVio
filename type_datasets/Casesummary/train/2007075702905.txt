Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Volkswagen Jetta with one occupant, was northbound in lane two, approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Ford Taurus with one occupant, was stopped at the intersection, eastbound in lane three. The traffic signal indicated a green light for eastbound traffic and the driver of V2 proceeded into the intersection. V1 entered the intersection at the same time. Neither driver saw the other vehicle in time to execute any serious avoidance actions, and the front of V2 impacted the front left of V1. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest against the curb facing north-northeast on the northeast corner of the intersection. V2 rotated 180Â° counterclockwise and came to rest facing west in the middle of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a seventy-eight-year-old female, was coming from a recreation center and was on her way to a mall.

She stated she doesn't have any pre-existing health conditions, but medical records indicate she takes Norvasc, Diovan, and Hydrochlorothiazide on a daily basis for treatment of hypertension. She said she thought she had the green light and all of a sudden there was another car in the intersection.
