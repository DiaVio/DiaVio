This crash occurred in the early morning hours of a weekend in the eastbound lanes of a fully controlled urban highway, with two lanes in each direction divided by a concrete median barrier, with a posted speed limit of 113kmph (70 mph). The bituminous, wet roadway was straight and level except for a sag in the left lane (lane two). This sag in combination with a blocked storm drain allowed a puddle to form across all of lane two. Conditions at the time of the crash were dark and raining, with light traffic. Interviews were obtained with both drivers on-scene and both vehicles were inspected.
V1, a 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix, was eastbound in lane one traveling at 113kmph (70 mph). V2, a 1998 Ford Escort station wagon, was also eastbound in lane one ahead of V1 traveling at 97kmph (60 mph). As V1 approached V2 it began moving into lane two just before the sag in an effort to pass V2. V1 began to hydroplane on the road when she entered the 10m long area of standing water, and began to rotate counterclockwise. The driver steered hard right and V1 rotated clockwise causing the front of V1 to strike the left back of V2. The driver of V1 then steered left, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise again, spinning around completely as it crossed lane one before exiting the road on the right side. V1 than rolled backwards into the ditch that ran parallel to the roadway. V1 came to rest in the ditch facing north and was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 19 year-old female driving her mother's brand new vehicle for the second time. The fully restrained driver and her mother who was the front right passenger, refused treatment at the scene. Both airbags deployed, and the Intelligent Communication System came on and called for emergency help.
V2 was driven by a 44 year-old female in good health and wearing her prescription lenses that correct both a hyperopic (far-sighted) and myopic (condition). The driver stated that her vehicle was struck in the left back by v1 and that she began to spin counterclockwise and started to pump her brakes. The driver was able to bring V2 under control and to a stop on the left paved shoulder. The fully restrained driver denied any injuries and was able to drive her vehicle from the scene after the tow company changed her left rear tire.
