This two-vehicle night time crash occurred a few hours before mid-night during dark hours on a divided urban roadway. The road consists of four southbound lanes which are divided from northbound lanes by a concrete barrier topped by a metal rail, then by a landscaped median. Northbound lanes were not a factor in this crash. This four-lane roadway is bituminous, has no visible defects, curves to the left slightly and is not controlled by any traffic control devices. The posted speed limit is 72 kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow at the time of the crash was very light. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and there were no sight restrictions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 four-door Ford Focus driven by a 37 year-old male was southbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), an unknown vehicle, was reportedly ahead of V in lane three. As both vehicles were negotiating the curve, V1 reportedly encroached over the left lane line and struck V2 in the rear right corner. After the impact the V1 overcompensated back to the right and V1 entered a clockwise rotation, departed the road to the right, and struck a light pole aft of the B-pillar on the left side causing severe damage. V1 departed the pole in a counterclockwise rotation, traveled down a hill and came to final rest on an entrance ramp to the roadway that it had previously departed. The V1 driver was tested and found to have a 0.216 BAC level. V1 was towed due to damage. The V2 driver left the crash scene and no information regarding V2 or the driver is available. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
