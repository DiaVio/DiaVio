This crash occurred in the late evening of a weekday in the westbound lanes of a high-volume, high- speed, interchange connecting two major highways. There were 2 lanes and 2 emergency paved shoulders with a concrete barrier on both sides. The bituminous roadway featured a curve to the right and a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions as the skies were clear and the traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2005 Honda Accord, was westbound in lane two traveling approximately 161kmph (100 mph). As the vehicle began slowing down approaching the curve it began fish tailing out of control. V1 departed the roadway to the left colliding with the concrete barrier. After making impact with the left concrete barrier her vehicle bounced across the 2 lanes and slammed into the right side concrete barrier. V1 came to final rest facing north in the middle of the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 129 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 17-year-old female in good health and on her way home for the evening. The driver stated in the interview that she hit the brakes to slow the vehicle before the curve. As she hit the brakes the vehicle started to fish tail out of control and hit the barrier on the side of the road. The driver was uninjured, however V1 was towed due to damage.
