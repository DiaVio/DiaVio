Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Ford Explorer, was traveling northbound in lane one. The traffic ahead slowed, the road was wet. The driver steered to the right and braked hard at the same time. The vehicle swerved to the right as the vehicle ran off the right side of the roadway where the front bumper impacted the embankment at an angle, causing the vehicle to roll over coming to rest on its top facing southbound. Because of the ABS, the vehicle tracked as it crossed over the exit lane and paved shoulder before it entered the sod roadside. As a result of the crash, the restrained driver suffered neck pain. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
