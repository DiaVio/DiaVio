V1, a 1996 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling northbound on a four-lane dry asphalt roadway that was divided by a grass median (two lanes each direction). The roadway was curved slightly to the left and had an uphill grade of 2 percent. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred in the late morning hours.
V1 was driven by a 55-year old male who had been involved in a previous crash just minutes before at an intersection about a mile away. He did not stop for the first crash. V1 then departed the roadway on the right-hand side. V1 crossed over an adjacent street and its front contacted a stop sign and then a fire hydrant. V1 then crossed over a sidewalk and its front struck a fence. V1 crossed over another sidewalk and struck another fence. V1 reentered the roadway and then departed it on the left side. V1's right front struck a tree before coming to final rest against it. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 reported that he could not remember the crash. He had a history of sleep apnea and chronic back pain, and had taken Vicodan and Soma prior to the crash. The medications played a major role in the crash. The driver of V1 was uninjured, but was transported to a local trauma facility where his blood was drawn for a blood and alcohol test. The results of that test were not made available. Medical records and EMS records indicated that the driver of V1 could not stay awake and was shaky and unsteady on his feet.
