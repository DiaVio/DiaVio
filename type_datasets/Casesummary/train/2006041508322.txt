The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, ten-lane interstate roadway, divided by a concrete traffic barrier. There were five northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekend afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2001 Oldsmobile Alero with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane four. V1 was approaching a slower moving vehicle in the same lane. V1 changed lanes to the left (lane five) in order to pass the slower vehicle. V1 then began to change lanes to the right to get back into lane four. A phantom vehicle in lane three was simultaneously attempting to get into lane four. V1 swerved left, successfully avoiding contact with the phantom car, but losing control of the vehicle in the process. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise as it traveled across lane five toward the barrier wall. The front of V1 made contact with the concrete barrier wall. The right rear of V1 then made contact with the barrier wall as the vehicle continued to rotate. V1 came to final rest facing southbound in the inside emergency shoulder of the interstate. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
The Oldsmobile Alero was driven by a 49-year old male, who was not injured. He said he was on his way to a friend's house for a cookout. He first stated during his interview that another vehicle made contact with his right front. He later admitted that there was no contact, but that he swerved to the left to avoid the other car.
