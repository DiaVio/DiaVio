This single-vehicle crash occurred mid-after noon. The location was an on-ramp to an interstate highway. The roadway was a bituminous two-lane undivided roadway, with a curve to the left, followed by the division of the roadway into a single lane with concrete barriers on both sides. The weather was cloudy and the travel lanes were wet from heavy rain. The posted speed limit was 97 kmph (60 mph), with a recommended speed of 40 kmph (25 mph) on the curve.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Honda Accord sedan driven by a nineteen (19) year old female, was traveling northbound in lane one. As V1 was negotiating the curve to the left she lost traction, and lost control of the vehicle. The driver hit the brakes and steered to the left. The front of V1 struck the right side concrete barrier with the front left corner. V1 then rotated clockwise and backwards into the other concrete barrier on the left side of the roadway and impacted with the left rear corner. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated her vehicle had bald tires, and the brakes were bad. She also stated the roadway was very slick and oily as the was the first rain in a while. It was reasoned in assigning the critical reason that if driver was aware of these conditions caution should have been applied. The tires on V1 had sufficient inflation pressure, the rear tires had minimal tread depth. The driver stated she felt fatigued when she woke up and when she left school that day to head home. The driver takes the medication Adderall for Attention Deficit Disorder.
