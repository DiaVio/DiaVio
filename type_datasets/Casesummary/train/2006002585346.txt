This crash occurred in the late morning of a weekday on the right roadside of an undivided rural roadway. The east/west roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry and level but curved sharply to the left (as one traveled east). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2000 Buick Century, was eastbound approaching the curve. As V1 entered the curve, it failed to slow down and properly negotiate it. V1 drove off the right side of the roadway and struck a 21 cm diameter tree with its right side. V1 came to rest facing in a northeasterly direction on the roadside. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 35-year-old female who was transported, treated and hospitalized. A family member was interviewed and provided the following information. The driver of V1 suffered from bi-polar disorder, which was treated with several medications. The driver claimed that she had blacked out due to her accidentally taking too much medication and overdosing. She had no recollection of the crash events. She had been coming from a friend's house less than a mile from the crash and drove the roadway several times per month. She had an irregular sleep pattern and usually woke up feeling drowsy. She did not work.
