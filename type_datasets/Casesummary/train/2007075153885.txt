This single-vehicle crash occurred in the grass median of a four-lane divided roadway. The southbound direction of the roadway consisted of two through lanes. This roadway was curving right, level and bituminous with a posted 105 kmph (65 mph). The crash occurred during daylight hours with poor road conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee with only the driver present, was southbound in lane two. A non-contact vehicle in lane one started to enter lane two, next to V1. In an attempt to keep space between the vehicles, the driver of V1 moved a little to the left. In doing so V1 lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise. V1 continued to depart the roadway while rotating counterclockwise until contacting a delineator post with its right side and then continued on to impact a guardrail with its front end. V1 traveled along the guardrail for 15 meters (49 feet) before coming to rest on all four tires facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a fifty-eight-year-old male, was on his way from one work location to another when the crash occurred. He was rested, drives this route weekly and is very comfortable with the vehicle. The driver stated being in good health and takes no medications. He was listening to the radio and driving approximately 80 kmph (50 mph) due to the blowing snow and slick roadway conditions.
