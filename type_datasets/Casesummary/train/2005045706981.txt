The crash occurred on a four-lane, two way arterial road that was not physically divided. The road was straight and level, ran north/south, and had a posted speed limit of 72kph (45mph). The road runs through an urban business district with no access control and parking lots on both side of the road. The crash occurred on a weekday during the evening rush hour with dark, unlit, and congested conditions.
Vehicle #1 was a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero turning left out of a parking lot on the east side of the road with the intent of heading south on the arterial road. A non-contact vehicle in the right northbound lane waved her all clear to proceed with the turn. Vehicle #2, a 2004 Subaru Outback, was slowing down for traffic up ahead in the left northbound lane when it was struck on the right side by the front of Vehicle #1. Both vehicles came to rest very close to impact. Vehicle #1 was driven from the scene before the researcher's arrival. Vehicle #2 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
