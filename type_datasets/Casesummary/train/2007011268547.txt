The crash occurred at a four-legged rural intersection of two-way bituminous roads with dirt shoulders, controlled by a stop sign. Three of the legs were two lanes and the southeast leg had an additional right turn lane. Conditions at the time of the weekday afternoon crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2003 Ford Ranger pick up truck driven by an 18 year old male, was southbound on the road intending to cross through the intersection on his way home from work. The driver stated that he stopped at the stop sign for about 5 seconds, looked right, left and then pulled out into the intersection. The driver stated that he saw a truck behind v2, but did not see v2 coming from his right until just prior to impact, and that v2 was possibly blocked from his line of sight by the right B pillar of his vehicle. The right side of v1 was struck by the front of v2. The driver of v1 took no avoidance actions. V1 rotated counterclockwise after the impact and the right side of v1 struck the left side of v2. V1 continued to rotate to final rest in the northwest bound lane facing southwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver was transported to a local hospital due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1999 Ford F650 XLT cab behind engine straight truck with a GVWR of 26,000 pounds, was driven southeast bound by a 36 year-old male transporting a 2,000 pound Kubota tractor on the flat bed. The driver had just picked up the tractor and was on his way to deliver it as part of his work day. The driver stated that he noticed the pick up as he pulled out from the stop sign and steered to the right and braked to avoid v1. After the second impact V2 left the roadway on the right and continued down an embankment where v2 sideswiped small trees. V2 came to rest facing south. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver denied injuries at the scene.
