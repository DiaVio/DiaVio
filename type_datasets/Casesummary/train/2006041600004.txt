This crash occurred in the afternoon of weekday on a high volume, high occupancy, high-speed interstate highway. The highway consisted of five lanes running northbound and five lanes running southbound separated by a concrete wall. The highway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2005 Dodge Ram Truck, was northbound traveling in lane two. V1 began to change lanes in lane one which was already occupied by a non-contact vehicle. V1 was jerked back sharply to the left and it started to wobble and lose control. V1 overturned onto its roof a total of 6 quarter turns before finally coming to final rest in lane four about 50m (164ft.) from where the roll initiated. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
Shortly after coming to final rest, a 1995 Toyota Camry that was traveling in lane four could not stop in time and struck V1 as it lay on its side. The driver stated he tried to brake and avoid making contact with the truck but it was too late. He struck the undercarriage of V1 and sustained minimal damage to the left front of his vehicle. He was uninjured and was able to drive away from the scene.
V1 was driven by a 40 year-old female who was on her way home on a work related errand. She stated in the interview that she was going to be exiting the highway at the next exit and decided to change lanes into lane one, but then noticed another vehicle in lane one approaching too quickly so she jerked the wheel to the left back which caused the rollover. The driver of V1 and her passenger were transported due to injuries and the truck was towed due to damages.
