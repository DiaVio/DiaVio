This one-vehicle crash occurred on a weekday during daylight hours on a two-lane east/west roadway. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight and level, and was not physically divided. There were no traffic control devices associated with this particular stretch of roadway. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan, was heading east on the roadway intending to continue straight. The vehicle drifted off the right side of the road and struck a couch that was positioned off the right side of the roadway. The vehicle then continued traveling off the road and contacted a signpost, and finally a utility pole. After contacting the utility pole, the vehicle rotated counter clockwise approximately 45 degrees before coming to final rest facing northeast off the right side of the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 71 year-old female, suffered from chest contusions and was transported to the hospital for treatment. There was one other occupant located in the right front passenger seat that was also taken to the hospital for unknown injuries. A complete interview was conducted with the aid of the driver's daughter who acted as a go-between because the driver was still a little upset about the situation. It was relayed that the driver had noticed the couch and was trying to make a conscious effort to avoid it. She still headed toward the couch and struck it. She was in good health and the only medication she was on was daily vitamins. No other health or fatigue related factors contributed to this crash. The driver was comfortable with her surroundings and her vehicle was in proper working condition.
