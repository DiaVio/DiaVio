V1, a 1998 Honda Accord two-door coupe with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V2, a 1992 Ford Ranger pickup truck with three occupants, was stopped in lane one ahead of V1. V3, a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder four-door utility vehicle with two occupants, was stopped in lane one ahead of V2. As V1 approached V2, its driver braked and steered right in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid impact. The front left of V1 struck the back right of V2 (Event 1), causing it to rotate slightly in a counterclockwise direction as it was pushed forward about 2m to where the front of V2 struck the back of V3 (Event 2). This impact pushed V3 forward about 2m as it rotated slightly in a clockwise direction. V1 came to rest within 2m of impact facing northwest straddling lane one and the right shoulder. V2 came to rest within 2m of the first impact facing southwest in lane one. V3 came to rest within 2m of impact facing northwest straddling lane one and the right shoulder.
