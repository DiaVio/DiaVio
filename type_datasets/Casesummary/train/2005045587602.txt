The crash occurred on a two-lane east/west urban roadway. The road is normally a four-lane road but utility construction had it narrowed to two lanes. Barrels and a painted line were on the south side of the road separating the area undergoing construction. The section of road where the crash occurred is straight, but there is a sharp 30-degree curve 103m east of impact. Precrash road grades are -3.6% westbound and +3% eastbound. The speed limit was 48 kmph (30 mph) due to construction; curve advisory signs are also in place. Conditions at the time of the crash were dry on a weekend morning just after dawn with light traffic.
