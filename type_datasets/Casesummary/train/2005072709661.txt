A five-vehicle crash occurred in the morning daylight hours on an eastbound three-lane urban expressway. The expressway consists of three eastbound lanes that go into a slight right curve. Shoulders border the roadway, and to the north is a concrete median that separates these lanes from the westbound lanes of the expressway. The speed limit on the expressway was 89 kmph (55 mph). There was traffic congestion due to morning rush hour, and the weather conditions were clear.
Vehicle one (V1), a 5-axle configuration of a 2005 International 9900 model tractor & 1998 Manac semi-trailer with one passenger, was traveling in lane one (the far right lane).
