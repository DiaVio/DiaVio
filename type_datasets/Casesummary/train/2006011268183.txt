The crash occurred at an urban intersection of two straight, bituminous roads. V1 was traveling on a two-way, two-lane, level road with an un-posted residential speed limit of 40 kmh (25 mph), controlled by a stop sign. V2 was traveling on a one-way, two lane, plus a parking lane, road with an uphill slope >2% and a posted speed limit of 48 kmh (30 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekend afternoon crash were daylight, cloudy and dry.
V1, a 2007 Ford Escape 4 door utility vehicle, driven by a 19 year-old female on her way to work, was traveling south and stopped for about 3 seconds at the stop sign at the intersection. The driver was late to work, and taking an unfamiliar route, in a new vehicle that she was driving for the third time. The driver stated that she looked to the left but did not see V2. A witness driving behind v2 stated that v1 did not even slow for the stop sign, and then V1 proceeded into the intersection. The front of v1 struck the right side of v2. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest along the curb east of the intersection, facing east. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage, and the fully restrained driver denied injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1998 Toyota Corolla 4 door sedan, driven by a 22 year-old male on his way from church to lunch, was traveling east on the one-way road approaching the intersection in lane one, when the driver observed v1 pulling out from the stop sign. The driver of v2 steered into the left lane and accelerated in an attempt to avoid v1. V2 was struck in the right side by v1. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest past v1 along the curb facing east. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver denied injuries. The fully restrained front right adult female passenger was transported to a local trauma center.
