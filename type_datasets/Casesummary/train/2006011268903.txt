The crash occurred in the late evening of a weekday on the roadside of an interchange ramp from a westbound fully controlled highway to a northbound fully controlled highway. The ramp curved right and joined a collector lane on the left to form one wide straight, bituminous lane with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). Traffic flow was normal but the roadways were wet at the time of the crash from a rain that had fallen previously.
V1, a 1997 GEO Prizm LSi, was westbound negotiating the right hand curved highway ramp. The driver of v1 braked and steered right losing control on the wet pavement. As V1 attempted to merge into the collector it was traveling faster than the vehicles already in the lane and had to steer right. V1 left the roadway on the right, crossed the paved shoulder and went down an embankment rolling right 2 quarter turns, before coming to final rest on its roof facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 46 year-old male on his commute to work. The driver of V1 stated that there were vehicles in front and next to him as the ramp joined the collector lane and he was not able to successfully merge and had to brake and steer right to avoid hitting the other vehicles. The driver of V1 was not injured but V2 was towed from the scene due to damage.
