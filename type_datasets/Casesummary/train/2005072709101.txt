This one vehicle crash occurred early evening on a two-way road during clear nighttime conditions. The road is undivided and runs north and south with no control devices. There is a road that runs east from the two-way road, and a series of drive ways that go into a factory on the west side of the road, but neither of these played a role in the crash. The speed limit of the north/south road is 50 kmph (30 mph). Parallel parking is allowed on both sides of the street.
Vehicle one, a 1996 Mazda Millenia, with one occupant, was traveling southbound. The driver allowed the vehicle to wander to the right and the front of the vehicle struck the left side of vehicle two, which was parked. The Mazda then rolled over in a counter-clockwise rotation along its longitudinal axis and came to final rest on its top. Vehicle two, a 1999 Ford F-150, was parked at an unknown location on the west side of the street. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
