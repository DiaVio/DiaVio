This two-vehicle collision occurred during evening hours on a weekend; it was dark at the time. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a five-lane, two-way, dry, bituminous roadway with a two-way left turn lane. The roadway is designated a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone. Private business driveways intersect the west road edge. The east road edge runs parallel to train tracks; a chain-link fence separates the tracks and the road. On the east roadside, bicycle lanes are separated from other traffic by a raised median. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions and the road was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Mazda Millenia 4-door sedan, was eastbound exiting a business drive, intending to turn left into northbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 GMC C-1500 extended cab pickup, was traveling southbound in the second lane, approaching the private drive on its right with the intention of continuing straight. As V1 executed the turn, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V2 came to rest in the roadway near impact. V1 accelerated from impact and continued eastbound, crossing all traffic lanes and departing the road over the east curb, causing damage to the front plane. V1 traversed the bike lanes and impacted the chain-link fence with its front plane; the fence gave way and V1 went under it. V1 continued eastbound off the road and drove over the railroad tracks. V1 then impacted a cinder-block wall with its front, bringing V1 to rest. Cinder blocks fell from the wall and damaged the hood, roof, and windshield of V1. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
