Case 128
This single-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on a 2-lane undivided rural roadway. The north/south roadway has a posted speed limit of 69 kmph (45 mph), is flat and is curved to the left near the location of this crash. The bituminous roadway was wet from a rainstorm and it was cloudy and daylight. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
V1, a 1997 Suzuki Sidekick with two occupants, was northbound negotiating the curve when it began to hydroplane and departed the left of the road. V1 spun clockwise into a tree with its left side (event #1) and into another tree (event #2) with its left side again. V1 came to rest on the left of the roadway, facing northwest. Both of the occupants fled the scene and the vehicle was towed from the scene.
The driver of V1 is a 24-year-old male that works as a painter and was driving home because the rainstorm cancelled their work for the day. As he rounded this curve, the vehicle began to "fishtail" and he lost control of it. He reportedly braked but could not re-gain control of the vehicle as it crashed into the trees. A co-worker that was following them stopped at that crash site and drove him home.
