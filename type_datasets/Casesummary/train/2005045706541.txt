The crash occurred on a north/south urban US Highway at an intersection with a crossing street from a shopping center that ran east/west. The northbound travel lanes for the highway were separated from the southbound lanes by a grassy median that was no less than 30 meters wide. There were four northbound travel lanes with lane one being a right turn-only lane and lane four a left turn-only lane. The crossing street had three lanes on the east side of the intersection with two lanes westbound and one lane eastbound. The two directions of travel were divided by a raised concrete island. Both roadways were straight and level and the intersection was controlled on all sides by traffic lights. The posted speed limit for the north/south highway was 72KPH/45MPH and the posted speed limit for the east/west roadway was 48KPH/30MPH. The crash occurred on a weekday in the mid-morning hours. The conditions were daylight and dry.
Vehicle 2, a 2001 Mack concrete mixer truck, was northbound in lane #2 (the right through lane), passing through the intersection on solid green when Vehicle 1, a 2001 Mazda Tribute, entered the intersection from the east (right) and collided with the right side of Vehicle 2. This caused V1 to be dragged about twenty meters north and left facing northwest in the right northbound lane. Vehicle 2 pulled forward onto the shoulder to get out of the way of traffic. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage, and V2 was repaired on the side of the road by a company service truck, then driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
