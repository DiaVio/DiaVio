This two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of a seven-lane, north/south roadway and a two-lane, east/west roadway during afternoon daytime hours on a weekday. The intersection was controlled by a tri-light traffic signal. The speed limit for northbound traffic was 40 kmph (25 mph), 56 kmph (35 mph) for southbound. At the time of the crash there were no adverse weather conditions. The roadway in the area of the crash was in poor condition; the travel lanes in both directions had undergone resurfacing preparation by a riding grinder, removing lane lines and leaving the road surface very rough.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Ford Escort station wagon, was traveling northbound in the fourth lane and approaching the intersection with the intention of turning left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1985 Toyota Celica, was traveling southbound in the third lane of opposing traffic and approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V1 executed the turn, the front of V1 impacted the front of V2. Both vehicles deflected southwest and cam to rest in the southbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
