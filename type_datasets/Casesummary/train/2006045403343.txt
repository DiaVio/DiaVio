The roadway was asphalt with a posted speed limit of 113 kph (70 mph). The roadway was dry and slightly curved to the right (radius of curvature of 882 meters) and with an 8% super-elevation. The crash occurred about mid-morning on a dry clear weekend day. Traffic was light.
V1, a 1997 Toyota Corolla, 4-door with 4 occupants, was traveling eastbound on lane two. V1 was negotiating the slightly right curved road when it drove off the left edge of the roadway onto the rumble strip and then the grass median. The noise startled the driver who began to steer right while braking. The driver overcompensated causing the car to spin around clockwise. It re-entered the roadway and traveled across the two eastbound lanes. V1 went off the right side of the roadway across the shoulder onto a soft stretch of roadside. V1 flipped over onto its right side and then 3 more quarter turns before it struck an embankment, landing upright, headed north with the rear end resting on the embankment which had a slope of about 16%. The distance traveled by V1 during rollover was approximately 14 meters. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
