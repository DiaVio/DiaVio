This single-vehicle crash occurred on the north side of an east/west roadway, approximately 30 meters before an overpass. This roadway is divided by a grassy median as well as jersey barriers and has two through lanes in each direction. This roadway is straight and level, with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours; there were no adverse atmospheric conditions and traffic flow was moderate.
Vehicle one, a 1992 Isuzu Rodeo, was westbound in lane one. Vehicle one departed the roadway on the right and the front struck a guardrail. The vehicle continued westbound, rotating counterclockwise. Vehicle one then rolled over to the right five quarter-turns, across a ditch, up a grassy embankment and down the concrete embankment under the overpass. The top of the vehicle struck the bridge support. Vehicle one came to rest on its right side, facing northeast. Vehicle one was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver of vehicle one, a forty-three-year-old female, was traveling with her boyfriend and her three-year-old son, from her home, on their way to deliver some gifts. This driver was seriously injured when she was ejected during this crash and could not remember anything about the crash or any events just prior to the crash. The right front passenger, the driver's thirty-eight-year-old boyfriend, was interviewed as well as two witnesses. This driver was reportedly well rested and in good health at the time of the crash. She had purchased the vehicle the day before and was using the cruise control that she was not familiar with while driving at highway speed. Both witnesses indicated that vehicle one traveled off the side of the road for no apparent reason and made no apparent attempts to avoid the crash.
