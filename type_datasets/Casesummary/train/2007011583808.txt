The single vehicle, weekend evening crash occurred in lane one of a two-lane interstate roadway that is level, with a curve left in the eastbound direction with no positive barrier in the grassy median. At the time of the crash it was dark-unlighted, clear and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit was 113kmph (70mph).
V1, a 2006 Mercury Milan occupied by a 66 year-old male driver and a 64 year-old female passenger, was eastbound in lane one of the roadway described above. A full-grown deer ran from the driver's left into lane one where V1 struck it with its front. The deer was killed and the carcass came to rest on the inside shoulder of the eastbound lanes. Both front airbags deployed in vehicle 1 and the driver was able to bring V1 to a controlled stop on the right shoulder facing east. Neither occupant of V1 was injured but V1 had to be towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that he was on his way home and had been driving for almost 2 hours. He said he was going about 108 kmph (67 mph) in the right lane with his cruise control on when the deer ran in front of his car from his left and he was unable to avoid hitting it. He said he never saw the deer until he had already hit it.
