Vehicle #1 was a 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII northbound on the two lane road. Vehicle #2, a Dodge 1500 Series Ram pickup, was eastbound on the intersecting road. Vehicle #1 stopped at the stop sign then attempted to cross the intersection and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle #2. After impact the Lincoln (V1) went into a lawn off the northeast corner of the intersection and struck a fence with its front where it came to rest facing north. The Dodge pickup (V2) came to rest facing northeast in the northeast corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage but there were no injuries to the drivers.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 50-year old belted female with no deployed airbags that was familiar with the area. She stated that she stopped at the stop sign, thought it was clear and proceeded into the intersection. The driver said she saw Vehicle #2 when she was about half way across the intersection and braked and steered right. She believes she looked left then right before starting across the intersection. Police charged the driver with failure to yield.
