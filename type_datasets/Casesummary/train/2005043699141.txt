The crash occurred at a four-way intersection of two rural roadways. Each roadway was a two-way, two-lane, undivided roadway leading to a traffic signal controlled intersection. The roadway had a posted speed of 45 MPH. The southbound lanes had an uphill grade of 1%. The other lanes were level. Conditions were daylight with rain. The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday.
Vehicle #1 was a 2002 Ford Explorer traveling south approaching the intersection. Vehicle #2 was a 2001 Dodge 3500 Dually pickup traveling west approaching the same intersection. V2 came to a stop at the intersection for a red signal light. V1 proceeded towards the intersection as a tractor-trailer was passing through the intersection from the opposite direction. The tractor-trailer temporarily obscured V1 and V2's view of each other, as well as V2's view of the traffic signal. After the tractor-trailer had cleared the intersection, V2 proceeded into the intersection. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2. Both vehicles came to rest on the southwest roadside. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 48-year old male who was transported to a local hospital with possible injuries. He stated that he thought the tractor-trailer distracted the other driver into forgetting about the traffic light. He estimated his travel speed to be 40 MPH due to a recent fear of intersections and deer. He stated that he braked and steered right when he saw the other vehicle enter the intersection. His sport utility vehicle was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a 56-year old female who was uninjured. She stated that she stopped at the intersection for approximately 30 seconds and then proceeded through with a green light. Her vehicle was towed due to damage.
