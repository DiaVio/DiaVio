The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west four-lane undivided urban highway and a two-lane residential side street. The highway was straight and level for approximately two hundred meters on either side of the crash location. The side street intersected on the north side of the highway. Conditions were dark and dry on a weekday evening with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph).
V1, a 1988 Chevrolet 1500 series pickup, was eastbound on the highway traveling in the left (2nd) lane. Ahead V2, a 1993 GMC 2500 series pickup, was stopped eastbound in the left lane waiting for traffic to clear so it could turn left to the intersecting side street. V1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended V2. Both vehicles came to rest just east of impact. V1 was towed due to damage; V2 was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a belted 39 year-old male who was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries. Based on his interview he apparently saw the other pickup stopped ahead and intended to change lanes to the right to avoid slowing down. When he checked the right lane over his shoulder other vehicles were present so he was forced to remain in the left lane. The driver applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. Police charged him with DUI, failure to maintain control, and driving on a revoked license.
V2 was operated by a belted 30-year old male who was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries. The driver was wearing glasses to correct a nearsighted condition. He indicated he'd been stopped waiting to turn left for 15-20 seconds prior to impact and never saw the other pickup approaching from behind.
