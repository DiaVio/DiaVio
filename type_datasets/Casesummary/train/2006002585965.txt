The crash occurred on a level three lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 20 MPH (32 KPH). The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekday afternoon crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
Vehicle 1, a 1989 Oldsmobile 98, was traveling west on a two lane undivided roadway controlled by a stop sign approaching the main “ring road”. Vehicle 1 entered the main roadway to turn left, went across all three lanes and off the west side of the roadway. Vehicle 1 continued and struck a 30 cm diameter concrete based sign post with its front. Vehicle 1 drove over the signpost, continued through the grass median and came back on the roadway in the right lane. Vehicle 1 then continued in the right turn only lane, passed through the intersection approximately 100 meters, went off the right side of the roadway and struck a 60 cm diameter cement based light pole with its front. Vehicle 1 came to rest facing in a northeasterly direction. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.
The Oldsmobile 98 was driven by a belted 79-year-old female who was transported, treated and released at a local hospital for a minor laceration to her nose. She stated that she had been at the mall shopping and was on her way home to let her dog out. She also stated that she had a taco to eat during the afternoon. She advised that she left the mall, was not feeling well and should have sat in her car until she felt better. She got in her car and remembered nothing thereafter until EMS personnel were helping her after hitting the light pole. She considers herself in good health, wears corrective lenses for hyperopic (far-sighted) and myopic (near-sighted) and takes medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol.
