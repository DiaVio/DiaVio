This crash occurred in the raised median of an urban roadway that runs between three northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. The crash occurred on a weekend night that featured clear skies and no adverse conditions. The dry, level, and straight roadway had a posted speed of 56kmph (35 mph).
V1 a 2006 Dodge Ram truck was northbound in lane two traveling approximately 80 kmph (50 mph) when the driver lost control of his vehicle and began rotating counter-clockwise. The right rear tire of V1 struck the curb of the median causing it to separate from the rest of the vehicle. V1 came to final rest in the median. This call originally came into the police dispatch as two vehicles drag racing but, the driver of V1 never made mention of another vehicle during the interview. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a seventeen year-old male in good health on his way home. He claimed that he hit some standing water in the roadway from sprinklers that caused him to lose control of the truck and rotate into the grass. He made no mention of racing or of another vehicle during the interview. The water that he claimed to have caused him to lose control was more than 50 meters back, making his story unlikely. He was not injured but since the right wheel came off the truck it was towed due to damage.
