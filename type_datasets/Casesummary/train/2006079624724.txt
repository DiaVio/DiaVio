This two-vehicle collision occurred during morning daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred on a straight stretch of a five-lane, positively divided, dry, level, concrete expressway in stop-and-go traffic. The fifth lane is designated for high occupancy vehicles. In the area of the crash, a freeway entrance ramp was just ahead of the crash area, and another was just behind, which contributed to the congestion. The speed limit in that area was 105 kmph (65 mph). At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Nissan Altima four-door sedan, was traveling southbound in the first lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Toyota Sequoia four-door SUV, was ahead of V1 in the same lane. V2 decelerated for slower traffic ahead, and the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in their original lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
