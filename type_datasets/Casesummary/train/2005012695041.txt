V1, a 2003 Pontiac Vibe, was traveling westbound on a dry 5-lane undivided (3 lanes westbound, 2 lanes eastbound) asphalt roadway in dark conditions. V2, a 1997 Oldsmobile Silhouette, was also traveling westbound on the same roadway. The roadway was dry, straight, and level, with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). Both vehicles were traveling in the first lane, with V1 following V2. V2 stopped for a red light at a 4-way signalized intersection. The front of V1 contacted the back of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway. Both drivers and the one passenger in V2 were transported to a local trauma center and treated for moderate injuries.
The driver of V1, a 53-year old female, reported that she was traveling between 31-40 mph. She was unaware of how the crash had happened. The police and ambulance reported that the driver might have had a seizure, which may have been the cause of the accident. There was no evidence of any braking on the part of V1. The driver of the V1 had been traveling to stay with family for a few days. She had traveled for five miles before the crash occurred. She had a history of cancer and high blood pressure, neither of which seemed to have a factor in the crash. The driver reported that she felt rested and had no emotional contributors. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
