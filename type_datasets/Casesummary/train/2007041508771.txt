The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a two-way, seven-lane roadway, which was divided by a curbed median. There were four westbound lanes, with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday evening with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2000 Plymouth Neon with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V2, a 1997 Ford F-150 with one occupant, was also traveling in lane one, ahead of V1. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
The Plymouth Neon was driven by a 27-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from work. The driver indicated that he briefly took his eyes off the road to glance at something, although he could not recall what he was looking at. When the driver focused his attention to his front, he discovered that he was overtaking the vehicle in front of him. The driver locked his brakes, but could not stop in time.
The Ford F-150 was driven by a 43-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was stopping to pick something up at Walgreen's on his way home from work. The driver was initially going to stop at the bank first, but decided not to. He indicated that he, along with the rest of traffic, was traveling around 48 kmph (30 mph). The motorist estimated that the driver of V2 was traveling at nearly twice the velocity of surrounding traffic, although he admitted that he didn't actually see the other driver approaching.
