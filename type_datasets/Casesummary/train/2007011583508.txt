The single vehicle, weekday, early morning crash occurred in the median off the left side of the 2, straight, level, bituminous, northbound lanes of a 4-lane, interstate roadway. The southbound lanes were separated from the northbound lanes by a grassy median and a metal guardrail. At the time of the crash the roadway was dry, it was dark and traffic was moderate. The posted speed limit was 113 kmh (70mph).
V1, a 2001 Honda Civic solely occupied by a 37 year-old female driver, was northbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above. V1 drifted to the right toward, and began to enter, lane 1. V1 then veered to the left across lane 2 exiting the roadway where it went into a clockwise yaw just as it entered the median. V1 rolled to the left 9/4 turns and came to rest in the grassy median lying on its left side facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that she was on her way to work, northbound in lane 2 going about 65-70mph. She was on time and driving a route that she used daily. She was giving a presentation that day and had bags of paper handouts for her audience. One of the bags was on the front passenger seat. It began to fall over so she reached to catch it, looked up and saw that she was drifting to the right towards a semi truck in lane 1. She jerked the wheel to the left and went into the median where she steered to the right. She said the car rolled over to the left and she just "held on" until the car came to a stop on its left side.
A witness interviewed at the scene, which was following v1 in lane 2, confirmed/supported the driver's description of the crash events as stated above.
