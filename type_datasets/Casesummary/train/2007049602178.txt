This single-vehicle crash occurred on a weekday during late evening hours. The location was an entrance ramp of a major highway. The ramp extends from underneath the thru traffic lanes, is uphill and curves left before a slight right curve as it merges with the through lanes. The weather was clear and the roads dry. The posted speed limit for the highway was 97 kmph (60 mph). A W-beam guardrail protects the outside of the curve. Mounted on poles behind the guardrail are chevron alignment signs signifying the change in horizontal alignment.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Ford Ranger pick up with one occupant, was traveling south on the entrance ramp with the intention to merge and enter the through traffic lanes. V1 drove off to the road to the left, then re-entered the roadway and departed the right side of the ramp while in a clockwise rotation. The front of V1 impacted the guardrail located west of the southbound lanes. V1 rolled over to the left three quarter-turns. The vehicle came to rest on its right side adjacent to the guardrail. Motorists stopped and up righted the vehicle, the left rear corner of the vehicle coming to rest on the guardrail. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
