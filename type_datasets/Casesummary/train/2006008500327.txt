This crash occurred in the southbound lane of a north/south undivided two-lane roadway. There was one northbound lane and one southbound lane. This was a straight, bituminous roadway, with a slight downhill grade in the southbound direction (3 percent) and a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). It was late afternoon on a weekday, it had recently stopped raining and the roadway was still wet.
V1 was a 1992 Toyota 4-Runner sport utility vehicle driven by a 16-year-old male. The vehicle had 3 passengers. V2 was a 2005 Chevrolet Colorado pickup driven by a 71-year-old male. V2 was stopped in the southbound lane of the roadway waiting to turn left onto an intersecting roadway. V1 was traveling in the same lane when it collided into the back of V1. V1 went off of the roadway to the right after the collision and V2 was pushed forward and to the right, remaining on the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 was traveling to a friend's house. He and the other passengers were returning from the funeral of one of their friends. The driver advised that he was emotionally upset and distracted. Immediately prior to the crash he had been looking to the left at a field. One of the passengers warned of the stopped vehicle in the lane and he hit the brakes and steered to the right. The car skidded on the wet road and hit the back of V2. It is likely that V1 would still have contacted V2 even if the roadway had been dry.
