Vehicle one (V1) was a 1993 Dodge pickup driven by a fifty two year old male with one passenger. V1 was eastbound and had just left the intersection when it steered left across the centerline and exited the left road edge. Once off the roadway it sideswiped two upright posts then continued west and vaulted over the irrigation canal. Once over this canal it impacted the canal embankment with its front bumper and suspension and flew upwards flipping end-over-end coming to rest on top of some desert type trees. V1 was disabled and towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that he could not remember anything prior to this crash. He stated that he had not been able to sleep for 3 days prior and thought that he may have had a seizure. He was transported to a local hospital and was hospitalized for a broken leg. The passenger stated that right as they had left the intersection she noticed that the vehicle began to speed up very fast, and when she looked at the driver to tell him to slow down, he was stretched straight out with the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor. She reached over and tried to pull his foot from the pedal but about that time they sideswiped the pipe then vaulted the canal. After the impact with the embankment, she could not remember much, only being pulled from the truck by EMS.
