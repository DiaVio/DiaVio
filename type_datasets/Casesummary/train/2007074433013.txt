This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon in the four eastbound travel lanes of a divided interstate. The roadway surface was concrete, straight, level, and covered with snow. Active heavy snowfall had occurred prior to the time of collision and the travel lanes were slick. The posted speed limit is 97 kmph (60 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu sedan driven by a thirty (30) year-old male , was traveling east in lane three with the intention of going straight. Vehicle two (V2) was a 2001 Freightliner tractor pulling one semi-trailer driven by a twenty nine (29) year-old male. V2 was traveling in lane four with the intention of going straight. V1 started to fishtail on the snow, which caused the driver to lose control and rotate counterclockwise with the front going under the right side of V2's trailer. After impact with the trailer's right side tires, V1 spun clockwise and came to final rest diagonally across lane three facing northwest. V2 came to a controlled stop facing east on the left shoulder. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
