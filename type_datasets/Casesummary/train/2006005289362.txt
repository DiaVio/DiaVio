This crash occurred on a weekday evening on the right roadside of an undivided rural roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level, but there were no streetlights to illuminate this particular stretch of roadway. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse, was southbound in lane one when ahead and to the left, a deer had entered the roadway. The driver of V1 steered right to avoid the deer, but over-steered and V1 departed the roadway to the right.

The vehicle had to be removed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 17 year-old male, suffered unknown injuries and was taken to the hospital for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred.

A deer had entered the roadway from his left side, and the driver took evasive actions to avoid the animal. He veered off the roadway to the right side and struck a tree. Based on the interview, no fatigue or health related factors were coded for this driver. The driver did state that he receives approximately four hours of sleep a night, but felt rested when the trip began. He also mentioned that he was currently on medication to treat ADHD.
