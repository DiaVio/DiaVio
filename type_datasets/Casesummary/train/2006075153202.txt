The rear-end collision involving four vehicles occurred during daylight hours in mid-afternoon on a Thursday. The crash occurred on an eight lane undivided, two-way urban roadway in the third lane going southbound. There were three lanes going southbound and five lanes going northbound. This was a straight, slightly down hill, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). It was mid-afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. The traffic volume was heavy and traffic forward of the involved vehicles had stopped for a non-contact vehicle attempting to make a left turn.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee four door sport utility vehicle with three occupants was traveling southbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Chrysler Concorde four door with one occupant was traveling southbound in front of vehicle one in the same lane. Vehicle three (V3), a 1996 Ford Windstar three door mini-van with a driver and three other occupants was also traveling southbound in front of vehicle two in the same lane. Traffic began to slow to a stop because of a non-contact vehicle that was stopped waiting to make a left turn. The front of vehicle one contacted the back of vehicle two pushing vehicle two forward. In an attempt to avoid hitting the back of Vehicle three, driver two steered to the left to avoid contact with vehicle three, but was unsuccessful. The front right side of vehicle two contacted the back left side of vehicle three. Vehicle two continued to move forward and contact vehicle four (V4), a 2002 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan, which had moved to the inside left turn lane for northbound traffic. V2 contacted V4 with its right front side to V4's left side. V2 and V4 came to rest in the far left turn lane of northbound traffic. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
