This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon during daylight hours in the middle of a four-way intersection. The east/west roadway is comprised of two through lanes and a left-turn lane in each direction. Two narrow lanes, marked for bicycles and also utilized by busses, border these travel lanes and as they approach the intersection are available as an additional through for making right turns at the intersection. The north/south section is comprised of two through lanes and a left-turn lane in each direction. The intersection is controlled by stoplights at all four legs. The speed limit on the expressway was 48 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Buick Century carrying one occupant, was traveling eastbound in the fourth (left-turn) lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 GMC Yukon Denali carrying one occupant, was traveling westbound in the number two lane. The driver of V1 was initially traveling in the third lane and changed lanes to the left to enter the left-turn lane. The traffic signal was green for both vehicles, and V2 had the right-of-way. The driver of V1 never saw V2 so he made the left turn. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 180 degrees. V1 came to rest facing southbound in the first lane of the southbound road, just north of the intersection. V2 came to rest on the northeast corner facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage and neither driver was injured or transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
