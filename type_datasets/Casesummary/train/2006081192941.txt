This single vehicle crash occurred during the mid-afternoon commute. The location was an urban arterial with curbs and sidewalks on both sides and treed embankments on both roadsides. The roadway was a bituminous four lane, two way, undivided road. There was a right lane closure ahead for southbound traffic due to road construction. The road curved to the left and was a slight negative grade. Traffic was congested, slowing and changing lanes as it approached the lane closure. Temporary traffic control zone signs (black letters on red-orange background) warning of construction zone was posted in the precrash travel direction. The weather was clear and dry and there were no visibility problems. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1972 Ford 4x2 F250 regular cab pickup, was traveling southbound in the outside curb lane negotiating the curve. The driver stated he was traveling at approximately 48 kmph (30 mph). The driver stated an unknown vehicle cut in front of him and applied the brakes. The driver stated he swerved to his right and jumped the curb to avoid hitting the vehicle in front of him. He overcompensated and the vehicle went into a clockwise yaw. V1 crossed the sidewalk and then its front struck the embankment and then flipped onto its left side. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 22 year-old male, was wearing a lap belt and was not injured. He was in good health, well rested and had no health problems. He had left work approximately 20 minutes prior to the crash and travels this route daily to his residence. Even though he attended driver training at 19 years old he did not obtain a license until he was 21 years old.
