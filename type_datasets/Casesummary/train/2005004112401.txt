The crash occurred off the right side of a two-lane roadway at a T-intersection. Conditions were dry with daylight in the afternoon on a weekday. The posted speed limit on the initial roadway of travel was 80 kmph (50 MPH) and 32 kmph (20 MPH) on the intersecting roadway.
V1 was 1988 Plymouth Reliant sedan traveling eastbound. V1 was driven by a 94-year old female who was traveling approximately 20 MPH on the 50 MPH roadway. Consequently, vehicles behind her were honking their horns in an attempt to make her speed up or get out of the way. The driver of V1 tried to accelerate but did not feel her vehicle respond. She decided to turn left at a T-intersection to let the other vehicles pass her. While making the left turn, the vehicle suddenly accelerated and the driver took the turn at too wide of an angle. It departed the right side of the roadway and struck a curb, a sign, and then a tree. V1 came to final rest on the roadway facing northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
