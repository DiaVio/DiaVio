This single-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a four-lane asphalt roadway with varying curves and elevations. The north and southbound lanes are physically divided by a concrete barrier wall and guard rails border the right sides of the travel lanes. In the area of the crash, the northbound lanes curve left and are downhill. The speed limit is 104 kmph (65 mph). The crash occurred during late afternoon. The weather had turned from rain to sleet several kilometers/miles prior to the crash site and the road was icy.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was northbound in the number 2 lane negotiating a long sweeping curve when it slid off the icy roadway to the left and with it's left plane, which contacted the concrete wall. V1 bounced off the wall and crossed both northbound lanes to the right where it impacted the metal guardrail with its front end. V1 then rotated clockwise and contacted the guardrail again with its left side plane and came to rest against the guardrail facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a forty nine (49) year-old female, was unable to be contacted. She was transported due to injury. Her 3 passengers were not injured. The tires on V1 were properly inflated and had good tread depth.
