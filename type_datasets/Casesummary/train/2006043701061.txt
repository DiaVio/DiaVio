This crash occurred on a weekday morning off the left shoulder of a westbound, four-lane, interstate roadway. All four westbound lanes were featured an 8% downhill grade. The posted speed limit was 96kmph (60 mph). Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies.
V1, a 1997 Toyota 4-Runner sport utility, was westbound in lane three when a non-contact vehicle in lane two began merging into lane three. The driver of V1 steered left in avoidance, then realized a second non-contact vehicle was positioned in lane four. The driver of V1 steered right in reaction, and subsequently lost control of the vehicle. A third steering movement in the left direction caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise 80 degrees and travel over the left shoulder into the median wall. After impacting the wall with its front plane, V1 rotated counterclockwise further 180 degrees before rolling left one-quarter turn. V1 came to rest on its left plane in lane four facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 48 year-old female who was treated on scene for non-incapacitating injuries. She was wearing her prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (near-sighted) condition. She stated that she was heading to work from home on a typical workday, and was actually running a bit ahead of schedule this morning. She described a van from her right merging into her lane and her subsequent reactions resulting in overcompensation. She estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 96kmph. Her vehicle was towed due to damage.
