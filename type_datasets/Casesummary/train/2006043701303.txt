The crash occurred at an interchange intersection in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane, suburban roadway with a curbed grass median. The intersection included a southbound exit ramp, an east/west roadway, and a southbound on-ramp. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and a level grade in all directions. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was late morning hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 1999 Chevrolet 1500 van stopped facing south at the intersection. Vehicle two was a 1993 Toyota Camry sedan traveling eastbound in lane two. V1 and V2 both proceeded through the intersection. The front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2 continued off the southeast corner of the intersection, colliding into a medium-sized tree with its right side. V1 came to final rest partially off the roadway in the southeast corner. V2 came to rest against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 39-year old male who was uninjured. He stated that he was getting near his jobsite after a 4-hour commute and preparing to cross the intersection. He claims that there was sun glare in the direction of V2. He estimated that he was stopped for a second or two before proceeding, and that his speed was approximately 16 kmph (10 mph) at impact. The van continued in service after the crash.
V2 was driven by a 30-year old male who was transported to a local hospital with non-incapacitating injuries. He stated that he was heading to work when the other driver crossed the road in front of him. He braked with lockup and steered right but did not have enough time to avoid the crash. He estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 80 and 64 kmph (50 and 40 mph), respectively. The sedan was towed due to damage.
