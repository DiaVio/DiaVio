This two-vehicle crash occurred on a jersey barrier-divided, straight, level trafficway. The westbound lanes consist of four through lanes with paved shoulders on both sides. The speed limit on this roadway is 105 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred at dawn with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Honda Civic, was westbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Pontiac Grand Am, was parked (unoccupied) on the right shoulder. A non-contact vehicle in lane two began to change lanes to the right. The driver of V1 applied the brakes and steered to the right. V1 traveled onto the shoulder, skidding longitudinally, and the front struck the back of V2. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a forty-five-year-old female, was on her way to work from her home. She was healthy, well rested and familiar with her vehicle. She rarely travels this route; this is not her normal route to work. This driver takes high blood pressure medication.
