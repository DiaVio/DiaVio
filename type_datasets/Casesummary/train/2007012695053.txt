The crash occurred in southbound lanes of a six-lane two-way highway divided by a positive barrier. It had three northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. This was a straight, bituminous roadway with a downhill grade and a posted speed of 112 kmph (70 mph). It was late morning on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was congested due to construction.
V1, a 2007 Peterbilt garbage truck with two occupants was traveling southbound in lane two. V2, a 2001 Oldsmobile Alero two-door with one occupant was traveling southbound in lane three. Lane one was closed off with barrels. The driver of V1 stated that there was a vehicle in front of him that was getting off the highway onto an exit ramp. He stated that the vehicle then made a sudden lane change back onto the highway and slowed down in front of them. The driver of V1 then attempted to make a lane change to the left to avoid contacting that vehicle. He looked to the rear in his mirrors and did not see V2. He proceeded to change lanes. The left of V1 contacted the right of V2. This sent the left of V2 into the barrier wall before they both came to final rest in lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
