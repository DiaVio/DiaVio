This single-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, two-way, not physically divided roadway during daylight hours. The bituminous road was straight and level where the crash occurred. There were no traffic control devices associated with this stretch of roadway. The roadway was dry and had a posted speed limit of 64kmph (40mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Buick LeSabre, was northbound on the roadway in lane one. The vehicle's right front wheel briefly left the roadway. The driver then attempted to correct this by steering the vehicle to the left. In doing so, the vehicle traveled over the opposite lane, ultimately leaving the roadway. After leaving the road, the vehicle struck a ditch and finally a tree, where it came to final rest facing north off of the southbound roadway. The vehicle was towed from the scene due to vehicle damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 65 year-old male, suffered non-incapacitating injuries, but was not transported to a medical facility. There were two other occupants in the vehicle in the second row left and right positions when the crash occurred. Neither of these occupants suffered any injuries and were not taken to a medical facility. A partial interview was conducted with this driver while on-scene. He related that after the vehicle started to leave the right side of the roadway, he then overcompensated steering in the opposite direction, causing his vehicle to leave the left side of the roadway. The driver stated that he was familiar with the area and comfortable with his vehicle.
