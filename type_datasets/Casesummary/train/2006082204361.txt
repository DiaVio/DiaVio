This two-vehicle collision occurred on a four-lane two-way street with a two-way turn lane in the center, at the driveway exit from a fast-food franchise. The road is paved with asphalt, and was wet from a previous rain. The road and the driveway are both level and straight, with a line of trees along the road that create a minor sight restriction to the left and right. The speed limit for the road is 48 kmph (30 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Mack Garbage truck, was turning right from the driveway entering the main roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Subaru Legacy was westbound in the second lane of the main roadway. Vehicle one (V1) made a wide right turn from the driveway of the restaurant, to enter the road in lane one. As V1 was entering the road, V2 changed lanes to lane one. The right front corner of V2 clipped the front left side of V1 and V2 deflected to the left. V1 was not towed due to damage. V2 was towed due to damage.
