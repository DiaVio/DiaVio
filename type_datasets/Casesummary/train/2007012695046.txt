The crash occurred off the west side on a two-lane, two-way roadway. There was one northbound lane and one southbound lane. This was a straight, level bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). It was late evening, the roadway was not illuminated, and snow was coming down and collecting on the road.
V1, a 2007 Pontiac G6 four-door with two occupants, was traveling northbound in lane one. V1 started to fishtail and departed the roadway on the left-hand side. The front of the vehicle contacted the ditch where it spun clockwise before coming to final rest facing the opposite direction off the west side of the road. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by an 18-year old male who reported no injuries. He advised that he had left a tanning salon and was on his way to play cards at a friend's house. He advised that he had been traveling between 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph) prior to losing control. He tried to apply the brakes and steer right but could not avoid departing the roadway.
