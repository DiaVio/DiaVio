This two-vehicle collision occurred during morning daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the four-leg intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. Road surface asphalt, level and dry. The east/west roadway is controlled by stop signs. The speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) for north-south traffic, and 40 kmph (25 mph) for east-west traffic. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 2002 Volkswagen Passat four-door sedan, was traveling southbound in the first lane curving right as it approached the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle two (V 2), a 2002 Nissan Sentra four-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the first lane of a two-lane, two-way, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As both vehicles crossed the intersection, the front of V 1 impacted the right side of V 2. Both vehicles moved southwest as they rotated around each other. Both vehicles departed the road over the southwest corner. As V 2 crossed the raised curb, it rotated counter-clockwise and continued forward, where the right side contacted a utility pole, and the front contacted a stop sign post. V 1 impacted the raised curb and continued forward, contacting a concrete wall with its front plane, causing sideswipe damage down the left side. Then the right side of V 1 contacted the left side of V 2 as both vehicles came to rest in contact. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The 37-year-old male driver of V 1 did not provide an interview. His statement to police and a surrogate interview revealed that he did not see V 2's approach in time to take evasive action. He was traveling slightly above the posted speed limit. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
