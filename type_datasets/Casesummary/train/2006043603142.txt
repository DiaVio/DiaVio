This four-vehicle crash occurred in lane two of a 5-lane undivided roadway on a weekday night. The roadway runs north and south, with two lanes for each direction and a center left turn lane, the posted limit is 72 kmph (45 mph). The conditions were clear, dry, dark and traffic was heavy.
V1, V2, V3, and V4 were all traveling north when V2, V3, and V4 stopped for traffic. V1 failed to stop and the front of V1 struck the back of V2. Subsequently, V2 rotated counter clockwise and V2's right side struck the back of V3, then V3's front struck the back of V4. There were no injuries in the crash and V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
V1, a 2003 Acura MDX, was driven by a 17-year-old male that could not be reached for an interview.
V2, a 2005 Toyota Highlander, was driven by a 47-year-old male that was struck from behind by V1 when he stopped. He was driving home this evening after working 50 hours this week. He said the traffic is normally heavy at that time and location. He was stopped for 1-2 seconds before he heard "tires squealing" and felt the collision. The impact pushed his vehicle forward and into the car (V3) ahead of him.
V3, a 1994 Ford Escort, was driven by a 48-year-old male and full time Electrical Engineer that works 45-50 hours per week. He sleeps six hours per night and reports to be in good shape, other than an acid reflex condition that he takes Tricor to relieve.
He was driving home this evening when he was struck from behind by V2. He is not certain if he was completely stopped at the time of the impact but he was certainly traveling less than 5 mph. He was not injured in the crash but his vehicle was towed from the scene because it would not start after the collision.
V4, a 2002 Toyota Tacoma, was driven by a 62-year-old male that was struck from behind after stopping in its lane.
