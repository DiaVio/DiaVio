This single-vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a divided four-lane mountain highway. There are two lanes in each direction. This was a right curve, uphill, cement roadway with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). It was late afternoon on a weekday during evening rush hour and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was moderate.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Hyundai Elantra, four-door with one occupant, was southbound in lane two negotiating the right curve at a police & driver reported speed of 97 kmph (60 mph). The driver of V1 departed the left side of the roadway of a three-leg intersection. There was gravel on the left shoulder and V1 lost control and started rotating clockwise. V1 re-entered lane two, entered lane one and ran off the right side of the road leading with the left side. V1 impacted a snow bank with its left side. V1 came to rest on its wheels facing north at the snow bank. V1 was towed from the scene due to moderate damage to the left side. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.
A 22 year-old male was driving V1, the Hyundai Elantra, and was not injured. He had left a grocery store and was heading up the mountain where he drives rarely to house sit. His health is good and he does not take medication. He is near-sighted and was wearing his glasses at the time. He was well rested, but at the start of this trip he was irritated. The driver saw a State Trooper's lights activated on the northbound side giving a warning to someone and he got nervous since he was driving too fast. This caused him to allow V1 to depart into the left shoulder where his vehicle lost traction in loose gravel. The tires on V1 have worn tread and were slightly under-inflated. The vehicle fishtailed and then he steered hard right causing the vehicle to go into a clockwise yaw and depart the roadway.
