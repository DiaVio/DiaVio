V1, a 1996 Chevy Astro van, was traveling eastbound on a two lane, two way, icy, asphalt roadway. V1 had just exited the expressway and was negotiating a left curve when it hit a patch of black ice and lost control. V1 skidded across the double barrier line, over the painted flush median, and into the westbound lane. V2, a 2001 Ford F-150 pickup, was traveling westbound negotiating the same curve. As V1 skidded into the westbound lane, it rotated in a counterclockwise direction and its right side was struck by the front of V2. Following this impact, V1 continued its counterclockwise rotation and the right rear side of V2 contacted the left front side of V2. V1 then traveled forward in a westerly direction to the right and its front right struck a guardrail. Both vehicles came to final rest off the north edge of the road facing west.
