V1, a 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix, was eastbound in lane three and had just crossed a cement bridge onto the bituminous roadway. V2, 1999 Toyota Camry, was eastbound in lane two of the same roadway slightly ahead of V1. As V1 attempted to overtake V2 it lost control, began rotating clockwise and crossed the right lane line striking V2's left side with its right front corner. V1 then rotated left and struck the median wall with its front left and left side. V2 than bounced off the barrier wall, crossed all lanes of traffic and struck the guardrail on the opposite side of the road with its front before coming to final rest on the shoulder. After the initial impact V2 rotated left and struck the median wall with its left front corner before coming to final rest in lane three.
