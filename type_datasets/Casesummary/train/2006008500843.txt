This crash occurred on a weekday in the westbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. This roadway had an uphill grade of 6 percent and curved sharply to the left. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). It was early in the evening but still daylight, the road was dry, and conditions were clear.
V1, a 2003 GMC Yukon utility vehicle, was driven by a 40-year old male. V1 had just exited a sharp right hand curve and was proceeding up the hill before entering a sharp left hand curve. V1 departed the roadway to the right before it entered the left hand curve. It continued around the curve on the shoulder/roadside where it struck a tree on the right side of the roadway. The vehicle continued through its arc to the left and contacted several mailboxes on the right side of the roadway. It then re-entered the roadway and crossed the entire roadway to the left, exiting the left side of the roadway. After leaving the roadway, it went through a split rail fence and came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
