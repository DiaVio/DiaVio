This single-vehicle crash happened in the afternoon of a weekday on a neighborhood street. The bituminous roadway was curved to the left at the location of this crash and the speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph). The roadway was dry and the conditions were cloudy and daylight.
V1, a 1997 Toyota Celica convertible with one occupant, was northbound negotiating the curve intending to go straight when it departed the left side (west) of the road and struck a tree with its front. The vehicle sustained disabling damage and was towed while the driver refused treatment after EMS arrived on-scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 was a 15-year-old male who borrowed his brother's car this afternoon to meet his girlfriend for lunch. After lunch, he was returning home and while driving through his neighborhood he adjusted/looked at his radio for "a few seconds." When he looked up at the roadway he realized he was on the wrong side of the road so he tried to stop and steer back to the correct side of the road. He admits he was driving too fast to avoid driving off the roadway and into a tree.
This driver had a graduated permit with a level one restriction, which requires the driver to have a licensed driver in the vehicle at all times. Even though this driver was not fully licensed he said he has plenty of experience driving his brother's car.
