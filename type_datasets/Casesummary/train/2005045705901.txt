The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of an east/west interstate highway within an interchange area with another uninvolved interstate highway. There were three lanes in each direction on the east/west interstate where the crash occurred that were separated by a concrete divider wall. A concrete wall bordered the right side of the roadway as well. The eastbound lanes curved slightly right (south) with a radius of 562 meters and a super elevation of 2%. The posted speed limit was 55mph/89kph. The happened in the early morning hours just before dawn on a weekend. It was still dark but there were a few streetlights and it was raining steadily at the time of the crash.
Vehicle #1, a 1998 Ford Taurus, was traveling eastbound on the interstate in the right lane when it departed the right side of the road and contacted the concrete wall on the right side of the interstate and then veered left across all three lanes of traffic and struck the median wall on the other side of the roadway before coming to rest facing northeast about 40 meters east of the first impact straddling the left yellow fog line. Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The Taurus (V1) was driven by a 19-year-old belted male whose airbag deployed. He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of possible injuries but checked himself out before any treatment was administered. His interview is deemed unreliable by the researcher as none of it matched the physical evidence. He also gave a false social security number to police and was charged with no driver's license in possession along with failure to maintain control of vehicle. The driver stated in the interview that he had slept 6.5 hours the previous evening until 0530 that morning but also stated that he had been the only driver from a location 7.5 hours drive away. There were 3 other occupants in the vehicle who were uninjured.
