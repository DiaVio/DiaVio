It was early afternoon on a weekday; the traffic flow was moderate with stop and go activity. The skies were clear and the roads were dry.
V1, a 2007 Chevrolet Impala 4 door with two occupants, was traveling east in lane one, directly behind V2. V2, a 1993 Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle with two occupants, was traveling east in lane one, directly in front of V1. Traveling in front of V2 was a school bus. The school bus was on its traditional route and stopping to let children off. After V2 slowed down and came to a stop for the school bus letting children out at the T-intersection, it was struck from behind by V1.
