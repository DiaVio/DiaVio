This crash occurred on a four-lane, wet, asphalt, roadway. There were two westbound lanes, one that was an exit lane, and another that was controlled by a traffic light. Eastbound traffic traveled on the right lane and there was a turn-lane dividing the two. Traffic was backed-up in the left southbound lane and was stopped waiting for a red light to turn green. The east and westbound travel lanes have a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55 mph), and both have a level grade.
V1, a 1986 Lincoln Town Car, was traveling westbound, in the left westbound lane approaching stopped traffic. V1 failed to stop for the traffic ahead of it and struck the rear of V2, a 1998 Dodge Ram pick-up that was stopped in the traffic lane. V2 had the rear gate in a lower position, and this sustained damage, V1 then contacted a recessed trailer hitch causing it to deform and contact the ground. V2 was than pushed into the back of V3 a 1996 GMC Pick-up, which was also stopped in the traffic lane ahead of V2. V3 was paushed forward striking V4, a 2002 Mercury Mountaineer. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 47 year-old male in good health who was running an errand. The driver stated that he was paying attention, and saw that traffic was stopped but the vehicle just wouldn't stop. Scene evidence did show that leading up to the point of impact between V1 and V2 there were two tire marks apparently from V1 attempting to brake, causing the tires to lock-up. The driver was transported with non-incapacitating injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
