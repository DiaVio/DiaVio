This single vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on the right (east) roadside of an 8-lane divided roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of four lanes in each direction divided by a raised grassy median. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1999 Toyota Camry with one occupant, was stopped facing south in lane two at a traffic signal for an intersection just prior to the crash scene. Shortly after the light turned green V1, accelerated rapidly, veered right and struck the curb before departing the roadway to the right. V1 came to final rest in the grassy roadside in front of a group of trees. A case number was made but the supervising officer categorized it as an incident report, therefore no accident report has been made. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, an unknown male, was transported from the scene before this researcher's arrival. A trooper on-scene stated that the driver fell asleep while he was waiting at the light. He then woke up startled and hit the gas sending his vehicle out of control. Later reports from other personnel on-scene indicated that the gentleman had a medical condition that triggered the events. Subsequent attempts to contact the driver were unsuccessful and medical records were unobtainable.
