V1, a 1999 Astro Van private school bus with two occupants, was traveling north when the driver fell asleep and departed the roadway on the right side, striking a telephone pole and a guardrail. The collision with the guardrail caused the van to roll tree quarter tunes to the left, coming to rest on its right side. The van maintained contact with the guardrail though out the roll. V1 made no avoidance maneuver. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a 61-year-old female who reported injuries to the arm and was also occupied by a 19-year-old male that reported injuries to the neck; both were extricated from the vehicle and transported to the hospital. The driver stated that she had been traveling the day prior to the crash and that her flight had been delayed, causing her to only sleep 3.5 hour prior to going to work. Driver fell asleep, veered off the road, collided with the pole and guardrail before rolling over 3 quarter turns. V1 made no avoidance maneuvers.
