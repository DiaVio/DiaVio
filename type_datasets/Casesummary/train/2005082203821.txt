This two vehicle collision occurred during morning daylight hours. The collision occurred at the uncontrolled intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The pre-crash roadway is level worn dry concrete paving. Both roadways are non-divided two lane road and have posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Toyota pickup truck driven by a 42 year-old male, was traveling northbound on the roadway in lane 1. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford F-250 pickup truck driven by a 18 year-old male, was traveling westbound in lane 1. Both vehicles approached the intersection at roughly the same time, and the front of V2 collided with the right side of V1. V1 then spun clockwise and the front right side of V1 scraped along the right side of V2. V1 rolled backwards onto the northwest corner and came to rest off the roadway. V2 was driven from the scene. V1 was towed from the scene, Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Both drivers stated that they did not see the other vehicle until the crash was imminent. The driver of V2 stated that he looked both left and right before entering the intersection, and locked his brakes before the collision. The driver of V1 stated that she had no time to brake. The roadway for V2 has on-street parking on both sides, and there is not enough space for two cars to pass in opposite directions. The roadway for V 1 is obviously the dominant roadway and has adequate space for two-way travel. Due to the size of the roadways, it is understood that the driver of V2 should have been driving more defensively, as in coming to a stop at the intersection. It is also noted that V2 is equipped with anti-lock brakes, and the driver claimed to have skidded. This inaccuracy brings into question the veracity of his other statements regarding the crash.
