This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday on the right (east) roadside of a two-lane rural roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction flanked by gravel shoulders. The bituminous roadway was dry and level with a slight curve to the right (in the northbound direction) and a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
V1, a 2006 Chevy Cobalt with two occupants, was northbound in lane one. A deer walked out in front of V1 from the right roadside. The driver swerved left to avoid the deer. The driver then steered right to re-enter his lane but overcompensated. The vehicle crossed over the lane and the shoulder and departed the roadway. V1 struck a sewer canal causing it to go airborne. V1 rolled right slightly to the right one quarter turn and struck a series of small trees with its roof. The impacts caused V1 to roll back on its wheels and come to final rest off the shoulder of the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a 32-year-old male, and his passenger, a 52-year-old male, each reported no injuries. The driver advised that he and his passenger had just come back from getting something to eat and that they were on their way back to his mothers house. He told this researcher that he was going at least 97 kmph (60 mph) and that he had a few drinks earlier. He stated that a deer walked out in front of his vehicle and he swerved to the left. He then overcorrected and came back across the right lane, still not having control of the vehicle. The vehicle then departed the roadway and struck a sewer fixture causing the vehicle to roll right. The vehicle then struck a few more small trees, and finally came to rest off the roadway.
