This three-vehicle collision occurred during evening hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at a four-leg, tri-light controlled intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. At the time of the crash it was dark, with no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was traveling eastbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the third lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. V1 was stopped at the intersection and waiting for an opportunity to turn left into northbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Ford Expedition, was traveling westbound in the second lane of opposing traffic, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle three (V3), a 1975 Chevrolet Malibu two-door, was stopped at the same intersection, facing south in the first lane of a two-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. V3 was waiting at the red light, with the intention of turning left. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
When the east and west traffic signals turned to the yellow phase, V1 began its turn as V2 entered the intersection. The front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. V1 deflected northwest and entered the southbound lanes, where the front of V1 impacted the front of V3. V1 then rolled over two quarter-turns towards its left side and came to rest on its top, facing northeast in the first southbound lane. V2 rotated clockwise from impact and came to rest in the intersection, facing east in the first westbound lane.
