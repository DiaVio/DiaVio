This two-vehicle collision occurred during mid-afternoon daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at a T-intersection, where a north-south side street intersects the south curb of an east-west main road. The side street is controlled by a stop sign. Shrubs approximately 1.82-meters (6-feet) tall are at the Southwest corner of the intersection adjacent to a cement sidewalk. These shrubs may have been a partial sight line restriction for both drivers. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan, was stopped facing northbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the first lane of the two-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous side street, about to turn left onto the main roadway into westbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Ford Ranger super-cab pickup, was traveling eastbound in a 72 kmph (45 mph) zone, in the second lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the intersection with the side street on its right. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. The vehicles rotated towards each other, and the right side of V2 contacted the left side of V1 in a side-slap configuration. The vehicles separated, and V1 came to rest facing southeast in the center lane. V2 deflected northeast and departed the road over the north curb, impacting the curb with the front wheels. V2 continued moving northeast off the road, and impacted a chain link fence with its front plane, where V2 came to rest.
