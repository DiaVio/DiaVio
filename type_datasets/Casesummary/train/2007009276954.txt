The crash occurred in the intersection of a 4-lane undivided north/south roadway and a divided east/west roadway. There were two lanes southbound and two lanes northbound. The southbound lanes were level but curved slightly to the left. The northbound lanes were level and straight. The posted speed limit was 48 kmph (30 mph). It was the early morning on a weekday during rush hour. Traffic flow was a little heavy.
V1, a 2004 Honda Pilot utility vehicle with 3 occupants, was traveling north in the second lane of travel. V2, a 2000 Cadillac Deville 4-door sedan, was traveling south in lane 2, attempting to turn left at the intersection. There was a non-contact van stopped in the second northbound lane that was waiting to turn left. The driver of V1 switched lanes to the right in order to pass the van and continue straight through the intersection. As V2 turned, V1 entered the intersection as well. V1 swerved to the right to try and avoid hitting V2 but was unsuccessful. V1 struck V2 in the right front, spinning it about 20 degrees counterclockwise. V2 came to a rest near the curb in the northeast corner of the intersection. V1 pulled off and parked beside V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
