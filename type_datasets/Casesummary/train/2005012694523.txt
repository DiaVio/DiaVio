This crash occurred in an intersection of an east/west and north/south roadway. The east/west roadway was a 3-lane roadway - one in each direction with a left turn lane. The north side of the north/south roadway was 2-lanes - one in each direction, and the south side of the north/south roadway was 3-lanes - one in each direction and a left turn lane. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph) for the east/west roadway and 48 kmph (30 mph) for the north/south roadway. The intersection was controlled by a traffic signal, which was working properly at the time of the crash. It was early evening but it was still daylight. Vehicle #1 was traveling south when it ran the red light, contacting the right side of Vehicle #2 and rotating it counterclockwise. As it rotated, the right rear of V#2 impacted the left side of V#1. After the first impact, Vehicle #1 also rotated counterclockwise before coming to final rest facing north in the intersection.
V#1, a 1996 Chrysler Concord, was driven by a 41-year old female who stated she is in good health and is on no medications at this time and does not wear glasses. She stated that earlier that day she had gotten some bad news and decided to get intoxicated. She does not remember anything about the crash. She does remember coming to in the EMS unit and being told she was in a crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V#2, a 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier, was driven by a 40-year old female who stated that she is in good health, although hypoglycemic. She does not wear glasses. She stated that she was on her way home from picking up her daughter from work and had just left the grocery store parking lot when the crash occurred.
While interviewing the driver of V#1, the researcher heard one of the driver's children (who were playing in the yard) comment that their mother had made them get out of her car just before the crash and had just missed hitting 3 or 4 other vehicles.
