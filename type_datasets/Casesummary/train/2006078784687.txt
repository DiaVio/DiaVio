This is a single vehicle , rollover crash that occurred at approx. 0610 in the northbound lane of a two-way roadway. There was one northbound lane and one southbound lane. This was a straight, level, bituminous, rural roadway with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph).
V-1, a 1995 Honda Accord Ex 2-door, was traveling northbound in the number one lane. The number of occupants is unknown. V-1 entered a clockwise rotation, departed the roadway on the right, entered a hard surface cultivated field, and tripped. V-1 overturned to the left side and completed eight-quarter turns, coming to final rest on the wheels facing in what is believed to be a southeast direction. V-1 traveled about 18.5 meters from trip point to final rest. There was another vehicle at the scene at some point following the rollover, because V-1 was dragged from the final rest position in the field, back to the roadway as indicated by scene evidence. V-1 was then dragged approximately 180 meters south on the roadway until the effort was abandoned and the vehicle was left on the west edge of the roadway, on the wheels, facing south. The crash was reported at 0610 hours of the early morning. It is unknown if any occupants in the vehicle were injured. V-1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.
