This crash occurred in the morning of weekday in the northbound lane of a two-lane undivided residential roadway. Just north of the crash scene the road widens to two lanes each direction. The slightly curved bituminous roadway featured a slope of 3.2% and a speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue sedan with two occupants, was southbound negotiating the curve. V2, a 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan with three occupants was northbound in lane one. An independent witness viewed V1 driving erratically and swerving across the center yellow lane lines. As V1 crossed the center lane line it struck the left side of V2 in the northbound lane. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest on the side of the road facing south. V1 rotated clockwise also and came to rest on a side street partially off the road. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 58-year-old female reported no injuries. The other occupant of V1 had a laceration to his face but was not transported. The driver told police on scene he did not remember what happened. The driver refused to be interviewed.
The driver of V2, a 35-year-old female, complained of pain to her back but was not transported. The other two occupants were not injured. The driver stated she was en route to drop off her children at school. She advised she was northbound and noticed a vehicle heading right at her over the yellow lines. The only evasive action taken was depressing the accelerator. Next thing she knew, she had been hit and her vehicle was coming to a stop in a yard. The driver also mentioned the sun was out and was in her eyes limiting her ability to see.
