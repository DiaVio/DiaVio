Vehicle one (V1) was a 1990 Dodge Grand Caravan occupied by the 24 year old female driver only. V1 was traveling south in lane one of two of an undivided, level, two lane roadway with the intention of going straight. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1993 Saturn SL2 4 door sedan with the 18 year old female driver and two passengers. V2 was traveling west in lane one of an undivided, -3% slope, two lane roadway with the intention of going straight. As the vehicles entered the intersection, the left side of V1 was contacted by the front of V2, causing V1 to begin to rotate in a counter clockwise direction. V1 then began to rollover with its right side leading, and rolled a total of two quarter turns. V1's rollover was interrupted by contact to the top of V1 to a tri-light signal pole. V1 came to rest on its top facing southwest, just south of the intersection. V2 came to rest in the intersection facing southeast. All occupants reported some injury, but none were transported. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
As both vehicles approached the intersection, each driver may have experienced sight line restriction to each other due to a raised yard and trees in N.E. corner of the intersection. Instead, V2's driver stated that the traffic signal had turned yellow upon entering the intersection.
