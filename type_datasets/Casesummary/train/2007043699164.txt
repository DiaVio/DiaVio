The crash occurred on the south roadside of a two-lane, suburban roadway. There were grass shoulders on both sides and a creek on the south roadside running roughly parallel to the roadway. The roadway had a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) with a 3% downhill grade in the eastbound direction. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was midday on a weekend.
Vehicle one was a 2006 Dodge Sprinter step van (GVWR < 10,000 lbs.) traveling northbound in lane one. The driver reportedly fainted just before a section of roadway that began curving to the left. V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway and drove off a four-foot downwards embankment into the creek, impacting the opposite creek embankment with its front plane. V1 came to rest at impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The Dodge Sprinter (v1) was driven by a 45-year old male who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries. He refused twice to be interviewed for this study. According to individuals on the scene, the driver had a history of fainting. The investigating officer estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 56 kmph (35 mph). The Dodge step van was towed due to damage.
