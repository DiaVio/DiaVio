The crash occurred off the road of a right curving highway on-ramp with an uphill slope and a 6 percent super elevation. Dividing the on-ramp from the highway was a progressively narrowing grass median. There was no posted speed for the on-ramp. The westbound highway had a posted speed of 89 kmph (55 mph). This was a bituminous dry roadway. It was dusk on a weekday. Traffic flow was moderate on this busy, well-traveled roadway.
V1, a 1996 Buick Century four-door sedan, was driven by a 34 year-old male. The police on the scene stated that the driver didn't remember anything leading to the crash. The driver later stated that he was going home after leaving work. He claimed he was traveling on the on-ramp at a rate of 64 kmph (40 mph) about to merge onto the highway when the vehicle began to make a loud whistling sound. The airbags suddenly exploded, disabling the driver. Unable to control his vehicle, it continued forward veering right, over the shoulder and off the road, across a depression and up a hillside 8 meters, hitting a tree before coming to rest. There were no skid marks or evidence that the driver attempted avoidance maneuvers. There was no evidence to prove that the airbags deployed prior to the impact with the tree. The driver was arrested and removed from the scene by police. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
