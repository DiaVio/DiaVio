Case #2007-086
The crash occurred at a three-legged, y-shaped intersection. This was a two-way, two-lane, undivided roadway in all directions. These were straight, level, asphalt roads, with a posted speed of 40 kmph (25 mph) in all directions. There were no traffic controls leading northbound into the intersection. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with wet roads (morning dew) and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1, a 1999 Toyota Tacoma with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one, approaching the intersection. In the pickup bed of the truck, was a 300-lb. four-wheeled ATV. As the vehicle entered the y-intersection, the driver attempted to make a left turn. The left front tire blew, causing the driver to lose control. The vehicle departed the end of the roadway. The front of V1 made contact with a chain-link fence. The vehicle continued to travel northbound, onto a residential property. The front of V1 then made contact with the back of an SUV, which was parked in the driveway of the property owner's home. V1 continued in a northern direction. The front of V1 then made contact with a corner of the house, where the Tacoma came to final rest. V1 was towed due to damage.
The Toyota Tacoma was driven by a 23-year old male, who declined to be transported for his injuries. He stated that he was on his way to a friend's house that morning, where he was going to wait for the local bike shop to open, so that he could purchase a helmet. The driver indicated that one of his front tires blew as he attempted to make a left turn, causing him to lose control. The driver said that he slammed on the brakes, but the roadway and grass were wet from morning dew, and he slid off the end of the roadway. The driver remembered hitting a chain-link fence, parked vehicle, and finally a house.
