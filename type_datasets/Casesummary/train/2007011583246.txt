This single vehicle, weekday, morning crash occurred off the right side of a ice covered, rural, 2 lane, 2 way, level, gravel/slag roadway. At the time of the crash it was cloudy and daylight. The speed limit was 89 kmph (55mph).
V1, a 1999 Jeep Wrangler solely occupied by the 17-year-old male driver, was southbound, negotiating a left hand curve on the roadway described above. After entering the curve, V1 began a counterclockwise yaw. The driver steered right then left then right again trying to regain control but the vehicle exited the curve in a clockwise yaw and slid off the right side of the road with the driver's side leading. As it left the roadway V1 hit the snow bank along the edge of the road and became airborne. When it landed, left side leading, V1 tripped and rolled to the left. The roof struck a small tree but V1 continued to roll to the left a total of 6 quarter turns before coming to final rest on its roof facing north-northwest. The driver sought his own medical attention. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that he goes that way to school everyday and had left at his usual time. He did not have the 4-wheel drive option engaged and maybe went into the curve too fast. He was thinking about a physics test that he had that morning and was not thinking about the icy condition of the road. He said he tried to steer out of the skid but could not and finally left the roadway to the right with the left side leading.
