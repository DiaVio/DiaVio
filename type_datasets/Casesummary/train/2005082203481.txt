V1 then veered into V 2, striking V 2 with the left front corner of V 1, and breaking the left front suspension and causing the left front tire to pull to one side. V1 then continued forward, sliding along the right side of V2, then the right side of V3. As V1 slid past V4, components of V1 cut the sidewall of V4 and scratched the right side of V4.
