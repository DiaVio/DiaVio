The crash occurred at the intersection of a four lane urban arterial road and a two-lane secondary side street. The arterial was straight and level and ran north/south. It had a 2.4m right shoulder and business driveways were on both sides of the road. The straight two-lane side street intersected from the west at a positive 14 percent grade and was controlled by a stop sign. Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was a 2004 Subaru Impreza going eastbound on the side street intending to turn left and go north on the four lane arterial road. Vehicle #2, a 1991 Ford Escort, was southbound in the left lane of the arterial. Vehicle #1 came to a stop at the stop sign, but the drivers view was partially blocked by a non-contact tractor-trailer that was making a right turn from the four-lane artery to the side street. Vehicle #1 initiated the left turn and its front struck the right side of Vehicle #2. Both vehicles came to rest near impact facing their initial directions and were towed due to damage. There were no injuries in the collision.
