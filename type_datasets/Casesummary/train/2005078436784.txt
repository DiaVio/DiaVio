This two-vehicle rear-end configuration crash occurred in the afternoon on a clear day in the number one eastbound lane of a two way, five-lane, dry, straight, level, bituminous asphalt roadway. The roadway has two westbound and two eastbound lanes that are separated by a continuous left turn lane. The posted speed limit on the roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph). There were no sight line restrictions, adverse weather conditions, or road defects that contributed to this crash, however, the traffic was congested.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Accord 4 door, was traveling eastbound in the number one lane at approximately 32 kmph (20 mph) about 6.1 meters (20 feet) to the rear of V2. The second row middle passenger, a 7-month-old female restrained in a child safety seat, began to cry. The restrained V1 driver, a 25 year old female, looked in the rear view mirror to check on the child. Upon redirecting her attention forward, the V1 driver noticed that V2 had begun to decelerate because traffic ahead was in the process of stopping for a red traffic signal. The V1 driver applied her brakes, but was unable to stop and the front of V1 and back of V2 collided. V1 came to rest in the roadway and was later removed from the roadway to accommodate traffic. The other V1 occupant, a restrained 22-year old female, occupied the right front seat. V1 was towed due to damage. There were no injuries reported by the V1 driver or passengers. The V1 driver was cited for Failure to Control. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Infiniti QX4 4 door SUV, was traveling eastbound in the number one lane and braked as traffic ahead began to slow for a red traffic signal ahead. The back of V2 was struck by the front of V1. V2 came to rest in the eastbound lane and was later driven from the crash scene. The restrained V2 driver, a 33-year old female, was transported from the scene by EMS where she complained of pain to her back.
