The crash occurred on an east/west barrier divided urban interstate inside a construction zone. Eastbound there were three travel lanes with a one-lane entrance ramp merging from the south. A barrier divided them from three westbound lanes. There are no shoulders or lighting due to the construction. The interstate was straight with a 1.4% downgrade for eastbound travelers. Traffic counts from 2003 indicate the six interstate lanes carry 142,840 vehicles per day. The posted speed was 72kph (45mph). Conditions were dark and dry on a weekend night.
Vehicle #1 was a 1995 Toyota Corolla traveling east in the right lane. Vehicle #2, a 2004 GMC Envoy SUV, was eastbound in the right lane in front of Vehicle #1.
