The driver of v1 stated that as he was westbound in lane 2 in stop and go traffic going 10-20 mph, he saw traffic coming up behind him and so put on his flashers to warn them of slowing traffic. As he looked back he saw that v2 was stopped. He braked but could not stop in time to avoid v2. He was on his way home and was in his work van. He was not late and was familiar with the road.
The driver of v2 stated that he and a friend had just come from dropping off his sister at the airport and were on their way back home to a town about 80 miles away. He said he was westbound, in stop and go traffic, and had stopped briefly. Just as he was getting ready to go again he glanced into his rearview mirror, saw v1 coming and knew he was going to get hit. He had no time to take any avoidance actions.
