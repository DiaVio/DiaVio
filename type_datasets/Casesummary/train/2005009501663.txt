This crash took place during the early afternoon of a holiday on a four lane divided roadway. There were two eastbound lanes and two westbound lanes divided by a median. Conditions were daylight and dry and the roadway had a posted speed limit of 30mph (48kmph).
V1, a 1992 Honda Accord, was traveling west in lane one negotiating a curve right. Just after passing the apex of the curve this vehicle lost control and departed the roadway to the right. V1 struck the curb, then struck an overhead light pole before re entering the roadway and coming to rest in its original travel lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
V1 was driven by a 17 year-old male who stated that his mother had left the house and left her keys to the car at home. He took the car without her permission and was going to his friends house. The driver stated that as well as being fun, he was driving too fast to get back home before his mother. Just prior to the crash the driver was on his hand held cell phone telling his friend that he was almost there. This driver was operating the vehicle with a drivers permit which had a restriction demanding proper supervision.
