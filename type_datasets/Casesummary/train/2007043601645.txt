This two-vehicle crash occurred in the late afternoon of a weekday in lane one of a two-lane divided roadway. The main thoroughfare is an east/west divided roadway that is straight with a downhill slope and posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). At the location of this crash, there is an intersecting north/south side street. The conditions were clear, dry, and daylight.
V1, a 2003 Mitsubishi Galant with one occupant, was eastbound in lane one behind V2, a 1995 Ford Explorer with one occupant. V2 was decelerating so it could make a right turn at the side street when it was struck from behind by V1. V2 continued to rotate clockwise, strike a curb and roll over onto its roof. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage and both drivers were transported to the hospital. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 22-year-old female and full time cosmetology student that was on her way to visit her boyfriend when she was involved in this crash. She reports that she was traveling east in lane one when “somehow she crashed into the back of a black truck.” She could not remember any details about the crash and said the truck “came out of nowhere.”
