This three-vehicle crash occurred in the evening hours on a westbound, four-lane, straight, level expressway bordered by paved shoulders. A jersey barrier separates this westbound roadway from the eastbound roadway. The speed limit on this roadway is 89 kmph (55 mph).
Vehicle one, a 2005 Nissan Altima, was westbound in the second lane. Vehicle two, an unknown van, was westbound in the third lane. Vehicle three, an unknown vehicle was westbound in lane three behind vehicle two. The driver of vehicle one stated that vehicle two suddenly merged into her lane, striking the front left corner of her vehicle. This impact pushed her vehicle partially out of her lane to the right (north). The driver of vehicle one over-corrected back to the left and traveled southeast across lanes three and four. As she crossed lane three, the front of vehicle three struck the back left corner of vehicle one. The front of vehicle one then struck the median jersey barrier. Vehicle one rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest between lanes three and four, facing southeast. Vehicle one was towed due to damage. Vehicles two and three fled the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of vehicle one, an eighteen-year-old female, was driving from school to her home. She was familiar with both the vehicle and the roadway, driving daily to and from school. The night prior to the crash, she received over eight hours of sleep, so fatigue is not considered an issue. This driver drives this vehicle daily and over this road on a daily basis.
The drivers of vehicle two and three left the scene and were not interviewed.
