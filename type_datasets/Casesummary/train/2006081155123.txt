A two-vehicle intersection collision occurred just after noon on a Monday. The collision occurred in a busy intersection controlled by traffic control signals with pedestrian signals. The north/south leg of the intersection for vehicle one (V1) is a two-way, six-lane undivided roadway. The pre-crash roadway for V1 is a level, and straight, with bituminous paving. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 64 kmph (40 mph). The pre-crash roadway for vehicle two (V2) is a two-way, seven-lane, undivided roadway. The pre-crash roadway for V2 is a level and straight with bituminous paving. The posted speed limit for V2 is 64 kmph (40 mph). Access to the roadway is not controlled.
V1, a 2002 Toyota Corolla 4 door with two occupants, was headed south through the intersection. V2, a 2003 Chevy Trailblazer with one occupant, was stopped for the light, facing east. The light for V2 turned green and V2 proceeded into the intersection. The front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. None of the occupants were transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 was a 56 year-old female whose pre-crash factors are unknown, as she was not interviewed, due to language barrier. She stated to the investigating officer she was not sure where she was going and was following another vehicle. The driver ran the red light at the collision intersection.
The driver of V2 was a 44 year-old male who is reportedly in good health, with no hearing or sight restrictions. He stated that his light was red, and that he had just proceeded forward when it turned green. He didn't see the other vehicle until the last second and applied the brakes. He was on his way back to the plant he works for, and he had just left a sales call less than 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) away. He is very familiar with the vehicle and the roadway, as he drives both every day.
