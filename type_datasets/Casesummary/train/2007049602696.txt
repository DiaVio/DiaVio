This single vehicle crash occurred on a weekend during afternoon hours. The location was a divided, straight north-south trafficway. Both roadways consist of three lanes. The entries of business parking lots were located east and west of the roadway. The weather was clear and the roads dry. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 56 kph (35 mph). The southbound lanes have a downhill grade of 2.5 %.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Jaguar XJ-6, was leaving a parking lot located east of the roadway. The driver turned left from the parking lot into the southbound lanes of traffic. V1 partially entered lane two, crossed lane three rotating counterclockwise. V1 traveled onto the median and the front of the vehicle struck a light pole. It came to rest at the light pole facing northeast. The vehicle was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
A 32-year old male was the driver of V1. He seemed very agitated and refused to be interviewed. He told police on location another vehicle leaving the business parking lot located west of the roadway cut into his lane and caused him to lose control.
A witness working at a nearby business (located at the parking lot) was interviewed at the scene. He stated that traffic was light at the time of the crash and that there was no southbound traffic. He observed that V1 had enough space and time to turn left into the southbound lanes. While sitting at the parking lot exit, the driver revved the engine and turned left with rapid acceleration. The witness did not see the impact with the light pole but heard the tires screech prior to the impact. Vehicle skids found at the scene indicate the vehicle was in a yaw as it attempted the left turn at a high rate of speed. The driver lost directional control.
