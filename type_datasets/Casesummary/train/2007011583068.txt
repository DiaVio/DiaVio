The single vehicle, weekday, midmorning crash occurred in lane 1 of 2 southbound lanes of a straight, level, bituminous, 4-lane interstate roadway with a median with a positive barrier (metal guardrail). At the time of the crash it was daylight, cloudy and the roadway was dry. Traffic was moderate and the posted speed limit was 113 kmh (70mph).
V1, a 2002 Chevrolet Malibu solely occupied by a 28 year-old female driver, was southbound in lane of the roadway described above. V1 struck a wooden box/cabinet with its front right then went left across lane 2 striking the metal guardrail just off the inside shoulder. The driver of v1 then steered right, re-entered the roadway and went into a clockwise yaw. V1 slid sideways, left side leading, off the right side of the road down a negative grade of 39% approximately 3-4 feet where the tires caught and v1 tripped rolled left side leading 2/4 turns. V1 came to rest on its roof facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that she had just gotten on the interstate and was traveling southbound in lane 1 at about 73mph when she saw an object in her lane ahead. (She had the day off and was going to a hair appointment and anticipating a visit from her boyfriend later that day that was coming from out of state.) She started braking and at the last minute swerved left but still struck the wooden box. She brushed the guardrail and steered right to re-enter the road and overcorrected. She said the car went off the right side of the road and flipped onto its roof. She said she was not in a hurry and drives that roadway daily.
