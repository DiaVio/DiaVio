The three-vehicle rear-end collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday. At the time of the crash there were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Plymouth Voyager minivan, was traveling westbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the second lane of a four-lane (two westbound lanes, two eastbound), two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching slower traffic ahead. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Nissan Altima four-door sedan, was stopped ahead of V1 in the same lane. Vehicle three (V3), a 1996 Honda Accord four-door sedan, was stopped ahead of V2 in the same lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
As V1 approached V2, the driver's attention was diverted to his rear-view mirror, where he was looking at the vehicle immediately behind him. His attention retuned to the forward view too late to stop, and the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. V2 moved ahead and impacted the back of V3. All three vehicles came to rest generally in their original travel lane.
