This is a single vehicle rollover collision that occurred on in the two eastbound lanes of a divided interstate roadway. The lanes are separated by a painted centerline stripe and bordered by asphalt shoulders on either side. The posted speed limit on the roadway was 120 kmph (75 mph). The crash occurred during morning daylight hours. The travel lanes were straight, level and dry.
Vehicle one (V1) was a 1997 Ford 2 door Explorer 4x2 SUV. V1 was traveling eastbound in the number two lane when the vehicle began to shake violently. The driver then slowed down by applying the brakes with no lock-up. The vehicle then traveled into the number one lane and then back into the number two lane. The vehicle then rotated clockwise and departed the roadway onto the north shoulder. The vehicle tripped and rolled for 5 quarter turns coming to rest on it's left side on the north shoulder facing south. The inside of the left rear wheel was damaged and the tire was flat. The other wheels did not appear to be damaged. The driver was transported from the scene for her injuries. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 121 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 was a 55 year old female traveling with a 58 year old male passenger. They had left their home to look at some new property and stopped for breakfast while on the way. For the last portion of this trip they had been driving about 40 minutes when there was a problem with the left rear tire on the vehicle. The driver has had the vehicle for 4 years and has traveled long distances numerous times with no problems with the vehicle. The driver stated that she arrived at a tire shop the night before and 20 minutes later her tires were rotated and two rear tires were replaced. Images indicated the left rear tire may have not been seated correctly against the wheel on the inside of the tire or the wheel was somehow damaged while in transit.
