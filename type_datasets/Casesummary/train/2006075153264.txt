This three-vehicle crash occurred in the first westbound lane of an eight-lane, positively divided expressway. The highway consisted of four lanes in both eastbound and westbound directions, which were straight and level with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred during nighttime hours with evening traffic congestion. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Mitsubishi Montero compact SUV, was ahead of V2 in the same lane. V3 and V2 decelerated for slower traffic ahead due to stalled vehicles on the paved shoulder to the right. The front of V1 impacted the back of V2. V2 moved ahead and struck the back of V3. All three vehicles came to rest in their original lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
