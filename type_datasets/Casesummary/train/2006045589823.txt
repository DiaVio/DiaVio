Case #2006-45-044
The crash occurred at the intersection of a northeast/southwest two-lane residential road and an east/west two-lane secondary arterial road. Traffic on the residential road was controlled by a stop sign. A raised railroad track crossed the arterial at a sharp grade 30 meters east of the intersection and limited sight distance. Based on the traffic pattern, although a stop sign was present, due to the angle of the intersection traffic tends to treat the intersection as a yield/merge situation rather than a stop sign (the researcher is very familiar with the area). The posted speed limit was 64kph (40mph). Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday morning and the sun was very bright and low in the eastern sky. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire traveling southwest on the residential road approaching the stop sign. Vehicle #2, a 2006 Toyota Avalon was stopped ahead at the intersection. Apparently, the driver of Sunfire (V1) assumed that the Avalon (V2) was initiating a right turn and looked left to see if traffic was clear. Vehicle #2 stopped for crossing traffic and was rear-ended by the front of Vehicle #1. Both vehicles came to rest near impact. Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage; Vehicle #2 was driven away.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 19-year old male that was belted with deployed frontal airbags. Neither he, nor a 17-year old female passenger, was injured in the collision. He stated that the other vehicle began to initiate a right turn and then stopped, just as he was looking left to see if traffic was clear causing a crash.
Vehicle #2 was operated by a 43-year old female that was belted with no deployed airbags. She was not injured in the collision. The driver stated she'd been stopped for a few seconds waiting for traffic to clear when she was struck from behind.
