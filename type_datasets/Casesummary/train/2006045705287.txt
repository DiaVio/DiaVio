This crash occurred just after noon on a weekday in the westbound lanes of a divided interstate highway. The westbound portion of the highway consisted of three lanes flanked by paved shoulders and separated from the eastbound portion by a concrete barrier wall (a guard rail was located on the right side of the highway). The bituminous highway had a positive grade of 5% on the approach to the crash area (which degraded to positive 2% at V1 final rest) and featured a curve left (radius of 592m, super elevation of 3%) with a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55 mph). The road was wet at the time of the crash, as a steady rain had been falling all morning.
V1, a 2002 Hyundai Elantra, was westbound in lane three negotiating the curve. As it continued the curve it hit some water on the road and lost traction. V1 rotated clockwise and departed the road to the left, crossed the paved shoulder and struck the barrier wall to its left with its back left corner. It then crossed all westbound travel lanes to its right and hit the guardrail on the north side with its front. Following that event V1 crossed the interstate one more time and struck the left wall a second time with its left front corner before coming to final rest on the left shoulder facing southwest near the final point of impact. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 25-year-old male who was uninjured in the crash. His right front, 20-year-old, female occupant and the back right 19-year-old female occupant who were both belted were transported to a treatment facility with possible injuries. They were on their way home from a vacation when the driver stated he lost control of his vehicle and struck the wall.
