This is a two vehicle, rear-end crash that occurred during mid-afternoon daylight hours in the westbound lanes of a six-lane, divided roadway separated by a raised concrete divider. There were three westbound and three eastbound lanes with no traffic controls for east/west traffic. This was a straight, level, bituminous, roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This was mid-day on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was congested.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Subaru WRX Impreza 4 door driven by a 17 year-old male with two passengers, was driving aggressively in the westbound lanes - speeding and changing lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Honda Civic 4 door driven by a 58 year-old male with one passenger, had been southbound on an intersecting roadway controlled by a stop sign. The driver of V2 waited for several seconds for traffic to clear and when a gap with no vehicles opened, the driver made a right turn, accelerated to about 80 kmph (50 mph) and entered the number three lane heading westbound. V1 and several other vehicles were changing lanes at a higher rate of speed. The driver of V1 saw the slower V2 in front of him and attempted to avoid by steering right and accelerating. The maneuver was not successful and the front of V1 struck the back of V2. The impact caused the vehicles to rotate. V1 rotated clockwise, crossed all lanes of traffic and departed the roadway on the right as it crossed a low curb. V1 the continued forward and right in soft sand material under construction. V1 continued forward and came to final rest facing generally northwest in soft sand. V2 after impact rotated counterclockwise, went up and onto the raised concrete divider and struck several ornamental cacti in the divider. V2 came to final rest astraddle of the divider facing southbound. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.
