The crash occurred in an intersection of a divided north/south roadway and an exit from a shopping plaza (one lane). In the southbound lanes there were 2 straight lanes and one right-turn only lane that ended prior to the intersection. The southbound lanes were straight, level, and bituminous with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). The intersection was controlled by a flashing signal - yellow for southbound traffic and red for traffic exiting the plaza. It was the early evening on a weekday. The roads were dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was a little heavy.
V1, a Plymouth Neon 4-door sedan, was driven by a 19-year old female who had a 40-year-old female passenger in the vehicle with her. V1 was exiting the shopping plaza with the intention of turning left to travel north. V1 had a flashing red light. After stopping for an unknown amount of time, V1 entered the intersection to initiate the left turn. V2, a 2002 Ford Explorer utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane two. As V1 crossed over lane one into lane two, its left front side was struck by the front of V2. This impact caused V1 to rotate 45 degrees, and the left side of V1 struck the right side of V2. V2 came to final rest facing south in the grassy median that separated the southbound lanes from the northbound lanes. V1 came to final rest facing south in the second southbound lane. The driver of V1 was transported due to possible injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
