V1 a 2006 Ford 500 was traveling south in the right curb lane. V2 a 1995 GMC pickup was traveling westbound in the right curb lane. V1 who had the stop sign traveled through the intersection and was contacted in the left rear side by the front of V2. The impact sent V1 in a counter clockwise rotation and into a power pole. V2 went off the road after impact and stuck a private sign. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 a 32yr old female driver stated that she thought that she had stopped for the stop sign and looked both ways. She then stated that she was on her cell phone and might not have stopped. I tried to get more info about the conversation but she would not elaborate any further.
The driver of V2 a 35yr old male stated that he was going home from work when the vehicle to his right ran the stop sign and he hit it. Upon further talking with the driver he stated that he did not have time to react and that it happened so fast he could not avoid the collision.
