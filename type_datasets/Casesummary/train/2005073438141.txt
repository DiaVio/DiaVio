A two-vehicle crash occurred during early afternoon hours in an intersection of a five lane divided roadway without positive barrier. This intersection is tri-light controlled and has no pedestrian crossings or signals. The southbound lanes approaching the intersection consist of two through lanes and a left turn lane. Just to the north of this intersection the southbound lanes cross another tri-light controlled intersection and then a light and gate controlled railroad track. There is a positive grade approaching the tracks and a negative grade leaving the tracks southbound. The roadway levels out after the tracks and right into the intersection that this crash occurred in. The eastbound lanes consist of two through lanes and a left turn lane at the intersection. The speed limit for this roadway is 48 kmph (30 mph). The road was wet and free of congestion and sight restrictions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Accord sedan, driven by a 54 year-old female, was traveling south in the first lane across the railroad tracks and into the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Buick LeSabre sedan, driven by a 18 year-old female with one passenger, was traveling east in the first through lane into the intersection. V1 traveled across the railroad tracks just after a train passed (when a train is present, the intersection tri-colored lights flash red for the entire intersection). V2 approached the intersection intending on driving through the intersection. As V1 entered the intersection, the right side was struck by the front of V2. V1 came to final rest south of the intersection in the first lane. V2 came to final rest in the intersection facing southeast. V1 was driven from the scene. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
