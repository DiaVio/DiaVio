This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday on the north side of a divided residential roadway. The roadway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a raised grassy median. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with a downhill grade and a posted speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2001 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, was westbound in lane one approaching a “T” intersection. As V1 entered the intersection a non-contact vehicle from the intersecting roadway made a left turn directly into V1's path. V1 swerved to the right to avoid the non-contact vehicle and departed the roadway over the northwest corner of the intersection and struck a tree. V1 came to final rest against tree after rotating clockwise slightly. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, an 18-year old male, reported minor injuries, but declined transport. He advised that he was on his way home from his girlfriend's house, traveling between 34-48kmph (21-30mph) when another vehicle turned left in front of him. He successfully avoided contacting the vehicle but he steered right, which sent him off road and into the tree.
