A surrogate interview was given by the driver's sister and daughter (both of whom had already spoken to the driver at the hospital). According to this interview, the driver was running errands for her daughter while her daughter was at work. The driver was using her daughter's car since she was visiting from another state and did not have her own personal vehicle.
