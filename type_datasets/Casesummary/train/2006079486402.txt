This two-vehicle collision occurred on a weekday during daylight. The crash occurred on a six-lane, two-way bituminous roadway (divided by a two-way left turn lane) near the intersection of a private drive. Traffic coming from the private drive is controlled by a stop sign. The main roadway is designated a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone; there is no statutory limit for the driveway traffic. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound and attempting to turn left out of the private drive. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Nissan Pathfinder SUV, was traveling northbound in the third lane, passing the private drive on its right. In the two-way left turn lane, there were southbound vehicles stopped waiting to turn left into the private drive. V1 intended to turn left, but instead turned right and then attempted to turn left behind the stopped vehicles, in effect making a U-turn. As V1 crossed the third lane, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 deflected right, crossed all southbound lanes, and departed the road over the west curb, damaging its left front wheel. V1's left sideswiped along a small tree before its front collided with a brick wall, bringing V1 to a stop. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
