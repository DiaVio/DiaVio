This crash occurred on a dry, two-lane, asphalt highway with a posted speed limit of 113Kmh (70Mph). The roadway was curved to the right and had a positive 3% super elevation. The highway did not have a positive barrier. The crash occurred during daylight hours and there were no adverse conditions present at the time of the crash.
V1 a 1992 Mercury Grand Marques was traveling in the right curb lane. V2 a 1998 Toyota Camry was traveling in the left lane passing V1. V1 waited for V2 to pass then pulled in behind V2 when he accelerated and contacted V2 in the left rear of her vehicle. V1 went in to a counter-clockwise rotation and departed the roadway to the right side. V2 also went into a counterclockwise rotation and departed the roadway to the left where the vehicle rolled over; two quarter turns before hitting a tree and coming to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 a 24 year-old unlicensed male driver, was driving because a female passenger became sick and could not drive. I talked with both passengers and they both stated that the driver was following V2 and tried to pass her on the right side and that's when the crash started. They also stated that they did not know that the driver did not have a license.
The driver of V2 a 46 year-old female driver stated that she was going to work and passed V1. She then stated that she did not know that it was V1 that had hit her until the police told her at the hospital.
