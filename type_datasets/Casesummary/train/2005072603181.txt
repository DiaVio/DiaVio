V2 was driven by a 49 year-old male was traveling northbound initially in the second lane. The driver of V2 was attempting to turn right (east) at the intersection, but due to the truck's length, the driver had to widen the turn to the left. He changed lanes to the left and the truck straddled the left turn lane and the second through lane. The truck then started to turn right in the intersection where it came in contact with V1. The right front corner of the truck contacted the left side of V1. This caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise in front of the tractor. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2, causing V1 to spin in the other direction (clockwise). V1 continued to the northeast and its front contacted a pole, spinning the vehicle counterclockwise and its right side hit an iron fence. The truck continued on a northeast heading and drove onto the northeast corner sidewalk, striking a streetlight pole with its front end.
