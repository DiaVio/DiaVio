This single vehicle crash occurred a few hours before mid-night during dark hours. The location was the northbound lanes of a four lane urban interstate. The roadway was a negative grade dry concrete surface with bituminous shoulders with a large gore area and an off-ramp on the right side of the main travel lanes. The weather was clear and it was dark with street lights. The posted speed limit was 97 kmph (60 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Buick Rendezvous SUV, driven by a 42 year-old female was traveling northbound in the outside right lane approaching the area of the off ramp. The driver's intent was to exit the freeway to eastbound on another state route. The driver took her eyes off the roadway and looked down to her right while reaching for her cell phone, which was located in the center console. The vehicle drifted into the gore area and struck the end of the Jersey barrier impact attenuator. On impact the vehicle rotated counter-clockwise and rolled to it's right. According to the police report the vehicle made one complete roll coming to rest on its wheels. The driver does not know how many times the vehicle rolled. The vehicle came to rest with the front against the Jersey barrier approximately 65 meters (213 feet) north of the original point of impact. The driver then tried to leave the scene by backing up across both exit lanes, then drove forward and struck the Jersey barrier a second time. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver was transported to a local medical facility. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
