This single-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekend in the southeast corner of a 4-way intersection. The intersection consisted of four multi-lane roadways controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. The main thoroughfare is a 2-lane divided roadway that expands to 4 lanes at the intersection because of its right and left-turn lanes. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and is curved to the left as it approaches the location of this crash. The weather condition was cloudy, dry and daylight.
V1, a 1994 Ford Explorer XL with three occupants, was northbound in lane 2 approaching this intersection where it intended to go straight. The traffic signal for V1 turned red as it approached the intersection and its driver slammed on its brakes, which caused him to lose control of his vehicle. V1 rolled toward the left (2-quarter turns) and came to final rest on its roof. The driver was transported from the scene to a trauma center where he was treated and released for minor injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 is a 34-year-old male that was driving with two of his friends as they were visiting auto parts stores. They were discussing their vehicles as they approached this intersection and the driver failed to notice the traffic signal change from green to red. This driver said that he slammed on his brakes to avoid entering the intersection and causing a "worse" collision but when his brakes locked-up he lost control of his vehicle and it rolled over.
