This single-vehicle rollover crash occurred on an exit ramp of an interstate highway at an interchange leading to another interstate highway. The exit ramp consists of a single lane that is downhill and bituminous, with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). It is at first separated from three through lanes of the highway by a long gore, then completely divided by a jersey barrier, at the beginning of which is an impact attenuator. The crash occurred during mid-afternoon on a weekend day. Traffic flow was moderate and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1988 Jeep Cherokee Laredo with a single occupant, was eastbound in lane two, attempting to exit the interstate, when the driver lost control in the gore area. V1 started rotating counterclockwise and contacted the impact attenuator with the right corner of the front plane. V1 then rolled four quarter turns and came to rest on its wheels facing north in the middle of the exit ramp. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 119 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, an eighteen-year-old female, was driving back to college after spending the weekend at a ski resort to celebrate her father's birthday. She was well rested. This was only the second time she had driven on this road and had only taken this particular exit once before. She used to be very familiar with the Jeep when she drove it regularly, but she now has a different vehicle and has driven the Jeep only a couple of times in the last three months. She said the steering was not like her normal car and gave this as the primary reason for the control loss. She takes Cyclobenzaprine nightly to relax her muscles from her medical condition of cybromyalgia, but said she didn't take it the night before the crash and slept fine without it.
