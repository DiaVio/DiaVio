The crash occurred in the intersection of a one-way, westbound roadway (one lane controlled by a stop sign) and a two-way, north/south roadway (one lane in each direction). Both roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level, with a speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). On this weekend afternoon, the traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
