Vehicle one (V1) was a 1990 Cadillac Fleetwood driven by a 32 year-old female who was westbound in the second travel lane. The driver of V1 attempted to merge into the first lane of travel to her right. A non-contact vehicle was occupying lane #1. When the driver of V1 realized there was another vehicle in the intended lane, she steered to the left, lost directional control of the vehicle, crossed two lanes of travel, drove over the raised curbed cement median, crossed four more lanes of travel. V1 departed the roadway to the south and its undercarriage and right side tires impacted a curb as it was departing the roadway causing damage to V1. V1 and came to rest off the roadway to the south and was towed due to undercarriage and wheel/tire damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver was on her morning commute to work from home and said she was not in a hurry. She was listening to the radio as she was driving and stated she looked in her mirror to see if the right lane was clear and did not see any vehicles at that time. She thought the non-contact vehicle may have been in a blind spot of her mirror. The vehicle dynamics suggest she was traveling at a higher rate of speed than she reported to the researcher. After she realized a vehicle was in the right lane that she started to merge into she panicked and steered hard to the left and was no longer in control of the vehicle.
