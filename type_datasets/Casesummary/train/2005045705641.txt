The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of an east/west arterial road that was straight along the portion where the crash occurred. The road had a grass median that divided four lanes of travel (two in each direction). The road was intersected on the south side by a residential street that had two lanes (one north, one south) with a stop sign controlling the residential street's traffic. The residential street had a positive grade of 4 percent at the stop sign. The arterial road had a positive grade of 2 percent approximately 50 meters west of the intersection just before it leveled off at the intersecting road. The posted speed limit on the residential road was 48 kmph (30 mph). The posted speed limit on the arterial road was 80 kmph (50 mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday, under daylight and dry conditions.
Vehicle 1, a 2002 Cadillac Deville, was stopped at a stop sign on the northbound residential road waiting to cross the eastbound lanes of traffic and turn left to travel westbound on the arterial road. Vehicle 2, a 1999 Toyota Avalon, was traveling east in the left lane of the arterial road. Vehicle 1 attempted to turn left and struck Vehicle 2 in the right side with its front. After impact, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing northeast about four meters from impact in the left lane of the arterial road. Vehicle 2 continued east and was also pushed to its left (north) and ended up in the grass median on the east side of the intersection approximately 20 meters from impact facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
