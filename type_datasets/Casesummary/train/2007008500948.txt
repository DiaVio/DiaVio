V1 was a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee utility vehicle driven by a 21 year-old female. V1 was traveling northbound, when the rear wheel of the vehicle dropped off of the edge of the roadway on the right side. There was approximately a 10 cm drop-off from the road edge to the median. The driver attempted to get the vehicle back onto the roadway, but because of the severe drop-off, the driver overcompensated while steering left. The vehicle reentered the roadway, crossed the single lane and departed the roadway to the left. Its left side struck the concrete barrier. The vehicle was redirected to the right and departed the roadway for a second time to the right. V1 struck a raised mound of dirt that caused the vehicle to roll over. The vehicle rolled four-quarter turns and landed back on its wheels, approximately 7 meters from its tripping point. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
