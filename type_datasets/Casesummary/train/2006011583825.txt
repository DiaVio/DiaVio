This single car, weekday evening crash occurred on the west side of a rural, bituminous, two-way, two-lane, level roadway. This roadway had a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55mph). At the time of the crash the roadway was dry and it was dark.
V1, a 1997 Porsche 911 Carrera with one occupant, was southbound on the above-described roadway. V1 was traveling at a rate of speed approaching 100 mph and passing a non-contact vehicle. As it got back into lane one the driver remembered an intersection up ahead with a “dip” in the road. The driver slowed to approximately 85mph, hit the dip and went airborne. At this intersection the roadway turns slightly to the right. When v1 landed in lane one, southbound, it veered off the roadway to the right. The roadside on the west side of the road consisted of 2 large grassy, landscaped yards containing some smaller diameter hardwood and pine trees planted by the owners. V1 struck a small maple tree with its right side, and while rotating clockwise, struck 3 more maple trees and 4 pine trees while sliding nearly 90 meters. It continued rotating clockwise until it came to rest 16 meters off the west side of the road, on its wheels, facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 137 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 42-year-old male, stated that he was out for a drive in his “hobby” car taking a familiar, rural, route that he used just for leisure. He was familiar with the “dip” in the road and the vehicle speeds described above came from the driver's description of the crash. When he went airborne the rear of V1 kicked to the left so he applied full ABS braking upon landing but could not avoid exiting the roadway to the right. He said he was familiar with the vehicle. A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for v1. He was transported as a result of injuries sustained in the crash.
