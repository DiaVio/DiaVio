Case Note: We attempted to interview the driver of V2 several times but was unsuccessful. We obtained a surrogate interview from the investigating police officer.
The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a four-lane roadway. Conditions were daylight and dry in the morning on a weekday. The posted speed limit was 45 MPH. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was a 1987 Ford Limited sedan traveling westbound in the second travel lane approaching a T-intersection intending on turning left. V2, a 2002 Jeep Wrangler Sport, was traveling eastbound in the first travel lane intending on continuing straight. V1 made the left turn and the front of V2 struck the front-right side of V1 in the eastbound travel lane. V1 came to final rest facing southbound and V2 came to final rest facing southeast.
V1 was driven by a 27-year-old male who was not injured. He stated that he was stopped in the second travel lane waiting to make the left turn. The opposing vehicle, which was in the second travel lane, stopped to let V1 turn. As V1 turned, he did not see V2, which was in the first travel lane. V1 was traveling between 1-10 MPH at the time of impact. V1 was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a 33-year-old male who was transported to a local hospital prior to our arrival and sustained moderate injuries. The investigating police officer stated that the driver of V2 was traveling eastbound when V1 made a left turn in front of V2. V2 braked but was unable to avoid V1. V2 remained at the scene.
