The crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the northbound lanes of a four-lane, two-way undivided roadway. The bituminous roadway featured two lanes in each direction with a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). The roadway was straight with a slight negative grade (-1/61) in the northbound direction. It was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1993 Mercury Cougar, was northbound in lane two. V2, a 1991 Lexus LS400, was southbound in lane two. V2 attempted to go around a slower moving non-contact vehicle by passing it on the left. As V2 attempted its pass it crossed the double yellow line entering V1 lane of travel. The left side of V2 sideswiped the left side of V1. Both vehicles continued forward and came to final rest in the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V2 was driven by a belted 42 year-old male who did not sustain any injuries. The driver received a citation for being unable to provide proof of insurance and he was unlicensed. The driver declined to participate in the study and the Lexus was towed due to damage.
