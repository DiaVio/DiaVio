This two-vehicle crash occurred during early morning rush hour on a four-lane, divided, concrete roadway. The roadway surface was wet no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. Posted speed limit 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 BMW 530i sedan driven by a 23 year old female with two passengers, was stopped facing southbound at an intersection. The intersection was controlled by a red-amber-green traffic signal, which was red for southbound traffic at the time of this crash. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Ford Aerostar XL van driven by a 43 year old female, was behind V1 and traveling southbound on a downhill grade. V2 was in the same traffic lane as V1, approaching the intersection. As V2 approached, the driver applied the brakes, but the vehicle was unable to stop due to defective brakes. The driver attempted to avoid a collision by steering right, but was unable to avoid, and the front of V2 impacted the back of V1. Both vehicles moved slightly forward and came to rest in the southbound lanes. After the crash, both vehicles were pushed into a nearby parking lot. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
