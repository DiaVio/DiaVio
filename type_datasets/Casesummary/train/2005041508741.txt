V1, the Isuzu Rodeo, was driven by a 21-year old male who was not injured. The driver stated that when his parents left for church, he decided to get into their vehicle to listen to music. He advised that he turned the vehicle on to listen to music, and somehow the vehicle slipped into gear. His foot was on the accelerator when this happened, and the vehicle lunged backward. He said that he did not know what to do, because he does not know how to drive.
