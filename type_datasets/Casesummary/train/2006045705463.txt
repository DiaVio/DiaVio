The crash occurred on a secondary arterial road that ran north/south, was two-way and had two-lanes (one in each direction). The roadway was level with a slight curve that had a radius measuring 281 meters. If southbound the curve was a curve left (west). The right (west) side of the road was bordered by a ditch that was about 45cm deep. There were no shoulders for the roadway. The crash was in a rural/residential area so there were mailboxes along the roads edge. The east side of the road was bordered by an embankment that had a positive 25% grade with a few small trees and was topped in the area of the crash by a chain link fence. The speed limit on the road was 48kph/30mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were dark, unlit, rainy and wet at dawn on a weekend morning.
V1 was a 2002 Nissan Frontier pickup truck that was traveling south on the roadway when a car (non-contact) that was traveling approximately 30 feet/9 meters ahead of V1 began to brake. V1 then applied its brakes when near the apex of the curve in the road and partially slid off the right roadside with its right wheels in the ditch and struck a mailbox that had a piece of old telephone pole as a post. V1 then corrected left and regained the roadway only to depart the left side, impacting the embankment, a small tree, then a fencepost at the top of the embankment before coming to rest facing east at the top of said embankment with its right side against a tree. The driver of V1 then got out of the vehicle, locked the doors and left the scene on foot. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a thirty-two year old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. His airbags did not deploy. The driver claimed he had accidentally fallen asleep at his moms house the previous night, woke up early and wanted to go home to his residence a few miles away just before the crash.
