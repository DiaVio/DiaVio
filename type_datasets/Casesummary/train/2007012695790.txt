V2, a 2003 Chevrolet Malibu four door sedan with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane two. V2 was intending to go straight through the intersection. The driver of V1 stated that she decelerated, but did not stop before initiating her turn. She also advised that she did not see V2. The driver of V2 stated that two vehicles had turned left ahead of V1 but she thought V1 would yield the right-of-way.
