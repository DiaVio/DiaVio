The crash occurred in the late morning of a weekday in the middle of a residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a north/south two-lane divided roadway (controlled by a stop sign and served as an entrance into a housing development) and an east/west two-lane undivided roadway (no control devices). Both roadways were dry, straight and level. The speed limit on the east/west roadway was 64kmph (40 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1979 Chevrolet Malibu Classic, was stopped facing north at the stop sign where it intended to turn left. V2, a 1999 Ford Escort was eastbound approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. As V1 turned left it's front contacted V2's front right corner. After the initial impact V2 was re-directed across the intersection and departed the roadway and struck a tree on the northeast corner of the intersection. V2 came to final rest against the tree facing approximately 14m (46ft.) from the initial point of impact. V1 was moved from final rest before the researcher arrived and was driven from the scene. V2 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

It was only after he entered the intersection that he saw the on-coming vehicle, but could not avoid it.
