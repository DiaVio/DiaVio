This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a 4-way intersection controlled by traffic signals in all directions. Both roadways were two-way, two-lane roadways that were not physically divided. The crash occurred in the mid-evening hours. Streetlamps were present and illuminated at the time of the incident. The roadway upon which vehicle one (V1) was traveling had a slightly positive grade, while the roadway upon which vehicle two (V2) was traveling was considered to be level. The posted speed limit for V1 was 80 kmph (50 mph) and the posted speed limit for V2 was 72 kmph (45 mph).
Vehicle one, a 2004 Toyota Highlander, was traveling west approaching the intersection. Vehicle two, a 1997 Acura CL, was stopped at a red light in the southbound lane waiting to pass through the intersection. When V2's light turned green, it entered the intersection, at which time the front of V1 contacted the left side of V2. The impact sent V2 up a nearby driveway before coming to final rest. Vehicle one spun counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees after the first impact and then made contact with a stone wall at the entrance of the driveway. After hitting the wall, V1 then proceeded to roll backward, coming to final rest in the middle of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
