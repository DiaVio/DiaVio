The crash occurred in lane 2 of a 2-lane eastbound interstate divided by a grass median (4 lanes total). The eastbound lanes were straight, level, dry cement. At the time of the late afternoon, weekday crash, it was dusk, there were no adverse weather conditions and the rush hour traffic was heavy. The posted speed limit was 113 kmph (70 mph).
V1, a 2000 GMC Safari minivan/cargo van occupied by a 20-year-old male driver and a 26-year-old male passenger, was eastbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above. V2, a 2007 Ford Focus occupied by a 21-year-old female driver and a 26-year-old female passenger, was also eastbound in lane 2 of the same roadway. V1's front struck the rear of V2. V1 came to rest on the inside shoulder facing east. V2 went into the median where it came to rest facing east. None of the occupants of either vehicle were injured. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 stated that he had just started working, was in a company vehicle and was traveling to a job site with a co-worker. He was familiar with the vehicle and the road and was not in a hurry. He said that it was rush hour and traffic was heavy. Traffic had just come to almost a complete stop and was speeding back up again to what he thought was the posted speed. Traffic in front of him started slowing again and V2 started braking. He tried to brake but was unable to stop before hitting the back of V2.
The driver of V2 stated that the traffic in her lane had slowed to approximately 20 mph and then was starting to speed up again. She then saw V1 approaching the rear of her vehicle at a high rate of speed so she steered left toward the left shoulder but before she could get out of the way, V1 struck the rear of her car. Her car then went into the snow covered median where she was finally able to bring it to a stop.
