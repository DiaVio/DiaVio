This single vehicle crash happened on a Monday morning on a 2-lane rural roadway. The road runs east and west and has several curves throughout its path. At the location of this crash, there is a curve to the right for eastbound traffic and a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The weather was cloudy, daylight and the road was wet. This morning was the first day it rained in more than five weeks.
V1, a 1993 Ford Escort, was traveling east when it rounded the curve and lost control. V1 spun counterclockwise as it departed the left (north) side of the road and rolled one-quarter time. The rollover was interrupted by a small tree and the vehicle came to rest its right side, facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.
The driver is a 23-year-old female that is a part time college student and part-time worker. She attends class from 8 am to 2:30 pm Monday thru Friday and works an average of 20 hours per week. She woke up this morning at her normal time of 07:00 am and left her home for class at 07:50 am. Her home is less than 2 miles from campus so she was not in a hurry nor was she running late for class. As she drove around a curve, she lost control of her car on the wet road and began to “fishtail” and “spin around.” She tried to regain control of her vehicle by braking and steering left and right, but she could not get correct the spin and drove off the left side of the road. Her vehicle rolled down an embankment and came to final rest on the passenger side. She was not injured in the crash but her vehicle was towed from the scene.
