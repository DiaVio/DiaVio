This single vehicle crash occurred early evening at dusk on a two-lane dirt roadway located in a rural area with various curves and grades. the sun was beginning to set with the sun shining directly into the drivers face. This roadway is initially straight and then has a left hand curve. The posted speed limit is 40 kmph (25 mph) with no edge lines but there were reflective chevron signs posted just before the curve. There is a sharp drop-off on the right road edge with a non-transversable slope of -38% with large boulders and medium sized trees.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe 4 door, was driven by a 24 year-old male with two passengers. V1 was traveling westbound descending the -6 % grade when the sun glare hit the bug smeared windshield. The driver was traveling about 56 kmph (35 mph) when the sun glare blocked the driver's view of the road ahead. The driver continued straight thinking this roadway went straight. The roadway curved left and as the driver approached this curve the sun glare suddenly lifted and the driver realized he was going too fast to successfully negotiate the curve. The driver braked and steered left but the dirt roadway did not give much traction, so V1 continued straight and off the right road edge. As V1 began to exit the road edge it impacted a chevron warning sign. V1 rode the road edge a short distance then as it was coming to a stop on the road edge, it began to roll over towards the right side. V1 rolled 3 quarters coming to rest on the driver's side heading in a northerly direction. V1 was towed for damages and the driver was issued a citation for speed not reasonable and prudent. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
