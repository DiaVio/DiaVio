This two vehicle daytime collision occurred at 0743 hours. The crash occurred at the intersection of a 2 lane undivided roadway and an unmarked two-way side street. The roadway for is straight and level concrete paving. The east/west roadway has a uphill grade of 11%. The main roadway is an arterial with a non-posted speed limit of 48 Kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle 1 (V 1), a 1985 Honda Accord sedan, driven by a 48 year-old female was stopped at the stop sign, waiting to turn left. Vehicle 2 (V 2), a Chevrolet C1500 large pickup, driven by a 35 year-old male was heading east towards the intersection up the hill. V 1 proceeded into the intersection and turned left, striking the front of V 2 with the left front corner. The driver of V 1 maintained that she was turning right, and that she never saw V 2 coming. She refused to complete the interview on-scene, and avoided subsequent attempts to interview her. On-scene, it was obvious that V 1 was turning left and that she failed to yield to V 2 as it was approaching. Due to parked cars on the side street and along the main roadway, vehicles approaching the intersection will not be seen by vehicles stopped at the stop sign. However, careful observation of the intersection for a couple of seconds would eliminate the possibility of cars coming from the left. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
