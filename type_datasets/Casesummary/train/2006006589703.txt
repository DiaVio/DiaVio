This crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the middle of an urban T-intersection. The intersection consisted of an east/west, two-way, four-lane divided (embedded trolley tracks) roadway and a north/south two-way, two-lane terminating roadway controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. Both roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level with posted speed limits of 40kmph (25 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2004 Honda Civic, was westbound approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V2, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am, was eastbound approaching the same intersection where it intended to turn left. As V2 turned through the intersection its front contacted the left front corner of V1. After the initial impact, V1 rotated counter-clockwise it came to final rest in the intersection near the point of impact. V2 also rotated counter-clockwise and came to final rest near the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 23-year old female, was aware of the oncoming traffic and travels on the roadway daily. The police listed her travel speed at 40kmph (25 mph). She remembered traveling northbound, through the intersection, when suddenly V2 turned in front of her before she had a chance to react. She said vehicles suddenly turn in front of her on this intersection all the time to get onto the expressway. This time however she was unable to hit her brakes in time. She was not injured, but V1 was towed due to damage.
The driver of V2, a 25-year old male who after several attempts, could not be reached for an interview. He was transported directly to the hospital with moderate injuries and V2 was towed due to damage.
