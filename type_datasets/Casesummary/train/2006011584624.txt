This crash occurred in the mid-morning of a weekend just past the junction of a single lane curved exit ramp and a single lane, northbound collector (that was separated from two northbound lanes of an expressway by a concrete barrier wall). The bituminous collector was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 113kmph (70 mph). The roadway was still wet from a rain that had fallen earlier. It was cloudy and overcast at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix , was negotiating the right curve of the exit ramp preparing to merge onto the collector. As V1 entered the collector it lost control, skidded across the collector, and exited the roadway to the left before striking the barrier wall. V1 then bounced back across the collector lane to the right, exiting the roadway to the right and struck the guardrail first with its front and then with its right rear corner before coming to final rest against the guardrail. The driver (and single occupant) of v1 was slightly injured and checked out by EMS at the scene. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 25 year-old female who was on her way to pick up her daughter. She stated that she was traveling near the speed limit when she lost control of vehicle as she merged onto the collector. She attempted to regain control by braking and steering to the left and to the right however she was unsuccessful and according to her “closed her eyes and held on” as she hit the wall. She suffered minor injuries, which were treated at the scene, and V1 was towed due to damage.
