There were no traffic controls. The roadway was straight with an uphill grade measuring +7.3%. The posted speed was 50mph (80kph). There was also an intersecting 2-way, 2-lane road on the right with an uphill + 17.7% grade. It was dark, not lit on a weeknight with no adverse weather conditions.
Vehicle #2 was a 1998 GMC 3500 pickup truck with a crew cab carrying 4 occupants other than the driver. Vehicle #2 was northbound in the right lane and had slowed considerably (>5mph) to turn right onto a side road with a very steep grade. Vehicle #1 was a 1998 Ford Contour also traveling northbound in the right lane. Vehicle#1 ran into the back of Vehicle #2 coming to final rest at POI. Vehicle#1 was towed from the scene with both airbags deployed. Vehicle#2 was driven from the scene with minor damage and no airbag deployment. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The 47-year old female driver of Vehicle #1 was belted and uninjured. She stated that “he (V2) was stopped in the road or going really slow to turn there and I didn't have time to stop”. There was no other traffic around at the time of the crash.
The 25-year old male driver of Vehicle#2 was belted and uninjured. He said that he slowed down considerably because of the steep grade of the intersecting road that he was preparing to turn onto combined with the fact that this was the first day that he owned the truck and did not wish to “bottom out” by going too fast.
