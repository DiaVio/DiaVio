The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a ten-lane interstate roadway, which was divided by a concrete traffic barrier. There were five southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt 4-door sedan with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. A non-contact truck was traveling southbound in lane two, just slightly ahead of V1. Another vehicle, traveling in lane three, abruptly changed lanes to the right, cutting off the truck. The truck then took an evasive action to the right, cutting off V1. V1 veered to the right, successfully avoided the truck, but traveled off the roadway. The front of V1 made contact with a guardrail. V1 rotated clockwise, still on the emergency shoulder. The back left corner of V1 made contact with the guardrail once more, before coming to final rest on the emergency shoulder, facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The Chevy Cobalt was driven by a 36-year old male who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way to a friend's house. Traffic was moving between 64 and 80 kmph (40 to 50 mph). The driver was unsure whether he was in the far right lane, or the one next to it. He and the driver of the truck each confirmed at the crash scene that the truck driver was cut off by another driver, forcing the truck driver to veer into V1's travel lane, subsequently causing the driver of V1 to take evasive action.
