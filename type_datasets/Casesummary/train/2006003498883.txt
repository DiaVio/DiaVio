This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday in the middle of an urban intersection. The intersection consisted of a northbound one-lane one-way roadway and a westbound one-lane, one-way roadway controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. All the roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). It was daylight and clear with no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2006 Chrysler 300C, was northbound approaching the intersection, where it intended to go straight. V2, a 2003 Seagrave Fire-truck, was westbound with its emergency lights and sirens on approaching the same intersection where it also intended to go straight. As V2 crossed through the intersection it was struck on the left side by the front of V1. V1 came to a final rest in the intersection near the point of impact while V2 came to a controlled stop just west of the intersection.
