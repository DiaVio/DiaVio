The crash occurred on a two-way four-lane road (2 lanes each direction) that runs east/west and is divided by a raised grass median. The grass median is broken intermittently with crossovers for turning traffic. The road was straight and level, running through a business district with a bank driveway intersecting from the south. The posted speed limit is 48kph/30mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry on a weekday in early afternoon.
Vehicle 1 was a northbound 2001 Ford Taurus waiting to turn left (west) from the bank lot when a non-contact vehicle stopped in the right eastbound lane and waved Vehicle 1 out. Vehicle 1 proceeded to pull out when Vehicle 2, a 1998 Ford Escort that was traveling east in the left lane, struck Vehicle 1 on the left side with its front. Both vehicles came to rest within a meter of impact facing their original directions. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage and Vehicle 2 was driven from the scene.
