V1, a 2004 Volkswagen Beetle, was traveling northbound on a five-lane, undivided dry, asphalt roadway in daylight conditions. There were three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. V1 was traveling in the second lane of travel, intending to go straight through a 4-way signalized intersection. V2, a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire, was traveling westbound on a three-lane undivided dry, asphalt roadway. V2 was intending to turn right at the intersection. The posted speed limit on both the northbound and westbound roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph). V2 failed to stop for the red light and the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. V1 came to final rest in the roadway. V2 departed the roadway to the left and came to final rest off the west side of the roadway.
