The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a one-way, two-lane interstate entrance ramp. The posted speed on the entrance ramp was 80 kmph (50 mph). The asphalt roadway curved to the left, with an uphill slope greater than two percent. Conditions were dark with streetlights on a weekday evening. The roadway was dry and the skies were clear. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2006 Volvo S40 with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one, negotiating a left curve. A motorcycle was traveling northbound, behind V1 in lane two, negotiating the same curve. The motorcycle was approaching quickly from V1's left rear. The driver of V1 began to change lanes, and then swerved to the right to avoid the approaching motorcycle. The driver of V1 lost control. The front left corner of V1 struck the concrete retaining barrier on the left side of the interstate overpass. This impact was immediately followed by a strike to the left rear of V1, from the same concrete barrier, as V1 was redirected toward the opposite side of the roadway. V1 traveled across both northbound lanes. The front right corner of V1 made contact with the concrete retaining barrier on the right side of the interstate overpass. V1 came to final rest on the right shoulder. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.
The Volvo S40 was driven by a 37-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from school. According to the motorist, he was about to change lanes to the left. As he checked the left lane, he noticed a motorcycle far behind him in that lane. The motorcycle appeared to be a safe distance away, so the driver began to change lanes. However, he had misjudged the high rate of speed at which the motorcycle was traveling. The driver took an evasive action by swerving to the right to avoid the motorcycle at the last second. The driver lost control of his vehicle, striking the concrete traffic barrier on both sides of the roadway.
