This is a two-vehicle crash that occurred at 1528 hours in the southbound lanes of a three-lane roadway that was separated by a raised concrete divider. There were two vehicle lanes and a bike lane for southbound traffic, and a single vehicle lane and a bike lane for northbound traffic. This was a straight, level, bituminous, roadway with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). This was mid afternoon on a Friday, the road was not congested and the sky was clear. There were no traffic controls present. The crash occurred at a three-way intersection between concrete dividers and a barricaded eastbound roadway entrance.
V-1, a 1996 GMC Suburban driven by a 47 year-old male with two passengers, was traveling southbound in the number one lane, slowed and steered right onto the bike lane. V-2, a 1999 Oldsmobile Silhouette Minivan driven by a 16 year-old male, was traveling southbound in the number one lane between 3 and 4 car lengths behind V-1. The driver of V-2 stated that he was driving 40-45 mph. The driver of V-1 pulled wide right and was intending to make a left turn. The driver of V-2 saw V-1 pull over and thought the vehicle had stopped. V-1 pulled out in front of V-2 as V-2 was about to pass. The driver of V-1 made no evasive efforts. The driver of V-2 applied hard braking with lockup and steered left. The effort was not successful and the front of V-2 struck the left side driver door of V-1. The vehicles came to final rest in contact with each other, V-1 left and V-2 right. Final rest was facing east, in the intersection almost in contact with the barricade. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
