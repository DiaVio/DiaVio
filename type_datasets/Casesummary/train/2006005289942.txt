This two-vehicle, rear-end collision, occurred approximately twenty feet from a four-way intersection controlled by stop signs in all directions. All four legs of the intersection consisted of two lanes, (one in each direction) and was not physically divided. It was daylight when the crash occurred and the gradient for the roadway was level. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 40kph (25mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Hyundai Sante Fe, was traveling north on the roadway, just exiting the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Toyota Sequia, was also traveling north just in front of V1. The front of V1 collided with the back of V2. Both vehicles continued forward slightly before coming to final rest. Vehicle two was able to be driven from the scene, however, vehicle one was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of vehicle one, a 24 year-old female, suffered unknown injuries, but refused medical treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash took place. A partial interview was obtained from this driver while on-scene. She claimed that traffic was slow due to a construction site in the area. When she realized a crash was imminent, she applied the brakes, but could not prevent her vehicle from contacting the one in front of her. She stated she was well rested and no health conditions were a factor in this crash.
The driver of vehicle two, a 43 year-old female, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the collision. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. This vehicle suffered minor damage and was driven from the scene before the researcher's arrival. Follow up attempts could not yield an interview with this driver.
