Vehicle #1 was a 1995 Honda Accord traveling southbound. The driver had a seizure and departed the right side of the road. The vehicle struck the curb on the west side of the road before contacting shrubbery with its front as it went down a steep embankment into a pond. The car came to rest facing west in the pond with the front half of the vehicle partially submerged in the water 79m south of initial roadway departure. A witness climbed down the embankment and pulled the unconscious driver out of the vehicle just as his head became submerged. The vehicle was towed due damage.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 19-year old male that was not belted. The frontal airbags in the vehicle did not deploy. He was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries. He stated that he normally takes a medication to control his epileptic seizures, but had not taken it for 1Â½ days. The driver said he had been up until 4am the night before drinking large quantities of alcohol. Doctors told him the combination of alcohol and drugs the night before along with not taking his medication caused the seizure.
