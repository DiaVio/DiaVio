The two vehicle crash occurred late in the afternoon in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a positive barrier. This was a level, concrete roadway with a curve to the right and a posted speed of 97 kmph (60 mph). It was early afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was heavy, but moving at or near the speed limit.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 1984 Chevrolet Silverado driven by a 46 year-old male, was traveling eastbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V 2), a 2004 Toyota Camry driven by a 46 year-old male , was traveling eastbound in lane four. A car in front of V 1 began to slow down for traffic ahead. In order to avoid a collision, V 1 swerved left while locking the brakes. V 1 skidded across lane four. The front of V 1 struck the concrete traffic barrier separating the east and westbound lanes. After striking the traffic barrier, V 1 was struck on the left side by the front of V 2. The vehicles came to final rest touching each other in lane four. The driver of V 1 stated that he had just come from work, and was heading home he was traveling at about 80-97 kmph (50-60 mph) when he made the evasive action to avoid rear-ending a vehicle that had slowed suddenly in front of him. He successfully avoided the non-contact vehicle, but was unable to control the vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
An associated factor coded to both drivers was the traffic flow interruption in the form of the congestion.
