This three-vehicle crash occurred in a 4-way intersection controlled by traffic signals in all directions. Both roadways were undivided with two lanes and a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). It was slightly overcast at the time of the incident, and the roadway was wet from a previous rainfall. The gradient at this particular location was determined to be level.
Vehicle one (V1), a gold 2000 Nissan Altima, was traveling east at approximately 35 mph (56 kmph) intending to continue through the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a white 2001 Sterling street sweeper, was traveling north at approximately 10 mph (16 kph) also intending to continue straight through the intersection. Vehicle three (V3) was a red 2001 Dodge Durango legally parked on the side of the eastbound roadway. As V1 passed through the intersection, the front side of the vehicle made contact with the left rear of the street sweeper. After the initial impact, V1 continued forward and made contact with the back of V3 before coming to final rest. The only vehicle that had to be towed from the scene as a result of damage was V1. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
Since V3 was legally parked on the side of the road, no pre-crash information was required. There was only minor damage to the rear bumper of the vehicle.
