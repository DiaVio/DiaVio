This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekend on the left roadside of a five-lane, two-way undivided urban roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of two northbound lanes and three southbound (with the third lane designated as a turning lane). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 77kmph (45 mph). Traffic flow was slower than usual as it was a weekend day and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1990 Lexus LS400, was eastbound on an adjacent roadway when it turned left at an intersection. As V1 turned left it drifted over several lanes of traffic and off the right side of the road where it struck a large tree. V1 came to final rest at the point of impact against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 48-year-old male who stated that he was on his way home from purchasing some motor oil for his car when he attempted to make a left-hand turn. He stated that his vehicle just started to spin out of control and crash into a tree. This story was not believable due to 2 witnesses that told the police on scene that the driver looked like he had fallen asleep. It was not until the driver received 2 citations for the crash that his story changed and he admitted to dozing off behind the wheel. The driver was transported due to injury and his vehicle was towed due to damages.
