Case # 2005-09-048
This incident occurred on the northbound lane of a two-lane roadway. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 35 mph. Conditions were dark and it was very cold. The crash occurred in the late part of the afternoon. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
Vehicle 1 was a 2003 Ford Focus that was traveling southbound on the roadway behind Vehicle number 2. Vehicle 2 was a 1997 Ford LTD 9000 driven by a 50-year-old male. Driver of V1 stated that Vehicle 2 was coming from the opposite direction and was making a wide left turn onto a dirt roadway. The driver of Vehicle 1 may have assumed V2 was making a left turn and would yield so she continued. V2 turned left and as a result, V1 was struck in the left side by the right rear tire of V2. From the angle of V2's and V1's rest, it would be impossible for V2 to have been coming from the opposite direction and make a left turn and hit V1 from that angle.
V1 and V2 were traveling on the same side of the road going in the same direction. V2 was making a wide right turn onto a roadway and V1 attempted to go around and pass V2. As a result, the left side of V1 struck the right rear tire of V2.
The driver of V1 was transported to the hospital for injuries.
The CDC for V1 is 07LFEW2. The CDC for V2 is 12RWWU1.
