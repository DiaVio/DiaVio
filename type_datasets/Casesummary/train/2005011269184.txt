The crash occurred on a two-way, three-lane, straight and level road at an intersection controlled by an on-colors traffic signal, without a left turn green arrow. Conditions at the time of the dawn crash were clear and dry on the road, which had an unposted speed limit of 89kmh (59mph). Traffic was heavy in all directions.
V1, a 2000 Ford F150 XLT pick-up truck, driven by a 37 year-old male, was southbound in the left turn lane, stopped, waiting to turn eastbound. When the light changed from green to yellow, v1 began to turn left, assuming the oncoming northbound traffic would stop for the red signal. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2003 Honda Pilot, driven by a 40 year-old male, was northbound in lane one in a line of traffic, some of which were turning right. As v2 approached the intersection, the light changed to yellow. V2, traveling at a reported 45 mph, decided to continue through the intersection, assuming v1 would not complete his turn.
As v2 headed straight for v1, both drivers braked and steered to the west, and the front right of v2 struck the front right of v1 in the intersection. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. Both fully restrained drivers denied injuries, as well as the two children in child safety seats in the second row of v2.
