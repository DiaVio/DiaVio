Vehicle 1 (V1), a 2001 Chrysler 300M was traveling west in lane one. Vehicle 2, a 2001 Honda Accord was traveling west in front of V1. Vehicle 3, a 2001 Pontiac Bonneville was heading east and backing into a parking spot. The V1 driver picked up a friend at the train station and on his way back to his residence, he passed out behind the wheel. The driver continued straight in lane one and the left front of V1 struck the right back of V2. V2 steered to the right in an attempt to pull over, and out of the way of V1, meantime the passenger of V1 grabbed the wheel in an effort to steer the car back on the road.

Upon striking V2 a second time, V1 crossed the double yellow lane lines and entered the eastbound lane and struck V3 who was in the process of backing into a parking spot. At final rest V1 was partially in the left travel lane as well as in the left shoulder lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
