Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chrysler Sebring, was westbound in lane two, intending to continue straight through the intersection. V2, a 2001 Ford Taurus, was stopped southbound at the intersection.

Both vehicles rotated slightly and came to rest in the intersection. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, an eighteen-year-old female, was traveling from work to her home. She was healthy, well rested and familiar with her vehicle. She drives this roadway daily. This driver stated that as she approached the intersection, the signal was green. She looked to the right because her lunch bag was sliding on the passenger seat. When she looked back to the roadway in front of her, she realized that the signal was red and that V1 was proceeding into the intersection. She applied the brakes and steered right in an attempt to avoid the collision.
