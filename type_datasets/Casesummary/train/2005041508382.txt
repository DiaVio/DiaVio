The crash occurred at the interchange between two interstates. This was a one-way, two-lane, undivided entrance ramp with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The level, bituminous roadway curved to the right. Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with wet roads and cloudy skies.
V1, a 1995 Saturn SL with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane two, approaching the curve. As the driver entered the curve, the vehicle began to slide on the wet pavement. The vehicle fishtailed, and the driver overcorrected to the left as he attempted to regain control of the vehicle. The vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise as it traveled into the concrete barrier wall. The front of V1 made contact with the wall. V1 continued to rotate until the right rear corner of the vehicle made contact with the barrier wall. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1, the Saturn SL, was driven by a 21-year old male who reported possible injuries, but refused treatment. He stated that he was on his way to work from home. His usual route was congested, so he decided to take another route to work. According to the driver, another vehicle cut him off. Supposedly, he swerved to avoid the other driver and lost control of his vehicle in the process.
