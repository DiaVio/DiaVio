This late evening two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of four-way intersection controlled by stop signs in all directions. The east/west and north/south roadways were each undivided 2-lane roadways that were level and dry. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit on both roadways was 40 kmph (25 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier, was traveling westbound approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Honda Civic, was traveling south, also approaching the intersection. V1 entered the intersection without stopping for the stop sign and its front end contacted the left front side of V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise through the intersection in a westerly direction where it mounted the south sidewalk and contacted an iron fence. After impact, V1 rotated in a counterclockwise direction while traveling in a southwesterly direction and the right side of V1 impacted a paper box and a utility pole. V1 continued rotating until it came to final rest facing northwest in the westbound lane. V2 came to an uncontrolled final rest with the front end partially through the fence facing in a southwesterly direction with the back end blocking the sidewalk. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to crash damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
