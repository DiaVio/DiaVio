This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a five-way intersection. The roadways for both vehicles were asphalt, dry, and level. The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35 mph) for both directions and signalized traffic devices controlled all directions. The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday. The traffic flow was normal and the weather was clear.
V1, a 1991 Mazda MPV Sports Van, was traveling northbound through the intersection when it contacted, with its front, the right side of V2, a 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis, traveling southbound through the same intersection. Both vehicles had the green light. V2 was attempting to make a left turn, cutting in front of vehicle one. After the initial impact, V2 rotated clockwise traveling several feet and making contact with a pole located on the northeast curb edge where it came to final rest. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and came to final rest a few feet from the impact facing east. According to both drivers there weren't any view obstructions. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 31 year-old female, was aware of the oncoming traffic. Due to the fact she rarely travels on this roadway she was traveling below the speed limit at 40kmph (25 mph). She remembered traveling northbound, at a relatively slow speed, through the intersection, when suddenly V2 cut in front of her before she had a chance to react. The driver was not injured but V1 was towed due to damage.
The driver of V2, a 64-year old male, stated he was traveling southbound and while attempting to make a left turn was struck by V1 traveling northbound. He said that he didn't mean to cut in front of V1 but there was a lot of traffic at this busy intersection and thought he could quickly make the turn. He lives in the neighborhood and travels the roadway daily. The passenger was transported to the hospital and V2 was towed due to damage.
