The crash occurred on a fully controlled, one-way, one-lane, right hand curved highway exit ramp with an advisory speed limit of 40 kmh (25 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekend evening crash were daylight, clear and dry with heavy traffic.
V1, a 1997 Dodge Avenger ES 2 door coupe driven by a 19 year-old male, was northbound on the fully controlled highway with two lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median. The driver stated that he was attempting to enter the exit ramp lane on the right. The beginning of the exit ramp lane is also the entrance lane for the northbound highway traffic. Accelerating vehicles entering and decelerating vehicles exiting the highway must merge in the same 155-meter long lane. The driver stated that an oncoming vehicle was matching his speed and not allowing him to get into the exit lane. The witness stated that the driver of v1 slowed at the end of the lane and turned right sharply. V1 entered the ramp, rotated clockwise and left the road on the left side facing west. V1 rolled 4-quarter turns with the right side leading and came to rest 5.8 meters past the trip point facing west. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver was transported to a local trauma center due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
