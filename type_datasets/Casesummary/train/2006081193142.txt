The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a six-lane expressway, divided by a concrete barrier. There were three lanes southbound, and three lanes northbound. The roadway was a straight, level, bituminous roadway; with a posted speed limit of 97 kmph (60 mph). It was late evening at the end of the weekend and the road was wet and it was raining heavily. Traffic flow was light with stop-and-go activity and it was dark with overhead lighting.
Vehicle one (V1) a 2001 Ford F150 SVT 2-door with three occupants, was traveling Northbound in lane three, which was an HOV lane. Vehicle two (V2) a 1993 Chevy Caprice 4-door with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one. The sequence of events is only partially known and it is unknown what caused the driver of V1's initial loss of control. For an unknown reason V1 was spinning counterclockwise out of control, starting from the HOV lane and then across all the number two and number one lanes. The front left of V2 impacted with the left front of V1; V2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and then the right side of V2 near its rear quarter panel impacted the left side of V1. V1 then impacted the right cement barrier with its back plane where it then came to rest against the concrete barrier facing southwest. V2 came to rest forward of V1 facing northbound on the right shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. This sequence of events was based on driver of V2's statement with the researcher, and the damage patterns to both vehicles. There is no police report or other witnesses to further verify the accuracy of these events. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
