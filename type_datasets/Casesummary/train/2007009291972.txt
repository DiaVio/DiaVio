The first crash occurred off the right side of a three-lane southbound highway bordered by guardrails on both sides. The right side of the road had a paved shoulder. The left roadside had a muddy strip of land with a 15 percent downhill slope for drainage before it began an upslope to the guardrail. The roadway was straight and level with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). The sky was cloudy during the early afternoon weekday hours.
V1, a 1991 Honda Accord 4-door sedan, was driven by a 36 year-old male. Shortly after noon, the driver stated that he was traveling south in lane one at a rate of about 80 kmph (50 mph). He was on his way to Home Depot for a work related errand. He fell asleep and his vehicle drifted off the road to the right. He awoke suddenly when his vehicle hit the guardrail along the right shoulder, scraping the right side of V1. The driver tried to correct the direction of the vehicle by steering left and braking, unfortunately, he oversteered. As a result, the vehicle veered to the left, traveled across all three lanes and off the road into and partially under the guardrail, resulting in a one o'clock front impact for V1. Following the crash, V1 bounced off the guardrail and rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise before coming to rest on the muddy grass strip facing north. The driver stated that the shoulder restraint he was wearing unlatched when V1 hit the second guardrail, throwing him head-first into the windshield on the passenger's side. The driver was transported for head and neck injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The researcher tested the vehicle's shoulder restraint and was unable to find evidence of failure. The Honda had an automatic shoulder restraint but a manual lap belt. It was believed that the driver was not wearing his lap belt. The police reported that the driver was wearing his seatbelt.
