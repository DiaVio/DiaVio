This two-vehicle crash happened in the late morning on a beautiful weekday in a suburban part of town. The crash occurred at a T-intersection of an undivided north/south 3-lane roadway and an east/west 3-lane divided roadway that ended at the intersection. A stop sign controlled traffic for westbound traffic; there was no traffic control device for north/south traffic. The traffic level was minimal and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway was 72 kmph (45 mph) and was 56 kmph (35 mph) on the east/west roadway.
V1, a 2005 International tractor with an empty trailer, was driven by a 53-year old male. V1 was stopped at the stop sign intersection waiting to turn south. V2, a 2002 Toyota Camry, was driven by a 52-year old female. V2 was traveling north approaching the same intersection as V1. V2 veered off the right side of the road and crashed into the left side of the tractor. V1 and V2 were both towed from the scene and each driver was transported from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
Neither of the drivers was interviewed, but the researcher was able to discuss some of the pre-crash elements with a witness that was behind V1 and a witness behind V2. The witness behind V1 was the escort driver for the same truck company. He said they had just left a new housing development after delivering housing trusses. He reports that V1's driver was stopped for over 10 seconds when it was struck by V2. While speaking with this witness, the safety director for the company arrived on scene and interrupted the conversation. The other witness was driving behind V2 and reportedly saw V2 swerving before the crash. She said she had called the police before the crash to report a drunk driver. The medical report for V2's driver noted that this driver has a history of convulsions and seizures.
