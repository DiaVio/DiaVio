The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a high-speed/high-volume interstate divided by a concrete wall. There were five northbound lanes and two emergency paved shoulders. The posted speed limit was 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were dry in the mid-afternoon on a weekend.
Vehicle # 1 was a 1996 Mercedes Benz that was traveling northbound in lane one. The driver of Vehicle #1 was reportedly driving at a high rate of speed changing lanes frequently. He stated that he was cut off by a phantom vehicle, which caused him to jerk the wheel to the left into lane #2 to avoid impact. As he cut the wheel to the left, the left front of Vehicle #1 impacted the right rear of Vehicle #2, a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire, which was traveling northbound in lane 2. The impact caused Vehicle #2 to roll over to the left onto its roof, coming to final rest in the third lane. After the initial impact, the driver of the Mercedes tried to compensate and jerked the wheel again, causing his vehicle to roll over onto its roof, coming to final rest in lane 5 facing southbound. The driver of Vehicle #1 was cited for careless driving and the driver of Vehicle # 2 was cited for driving without adult supervision, as she only had a learner's permit. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
The Pontiac Sunfire (Vehicle #2) was driven by an 18-year old female who stated she was traveling in lane 2 when Vehicle #1 smashed into her back right side causing her to roll over. She was transported with minor injuries and her vehicle was towed due to damages.
