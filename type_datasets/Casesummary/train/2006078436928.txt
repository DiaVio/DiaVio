This two vehicle crash occurred just past noon at a four-way, two lane intersection. There is one southbound and one northbound lane. There is one westbound and one eastbound lane that is controlled by a posted stop sign where the two roadways meet. Both roadways are straight, level asphalt with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1963 Chevrolet dump truck driven by a 56 year-old male, was traveling eastbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1990 Ford Ranger 4X2 pick-up driven by a 51 year-old female with one passenger, was traveling southbound. As they approached the intersection V1 disregarded the stop sign and entered the intersection striking the right side of V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise and travel through the intersection in a southeasterly direction. It departed the roadway and began to travel down an embankment into a field. The vehicle rolled to it's left and came to rest on it's top facing in a southwesterly direction. V1 was able to come to a controlled stop on the south shoulder east of the intersection. V1 was removed from the scene on it's own power. V2 was towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
