The crash occurred on a fully controlled rural highway with two-lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median without a positive median barrier. Conditions at the time of the weekday morning crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2003 Toyota 4 Runner Sport Edition 4WD 4 door sports utility vehicle was driven by a 25 year old male on his way from his mother's out of state home to the airport. The driver was eastbound on the road two hours into the 3-hour trip, traveling down >2% grade, on a right hand curve. The driver stated that he thought he looked down into the vehicle (could not remember where exactly) and v1 left the road on the left side and entered the grassy median. The driver swerved back to the right, overcompensated and began to rotate clockwise. V1 re-entered the road on the left, crossed both lanes of traffic and left the roadway on the right side. V1 rolled 4-quarter turns with the left side leading and came to rest on its wheels facing northwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver denied injuries at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
