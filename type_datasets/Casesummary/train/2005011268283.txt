The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane bituminous roadway during the morning hours of a clear, dry weekday morning. The straight roadway had a statutory speed limit of 89km/h (55mph). V1, a 1998 Mercury Mystique, driven by a 40 year-old male, was eastbound on a >2% downhill slope. The driver was observed by a witness slumped over the wheel prior to the crash. V1 left the roadway on the right side, and continued tracking until it contacted the left and right trees of three trees with one base, each >10cm in diameter. The left front door of V1 was removed to extricate the driver, and V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.
