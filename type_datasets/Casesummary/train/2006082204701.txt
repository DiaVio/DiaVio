A two vehicle daytime collision occurred during morning hours on a Saturday. The collision occurred on a five lane two-way arterial street with a two-way turn lane. At the site of the crash, there is a fast-food restaurant with two driveways, and the crash occurred at the second driveway when heading south. The arterial road is straight and level at the site of the crash, and is paved with asphalt. At the time of the crash the road was wet and it was raining lightly. The speed limit for the road is 48 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1987 Cadillac Brougham sedan, was headed south in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Peterbilt tractor pulling a refrigerated semi-trailer, was headed south in lane two. V2 was well ahead of V1 when it moved into the center two-way turn lane to initiate a right turn into the second driveway of the restaurant. After putting on a turn signal and checking for clear traffic, V2 entered the driveway and slowed to ensure the trailer did not strike a sign for the restaurant. As the trailer wheels of V2 entered the first lane, V1 approached and skidded into the wheels. The front of V1 struck the wheels, causing disabling damage to V1 and a subsequent tow. The driver and passenger of V1 were treated on-scene for soreness but were not transported to the hospital. The driver of V2 was uninjured and V2 showed no residual deformation. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
