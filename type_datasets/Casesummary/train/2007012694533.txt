V1, a 1998 Pontiac Grand Am 4-door sedan, was traveling west in lane #2. As the vehicle navigated the left curve, the rear of the vehicle started to rotate counterclockwise. The vehicle skidded over the north curb then rotated counterclockwise further so that its rear struck a utility pole that was 2m off the north curb. The vehicle then rotated clockwise to face south in lane #1. The driver and occupants were not injured in the crash but the vehicle had to be towed from the scene due to damage.

A 16-year-old female drove V1. She reported being in good health and taking no medications. She stated that she wears corrective lenses for astigmatism. She reported that she and her two friends had just left college and were on their way home. She stated that whether or not she drives this roadway depends on what class she is in that day. She stated she only drives this way a few times a month. She claimed that as she negotiated the curve her vehicle stated to rotate counterclockwise. She admitted she may have been going a little too fast for the weather at that time. She stated that the vehicle slid to the right side of the roadway, contacting the curb then rotated further to slide backwards into the utility pole. The vehicle then rotated clockwise to final rest to face south in lane one.
