This single-vehicle crash occurred on an interstate bypass highway with no controls. At the crash site, the roadway is divided by a guardrail and the northbound traffic lanes consist of two through lanes and an entrance/exit lane. This roadway is straight and level, with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred in the early evening hours on a weekend with moderate traffic flow. There is very minimal overhead lighting and the crash occurred during dusk hours.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Oldsmobile Royale 88 with one occupant, was northbound in lane two. A non-contact vehicle, a 1992 GMC pickup, was northbound in lane one, the on-ramp entrance lane. The non-contact vehicle proceeded to change lanes to the left and pulled in front of V1 while traveling at a lower speed. The driver of V1 steered sharply to the left to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise in lane three and traveled onto a paved shoulder and a dirt shoulder before impacting a median guardrail with its front. V1 contacted the guardrail for approximately 4 meters (13 feet) with its front and then was deflected back into lane three. V1 came to final rest in lane three facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a seventeen-year-old female, was driving from her home to meet a friend in a nearby town. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle, and drives this route monthly. She is in good health and takes a birth control pill on a regular basis; she had also taken Advil recently. She stated that she wears glasses to help her see at night but that she didn't have them on yet at the time of the crash. She said she had the cruise control set at 65 mph and that the non-contact vehicle pulled in front of her traveling at about 30 mph.
