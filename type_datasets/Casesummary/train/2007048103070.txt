Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Freightliner truck pulling a flatbed trailer with stacks of lumber, was northbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, was southbound in lane one. V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway. The driver of V1 steered left and V1 returned to the road, traveling over the center lane line. This driver then steered right and the cargo shifted and spilled onto V2 and the roadway. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1 and 80 kmph for V2.
