This two-vehicle crash occurred on a clear day shortly after noon. The east to west roadway begins with seven-lanes then, after a non-traffic signal controlled intersection, narrows to four-lanes. For east bound traffic, the road is down hill after coming off a bridge. There is a raised center divider, that is not positive.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Camry, was westbound in lane-one. As it was passing through an intersection a non-contact vehicle pulled out from the intersection in front of V1 from its right. V1's driver steered left to avoid a collision and crossed over lane two and over the center median into on-coming traffic. V1 was rotating counter clockwise as it crossed the median. It crossed the median and was struck in the right side by the front of vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Oldsmobile 98 sedan, that was eastbound in the number two lane. This impact caused V1 to roll over 1/4 turn. As V1 rolled its back plane contacted the left side of V2. V1 came to final rest on the right passenger side facing Northeast. V2 came to final rest in lane two facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Both drivers were transported for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
