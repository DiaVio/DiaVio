The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a seven-lane (4 lanes northbound, 3 lanes southbound) urban roadway at a four-way, signal-controlled intersection. The roadway had a posted speed of 64 kmph (40 MPH) and the southbound lanes had a 1% downhill grade. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The crash occurred mid-afternoon on a weekday.
Vehicle 1 was a 1996 Ford Ranger pickup traveling northbound in the fourth lane (left turn lane). Vehicle 2 was a 1999 Toyota Camry traveling southbound in the second lane approaching the same intersection as V1. A non-contact vehicle was stopped at the intersection in front of V1, partially obscuring V1's view. V1 proceeded to turn left. The front plane of V2 impacted the right plane of V1. V1 rotated clockwise 90 degrees and then rolled left one-half turn onto its roof. V1 came to rest west of the intersection on the highway onramp. V2 came to rest in the southbound lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 23-year old female who was checked out on scene with minor injuries. She stated that she had arrived at the intersection, stopped, and then the driver of the non-contact vehicle in front of her had waved her around. She had just accelerated into the intersection when the impact occurred. Her pickup was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a 28-year old male who was also checked out on scene with no reported injuries. His passenger was uninjured. He stated that he saw V1 coming into his path of travel and he attempted to steer left around it. V2 was towed due to damage.
