An interview was obtained from a passenger in the van, the driver's sister. This interviewee stated that the driver had proceeded to pass the slower uninvolved vehicle and could have had problem with the steering mechanism of the vehicle. She stated it was supposed to have been fixed weeks before, but they were still having problems with the steering. There were belted 3 adult male passengers who were treated at the scene. The interviewee was transported to an area hospital, treated and released. Another belted female passenger was also transported to an area hospital treated an released.

It should be noted at this time, the researcher found a teddy bear, on the median of the four-lane highway, approximately 15 meters prior to the van going off road to the left. The researcher spoke to a 3-year-old child, from the van, and this child stated she dropped her teddy out the window and screamed before the crash. This caused the driver to be distracted from completing the passing of the uninvolved vehicle.
