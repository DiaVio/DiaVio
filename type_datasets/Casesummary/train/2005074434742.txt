This two-vehicle collision occurred early morning on a four-way traffic signal controlled intersection with a posted speed of 56 kph (35 mph). The two-way, undivided, five-lane roadway was dark, but lit, concrete, straight, and wet from melting morning frost. Pre-crash roadway for both vehicles has a 5% slope, but collision occurred on the crest portion of roadway.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Nissan 200SX coupe driven by a 23 year old male, was traveling south in lane one with the intention of going straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Nissan Sentra sedan driven by a 19 year-old male, was traveling north in lane three with the intention of turning left. As V 1 approached intersection, a semi-trailer was turning left in front of V1 path and had just cleared V1's travel lane. V1 adjusted his speed to allow semi to get through intersection. Unfortunately, from behind semi-trailer, V2 was also turning left. V1 never saw this vehicle due to the sight restriction created by the semi. V1's left front contacted the front of V2. V2's driver attention was on the turning semi and not much else. After impact, V1 came to final rest at southwest corner of intersection. V2 was rotated counterclockwise and traveled south on west side of roadway were it came to final rest against a street sign located on the sidewalk. Both vehicles were towed due to damage, the driver of V2 was transported to a local medical facility. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
