This single vehicle rollover event occurred on a four-lane divided asphalt-constructed road. This road runs north to south and has a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred just past noon during daylight hours with light traffic conditions and no adverse weather.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe, was southbound just under the speed limit and pulling a tent trailer. As V1 was going in the #1 travel lane, the right rear tire tread separated from the tire and caused V1 to steer left across the #2 lane. The driver reacted and steered right to counter the vehicle pull and this action caused the trailer to whip clockwise causing V1 to rotate clockwise and off the roadway into the center median. As V1 exited the road edge rotating clockwise the left side tires tripped on the dirt median and V1 rolled left 2 quarter turns coming to rest in the median on its roof. The thirty three (33) year-old male driver and 3 occupants were not injured. The driver stated that this event happened so fast that he didn't have time to control the vehicle. He stated his speed to be 97 kmph (60 mph) just prior to the tire tread coming off. V1 and the tent trailer were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.
