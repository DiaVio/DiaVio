The crash occurred on a fully controlled urban highway, divided by a grassy median with a metal guardrail, with a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65 mph). The highway consists of two bituminous one-way lanes in each direction. The crash occurred on the straight and level northbound lanes. Conditions at the time of the weekday afternoon crash were daylight and cloudy, and the roads were dry.
V1, a 1996 Ford Explorer 4 door, was northbound on the highway in lane two. A rock fell off of a truck and struck the windshield of a van (a non-contact vehicle) two vehicles in front of V1. The driver of the van and the vehicle behind it braked and came to a stop. The non-contact vehicle in front of V1 swerved onto the left shoulder. V1 swerved sharply to the right to avoid the van and began to rotate clockwise. V1 crossed into the right lane, and than departed the roadway to the right. The front right corner of V1 struck a delineator post on the side of the road. V1 continued rotating clockwise and rolled to the right down a 4% slope, digging into the grass with the front left corner, deploying the right front airbag. V1 rolled left 4-quarter turns, and came to rest facing northwest on its wheels, where the driver's airbag deployed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 23-year-old male on his way back to work after lunch at home. He stated he saw the vehicles brake suddenly in front of him so he braked and steered right. He was transported to a local trauma center due to injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
