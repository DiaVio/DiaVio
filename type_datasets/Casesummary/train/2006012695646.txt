V1, a 1998 Chevrolet Blazer four door with one occupant was traveling northbound in the left-turn lane. V2, a 1996 Pontiac Grand Am two door with one occupant was traveling southbound in lane one. The driver of V1 stated that he was going to turn down a side street and into the gas station. A car had just come out of nowhere and cut into the gas station. The driver was focused on this vehicle and did not see V2. V1 attempted to make the left turn. The driver of V2 stated that he did not see V1 until he began to turn because there was another vehicle ahead blocking his view, so he did not have time to attempt an avoidance action. The front of V2 contacted the right of V1 before they both came to final rest in the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
