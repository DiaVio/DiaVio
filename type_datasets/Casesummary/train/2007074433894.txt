This single vehicle crash occurred early morning during daylight hours on an interstate roadway. This two-way roadway is divided, with a jersey barrier with concrete travel lanes. It is level and has five travel lanes for eastbound traffic. The posted speed limit is 97 kmph (60 mph). This roadway was covered with mild frost at the time of collision.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan MPV Murano driven by a forty nine (49) year-old male driver, was traveling east in lane four with the intention of going straight. The driver lost control of V1 when a non-contact vehicle entering the interstate lost control in front and to the right of V1. V1's driver noticed the other vehicle fishtail several times and encroaching into his travel lane. V1's driver attempted to avoid a collision by steering left and braking, but the driver overreacted. As a result, V1 began to rotate counterclockwise, departed original travel lane to the left into lane five, and departed the left side of the roadway where it collided into the concrete median jersey barrier. V1's front bumper contacted the concrete jersey barrier and continued to spin counterclockwise. V1 then struck the barrier with right rear bumper, and returned onto roadway where it came to final rest diagonally across lanes five and four facing southeast. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
