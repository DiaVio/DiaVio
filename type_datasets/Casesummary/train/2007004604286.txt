The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane undivided north/south roadway. The roadway was bituminous and level, with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). It was afternoon on a weekday. The road was dry. Traffic flow southbound was at a standstill as a result of road closures elsewhere in the county due to forest fire activity. The traffic heading north was light.
V1, a 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix with two occupants, was traveling south and the driver became frustrated with the traffic. The driver then attempted an illegal U-turn, pulling out in front of V2, a 2000 Jeep Wrangler with one occupant, which had been traveling north. V2 struck V1 in the right rear quarter panel, spinning V1 clockwise approximately 180 degrees. V1 mounted the curb before coming to rest. Neither vehicle took any avoidance maneuver. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 70-year-old male who reported no injuries. V1 was also occupied by a 66-year-old female that reported a complaint of pain and was transported.

V1 crossed the double yellow centerline in front of V2, which was northbound. V2 struck V1 in the northbound lane. The driver of V1 refused an interview.
V2 was driven by a 45-year-old female who reported no injuries. The driver stated that she was traveling northbound when V1 suddenly turned in front of her. She took no avoidance maneuver.
