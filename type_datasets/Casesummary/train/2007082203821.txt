This single-vehicle daytime barrier collision occurred on a five-lane access controlled highway heading north. The roadway is straight, level and paved with concrete in the area of the crash. The roadway surface is paved with a round-stone aggregate concrete that is well worn and becomes slick during rain. The speed limit for the road is 97 kmph (60 mph). At the time of the crash it was raining heavily and the roadway was wet. On this day there were several areas of standing water on the highway, although it is unclear if there was standing water in the area of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Honda Accord sedan driven by a fifty four (54) year old female, was traveling north in lane four. V1 lost control for an unknown reason and spun counter-clockwise towards the center barrier on the left. The front of V1 struck the barrier with the majority of damage on the left half. V1 came to final rest facing north in lane four and was towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 refused to be interviewed for the study at a later date. The condition and inflation pressure of V1's tires is unknown. Besides driving too fast for conditions, the police report lists driver inattention as a contributing factor. The police report did not elaborate further about the inattention.
