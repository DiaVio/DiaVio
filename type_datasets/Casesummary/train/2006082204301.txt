This two vehicle daytime collision occurred at 1430 hours. The collision occurred southbound on a divided interstate highway, in lanes three and four of five travel lanes. The road is paved with concrete, and is straight and level in the area of the crash. The speed limit for the highway is 96 Kmph (60 mph).
Vehicle 1 (V 1), a 2001 Chevrolet Express van, driven by a 46 year-old male was headed south in lane four of five. Vehicle 2 (V 2), a 2001 Saturn LS1 sedan, driven by a 51 year-old male with one passenger was headed south in lane three of five with a passenger. V 1 changed lanes to the right, into the space that V 2 was occupying. The right side of V 1 pushed the left front corner of V 2. V 2 then veered right and spun clockwise towards a concrete traffic barrier off the right side of the road. The front of V 2 struck the concrete barrier, spun another quarter turn, and struck the barrier with the left rear corner. V 2 came to rest on the paved shoulder facing north, with the left rear corner resting against the traffic barrier. V-1 came to final rest on the east shoulder. The driver of V 2 was transported to a local medical facility. V 2 was towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V 1 stated that he had simply changed lanes to the right, and struck V 2. He stated that he had checked his mirror, and V 2 must have been in his blind spot or he wouldn't have changed lanes. V 2 was equipped with four studded winter tires, and the replacement of rubber contact with steel is a contributing factor in why V 2 lost control in such a dramatic fashion.
