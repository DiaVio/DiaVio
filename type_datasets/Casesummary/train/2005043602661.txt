This two-vehicle crash occurred in the intersection of a 4-way signalized intersection. The intersection, which historically had four stop signs for each direction, is now controlled by pre-timed traffic signals that were installed only 12 months earlier. At the location of this crash, all four directions were 2-lane undivided roads with an additional left-turn lane at the intersection. The conditions were a rainstorm, dark without street lamps, and early in the evening of a Monday.
V1, a 2005 Honda CR-V, was traveling south in lane 2 approaching the intersection. V2, a 2005 Toyota Tacoma, was traveling north in lane 1 toward the same intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection and V1 made a left turn and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1. Two children in V1 were transported to a hospital for injuries suffered in the crash but neither vehicle was towed due to disabling damage per PAR coding. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
