This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon in the westbound lanes of an eight-lane divided highway. The east/west highway consisted of four lane in each direction divided by a concrete barrier wall. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight and level with a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50 mph). This was a fully controlled highway and there were no traffic control devices. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2004 Volvo tractor with a trailer attached, was westbound in lane three. V2, a 2000 Porsche Boxster was westbound in lane four. As V2 attempted to pass V1 and change lanes into lane three the driver lost control and V2 began rotating clockwise. V2 rotated 180 degrees into lane three where it was struck by V1 head-on. After the impact, V2 rotated counter-clockwise and came to final rest in lane four facing west. V2 was towed due to disabling damages. After the impact, V1 came to a controlled stop in its original travel lane. V1 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V1's driver, a 45-year-old male, stated he was traveling westbound at approximately 89 kmph (50 mph) when he observed V2 swerving in and out of lanes three and four. He saw V2 lose control of his vehicle and entered his lane (lane three) rotating clockwise. He said he applied his brakes but could not stop in time.
The driver of V2, a 65-year old male, said he was traveling westbound in lane four at approximately 129 kmph (80 mph) attempting merge into lane three but the traffic flow would not allow him. He was frustrated with how slow the traffic was moving so he accelerated while steering right which he said caused him to lose control of his vehicle. His vehicle rotated and slid into lane three coming to a stop facing the oncoming traffic. He saw the truck coming towards him but it was too late there was nothing he could do. He was injured and transported to the hospital.
