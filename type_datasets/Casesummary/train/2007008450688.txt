This crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. There were two lanes, one westbound and one eastbound. This was a level, bituminous roadway with a slight right hand curve. It was early evening on a weekend and the road was slushy from recent snow and just above freezing temperatures. Traffic flow was congested and moving slowly due to poor road conditions.
V1, a 2001 Dodge Intrepid sedan with two occupants, was traveling east. V2, a 2005 Nissan Maxima sedan with one occupant, was traveling west. V1 lost control and spun counterclockwise into the westbound lane. The front of V2 struck the rear of V1 in the westbound lane. The impact pushed V1 westbound where it struck a curb and than a guardrail with its front end. Both units came to rest in the westbound lane and were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 64-year-old male, was transported along with his 59-year-old female passenger for treatment of incapacitating injuries. He said he just lost control of his vehicle on the ice and slush covered roadway. He claimed to do all he could but could not regain control of his vehicle.
The driver of V2, a 22-year-old female, was also transported from the scene with incapacitating injuries. She stated that she did not notice the V1 until it was right in front of her. She braked but could not avoid the collision.
