V1, a 2000 Plymouth Voyager minivan, was traveling westbound on a 2-lane undivided gravel/slag rural roadway. The roadway was dry, straight and level, and was bordered by a 40 cm deep ditch on its south side. There was no posted speed limit on the roadway, which by default in this State was 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours on a clear day. There was a minimum of loose gravel on this portion of the roadway.
The driver of V1, a 25-year old female, drifted into the oncoming lane for an unknown reason. Once she realized she had done this, she steered hard to the right, driving her vehicle into the ditch on the side of the road. She then attempted to re-enter the roadway by steering left. As V1 began to re-enter the roadway, it rolled over to its right, striking a mailbox in the process. The van rolled over 4 quarter-turns, coming to final rest on its wheels, facing northwest. The driver and her two juvenile passengers were transported, treated, and released. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
