This single vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours with clear weather and dry pavement when the driver drifted to the right of the travel lane, departed the roadway and the front of V1 collided with a wooden utility pole. V1 continued forward and the front contacted a street sign. V1, a 1989 Ford Econoline Cargo van occupied only by the unrestrained 18-year-old female driver, was traveling east on a bituminous, +3 slope, two-lane, two-way undivided roadway. Driver has no recollection as to the events that led to the collision. The last thing driver remembers was stopping at a four way intersection, approximately 100 meters prior to the collision area, and proceeding forward. No reliable person witnessed the collision, although two were listed on the police report. The posted speed limit on this roadway is 48 kmph (30 mph). The driver was transported with complaint of injury; V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was not equipped with any airbag.
