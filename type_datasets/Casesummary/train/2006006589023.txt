The driver of V2, a 27-year old female, is familiar with the roadway. It's a work route and she travels it daily. She said she was traveling north in lane one. She said, as she approached the intersection she looked both ways because she knows it's a busy intersection and cars speed up and down the road. She was absolutely positive the light was green and that the other driver ran the red light. She thought he was going to stop for a minute, he looked at her and hesitated and then took off. After he hit her car, her car spun around and hit a car parked on the right hand side of the street. She said the car behind hers continued traveling through the intersection as well and it's a wonder he didn't hit their vehicle too. She was transported to the hospital with minor injuries
