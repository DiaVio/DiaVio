The crash occurred on a secondary arterial road that ran east/west, had two lanes with one in each direction and was divided by a double yellow stripe. The road was straight and level with a speed limit of 72kph (45mph). The area of the crash was rural/residential. A shallow drainage ditch that ran parallel to the road between intermittent driveways and utility poles bordered the north side of the road. There was also a church parking lot on the south side of the roadway about 65meters east of the impact area. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry in the early afternoon on a weekend.
V1 was a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder traveling west on the road when as it passed the church lot the driver reached for his seatbelt (due to an apparent speed trap/police cruiser located in the lot) causing V1 to depart the right (north) side of the road. Its undercarriage impacted the edge of an intersecting driveway as V1 crossed it and then impacted a utility pole with its front coming to rest at the pole facing west. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by an unrestrained thirty one year old male who had an unrestrained twenty eight year old female passenger in the right front position. Both occupants' airbags deployed and both were transported to an area trauma center for treatment of incapacitating injuries. They were on their way to get lunch at the time of the crash.
