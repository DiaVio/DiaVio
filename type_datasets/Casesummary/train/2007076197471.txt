This two-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area with various curves and elevations on a 4-lane divided asphalt roadway with an extended median. The southbound lanes curve right and are downhill. The speed limit is 89 kmph (55 mph) with an advisory speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) for the curve and downhill elevation. The crash occurred mid-afternoon during daylight. The roadway was wet and it was raining at the time of the crash. A previous crash was blocking traffic and there was considerable congestion.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet Suburban with a utility trailer of 3.7 meters (12 feet) of length in tow, was southbound in the #1 lane negotiating the right curve when it came upon vehicle two (V2) that was stopped in the #1 lane due to a prior crash which was not cleared yet. The driver of V1 steered left and braked impacting the guardrail on the left side of the roadway. The trailer contacted the back end plane of V2, a 2005 Dodge Caravan, pushing it into the dirt embankment on the right side of the roadway. After impacting the embankment with its right front end, V2 rotated clockwise where it tripped, and flipped onto its left side plane coming to rest off the right side of the road. After contacting the guardrail, V1 crossed both lanes to the right and contacted the dirt embankment with its right front end and came to rest facing south. V1 was driven from the scene. V2 was towed due to damage. Neither driver was able to be contacted for interviews. Following the crash V1 was driven out of the study area and was not inspected. It is unknown if there were any vehicle condition factors for V1. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
