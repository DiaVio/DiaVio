This crash occurred on a high occupancy, high volume, and high-speed interstate. There were five lanes running southbound with emergency paved shoulders on both the right and left sides. The conditions were dry and clear on a weekend night. The posted speed was 105 kmph (65 mph). There were two raised concrete median traffic barriers separating the north and south roadways.
V1, a 2003 Honda Civic with one occupant, was southbound in lane five. It was noted by witnesses that V1 was traveling at a very high rate of speed. As V1 weaved in and out of traffic it lost control and drove up on the left side concrete barrier wall. V1 took out about 15m (50 ft) of plastic separators causing debris to fly into the northbound lanes of traffic. V1 then rolled right 10 quarter-turns and skidded to final rest in lane three. V1 was towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is 177 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 16-year-old male, was racing his friend (who also had a Honda) to see which car could go faster. He stated that he was going about 110 mph when he lost control and departed the roadway off the left side. He hit the brakes but could not control the vehicle. He then stated that his car drove up the concrete median taking out the middle plastic dividers. His vehicle than began to roll for what felt like forever. There were sparks and he finally landed upside sown in the middle lane facing oncoming traffic. He said his friend that he was racing stopped to see if he was ok but left before the cops got there so they would not get into trouble. He was cited for reckless driving. A witness also stopped who stated that he was going a high rate of speed as he weaved in and out of traffic racing another vehicle until he crashed into the left wall. The driver was transported for treatment of non-incapacitating injuries.
