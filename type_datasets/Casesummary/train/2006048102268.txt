V1 contained two occupants. The driver was a 39 year-old female and the passenger a 37 year-old female. The driver had left her sisters' house a short time ago and they were commuting to work and having a social conversation. The driver advised that as she went through the curve the vehicle started skidding to the right. The driver locked the brakes and steered left in an attempt to regain control of the vehicle. She also advised that she was not familiar with the vehicle and rarely drives the roadway. According to her and the investigating officer she was negotiating the curve at a safe speed, which was less than the posted speed limit. She was unaware the vehicles tires were bald since it was not her vehicle and she had only driven it two or three times in the past month.
