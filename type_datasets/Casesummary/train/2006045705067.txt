This crash occurred in a residential neighborhood on a straight two-lane, two-way road that had no painted dividers or physical dividers. The road ran east/west with a grade negative 5.1% at impact (if westbound). The road was bordered on the north by a sidewalk and several private driveways. The speed limit was 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash occurred in the early evening under daylight and dry conditions.
V1, a 1990 Ford Tempo with two occupants, was westbound on the road when it departed the left roadside and struck V2, a 1995 Chevrolet Tahoe (struck in the front) that was parked on the sidewalk in front of a house. V2 was not a case vehicle as it was not in transport. V1 came to rest at impact facing west and was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 44 year-old belted male, was listed as sustaining minor injuries in the crash. He was transported from the scene via EMS but this was more due to the fact that the driver had had a seizure, which caused the loss of control. The driver was taking his stepson to work (he was transported with possible injuries also) and did not remember much about the events leading to the crash other than smoking a cigarette at the time of the crash.
