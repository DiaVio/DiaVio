The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes and shoulder of an interstate highway that ran east/west and was divided by a concrete barrier wall. There were four eastbound lanes with paved shoulders on either side. South of the right eastbound shoulder was a drainage ditch with a side slope measuring -17.4%. The interstate was straight with a negligible negative grade of 0.4%. The speed limit was 89kph/55mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry with cloud cover in the early afternoon on a weekday.
V1 was a 1996 Honda Accord traveling east in lane 2 of the interstate. It departed the right side of the road and went into a counterclockwise yaw in the grass of the drainage ditch and tripped, rolling to its right 4 quarter turns coming to rest on its wheels facing north. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a seventeen-year-old, unrestrained female who was ejected through the drivers' window during the roll event. She was transported to a local trauma center for treatment of incapacitating injuries. The driver did state in the interview that she was emotionally troubled over going to meet with her ex-boyfriend (this trip) and had been suffering from a migraine headache since getting up in the morning. She then expounded and stated that her chest had begun to tighten and as she reached for her asthma inhaler in her purse on the right front seat she blacked out.
