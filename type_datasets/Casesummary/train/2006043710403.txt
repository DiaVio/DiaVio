This single-vehicle crash occurred in pre-dawn hours of a weekday off the right side of a roadway just beyond a four-way, signal controlled intersection. Southbound approach was level, right curve with a 2% super-elevation. There were three southbound lanes and two northbound lanes with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The east/west roadway was consisted of three lanes divided by a grass median (one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes). The traffic flow was normal, but roadway was wet from a previous rainfall and dark due to a lack of streetlights at the time of the crash.
Vehicle One (V1), a 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4x4 four door with four occupants, was southbound in lane three approaching the intersection where it intended to turn left. As V1 turned left into a neighborhood, it failed to stay in its lane and departed the roadway off the right side. V1 steered hard left returning to the roadway but struck the median curb with its left rear tire. V1 then steered right, over-correcting and inducing a clockwise rotation. V1 departed the road again to the right as its left tires struck the south curb. V1 subsequently rolled one-quarter turn before coming to final rest on its left side along the tree line facing west roughly 6 meters (20 feet) south of rollover trip initiation. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 20 year-old female, was transported from the scene with minor injuries. She reports leaving home that morning traveling to her sister's house to pick up her two nieces to take them to day care. She stated she was in the left turn lane with a green light. As she turned, she hit the right curb causing her to steer left hard. She then hit the center median with the left rear tire, causing her to jerk the wheel right. She overcorrected, and began skidding she struck the curb and overturned.
