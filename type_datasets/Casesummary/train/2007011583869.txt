The single vehicle, weekday, early afternoon crash occurred off the right side of a northbound, bituminous, straight, level, 2-lane collector which led to a 4-lane interstate roadway. The collector was fed by a level, bituminous, 1 lane right-curving exit from another interstate roadway. At the time of the crash it was daylight, cloudy and the roadway was wet from a recent rain. The roadway had a non-posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70mph).
V1, a 2007 Pontiac G6 4-door sedan solely occupied by a 27 year-old female driver, was on the exit ramp, going from west to north, approaching the collector described above. As V1 was negotiating the curving ramp to the right the vehicle began to rotate clockwise. The driver steered left and the vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise just as the vehicle entered lane 1 of the collector. The driver steered right, applied the brakes, and the vehicle went into a clockwise yaw. V1 skidded off the right side of the road onto the shoulder; left side leading, and struck the end of a steel guardrail with its left rear side. V1 then rotated counterclockwise, slid down an embankment and came to rest facing north-northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that she was going to work and was moving along with traffic taking the exit ramp to the collector. She said she was late for work but was not in a hurry and was traveling approximately 40 mph. The driver said the car started to fishtail so she steered left and right but the car slid off the road to the right and hit a guardrail. She said the car then spun to the left and landed in a ditch. She also reported that the roadway was wet at the time of the crash. The roadway was damp when the researcher arrived and almost dry when the police arrived.
