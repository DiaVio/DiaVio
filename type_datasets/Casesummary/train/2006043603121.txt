This single-vehicle crash happened on a clear, dry, weeknight on a dark roadway without lights. The roadway is curved to the right, has a downhill slope and a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).
V1, a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4, was traveling south on a 4-lane undivided roadway when it departed the left side of the road and drove into a creek. The driver and her right front passenger were treated and released from a local hospital. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 31-year-old female that suffers from panic attacks, seizures, and migraine headaches. She has experienced two seizures the past two years and reportedly had a continuous headache throughout this day. She also reports to be stressed from an ongoing divorce and yesterday she turned over property rights to her husband. She is currently on a long-term medical disability from her job and has not worked in six months.
For this trip tonight, she was driving her daughter home when she blacked-out and drove off the road. She only remembers leaving a Taco Bell and singing a song with her daughter. She does not remember driving off the roadway until her daughter woke her up as they were headed toward a creek. She said she was in shock and did not try to stop her vehicle. She drove straight into a creek, where it came to final rest. Both she and her daughter were able to exit the Jeep and call EMS for help. She suffered a minor concussion and some soreness across the chest from her seat belt while her daughter only received a bruised left knee. This driver reports to be in fair health, is near-sighted and takes three different medications for seizures and anxiety.
