This single-vehicle collision occurred during night hours on a weeknight. The crash scene has no artificial lighting. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a two-lane, two-way, east-west, bituminous roadway. The speed limit on this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). A narrow unpaved shoulder borders the south road edge; the north road edge has no shoulder, and a steep downhill embankment slopes into the tree line. At the time of the crash, there was snow along the roadsides, but the roadway itself was dry and free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1988 Ford Bronco II compact SUV, was traveling westbound in the first lane. An animal ran into the road. V1 veered right to avoid the animal and departed the road to the right side. V1 rotated counter-clockwise on the steep embankment and the right side of V1 struck two trees, bringing V1 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.
