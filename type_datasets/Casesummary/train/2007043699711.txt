The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a divided, two-lane highway. There was a left breakdown lane, a center through lane, and a right merge lane. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph) and a 1% uphill grade. Conditions were dark and dry with clear skies. The setting was early evening hours on a weekend.
Vehicle one was a 2000 Toyota MR2 traveling westbound in lane one. This vehicle lost control and traveled off the right side of the roadway. It returned to the road, crossing over all lanes before impacting the median wall with its front. It then rolled two complete turns, coming to rest on its wheels in the breakdown lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The Toyota MR2 (v1) was driven by a 51-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with evident injuries. She stated that she was heading to a restaurant with her husband. She had just rounded the turn of an exit ramp when she noticed a large cardboard box in her lane. She steered left and then blacked out the events of the crash. She estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 72 kmph (45 mph). Her Toyota convertible was towed due to damage.
