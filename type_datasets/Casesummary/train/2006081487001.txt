A single-vehicle collision occurred a few hours before mid-night on a rural two-way, two-lane undivided roadway. The pre-crash bituminous roadway is a 10% downhill grade. The roadway is straight approaching a sharp left 90-degree turn. It was raining and the roadway was wet. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 40 Kmph (25mph). An arrow in the curve indicated the turn in the roadway.
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 1995 Ford Explorer with three occupants, was traveling southbound in lane one. V1 was approaching a 90-degree left curve when the driver noticed the sign, he braked and the vehicle departed the roadway via the right shoulder, went airborne and impacted the front into the ground, and the vehicle flipped end over end, and landed on its roof. V1 was towed due to damage. None of the three occupants were transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 is a 19 year-old male, who was reportedly in good health, with no hearing or vision restrictions, his sleep, work, and attention factors are unknown as the interview was done through one of the occupants. The driver is familiar with his vehicle, however he had rarely been on the road and was unfamiliar with the roadway. Tests revealed a blood/alcohol concentration of 0.114. The weather was a factor as it was raining hard that night.
