The crash occurred at a four-way intersection. The east/west roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street, controlled by a stop sign. The north/south roadway was also a two-way, two-lane undivided street. There were no traffic controls for north/south traffic. These were straight, level, asphalt roads, with posted speeds of 40 kmph (25 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday evening, with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1999 Chevy Cavalier with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V2, a 1997 Toyota T-100 pickup with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V1 made contact with the left side of V2. This impact was followed immediately by a sideslip impact between the right side of V1 and the left side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
V1, the Chevy Cavalier, was driven by a 47-year old female, who was not injured. She stated that she was on her way from the bank to her office. She was in a very unfamiliar area, one in which she had never been before. She knew where she wanted to go, but did not know which street she needed to turn on. The driver indicated that she was trying to look at street signs as she drove. She said she didn't see the stop sign because it was leaning over to one side.
V2, the Toyota T-100, was driven by a 31-year old male, who was transported to the hospital with possible injuries. He stated that he was on his way from the store to his shop. This is a route that the driver takes on a daily basis, and he was very familiar with the roadway. He said that he didn't have a stop sign, so he proceeded through the intersection. Upon doing so, the driver was hit. He believed the other driver was going very fast, due to the damage he observed to her vehicle after the crash.
