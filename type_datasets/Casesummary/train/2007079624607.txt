This single vehicle mid-morning collision occurred on an eastbound Interstate highway. The two-lane highway is one-way, dry, level, concrete, and curves left. Both the north edge and the south edge of the highway is bordered by painted asphalt shoulders. Tunnel walls surround the highway lanes. Approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) west of the collision, the eastbound lanes of the interstate highway separate from the westbound lanes. The two eastbound lanes enter two tunnels that divert it under several overpasses. The collision occurred in one of these dark, but lighted tunnels. The interstate is designated a 104 kmph (65 mph) zone.
Vehicle one (V1) is a 1994 Toyota Camry station wagon, driven by a thirty five (35) year old female with three passengers. V1 was traveling eastbound in the number two lane. As V1 was traveling through the tunnel, the driver encountered a slower vehicle in her lane. The driver attempted to change lanes to the right. The driver lost control as she partially changed to the number one lane. V1 traveled across the number two lane and towards the north shoulder. The front plane of V1 contacted the concrete tunnel wall, located north of the north shoulder. The left plane of V1 then contacted the tunnel wall as it traveled towards final rest. V1 came to rest facing eastbound blocking the northern shoulder and lane number two. V1 received major damage and was towed. However, the vehicle was driven to the right shoulder prior to being towed. The vehicle suffered an engine fire while it was being towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
