The crash occurred on a southbound stretch of interstate highway that was level and had a curve to the left with a radius measuring 3758m and a super-elevation of three percent. There were three southbound lanes separated from the northbound lanes by a grass median. Both southbound shoulders were paved with rumble strips. The right roadside had a negative grade side-slope measuring 16.3 percent. The right roadside was lined with light poles, and just a few meters southwest of the light poles there was a drainage ditch that ran parallel to the roadway. Conditions at the time of the crash were dark (but illuminated) with moderate rainfall close to midnight on a weekday. The speed limit was 89kmph/55mph.
V1 was a 2001 BMW Z3 convertible that was traveling south in lane one when it drove through some water, went into a counterclockwise yaw and departed the right side of the road where it struck a light pole with its right side. V1 then rotated in the opposite direction, (direction of rotation was changed by event 1 as the impact point on V1's right was just a bit forward of the rear wheels) clockwise, and impacted the drainage ditch with its undercarriage, coming to rest facing northwest with the right rear wheel still in the drainage ditch. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a forty-one-year-old female whose airbags did not deploy. She was uninjured in the crash. She reported that she was traveling home from out of state to another state and had been on the road overall for almost four hours. She said she had stopped ten minutes previous at a fast food restaurant drive-thru to eat as she had begun to feel a little shaky due to a "mild form of diabetes" that was untreated at the time of the crash. She said she ate in the car in the restaurant parking lot and continued on her way. She stated that as she was driving in lane one she "hit some water" and began to "spin out" while steering left and braking.
