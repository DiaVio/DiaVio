This two vehicle crash occurred mid-afternoon at the intersection of a five lane roadway and a two lane roadway. The east/west, two lane roadway, is straight and level asphalt and controlled by stop signs. The north/south roadway is straight and level with no traffic controls. The posted speed limit for the five lane, north/south roadway, is 56 kmph (35 mph). The posted speed limit for the two lane roadway is 40 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Ranger pickup driven by a 59 year-old male with one passenger was westbound in the number one lane of the two-lane roadway and stopped at the stop and then proceeded into the intersection. V1 was loaded with about 136 kilograms (300 pounds) of cargo secured in the pickup bed. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue sedan driven by a 92 year-old male was northbound in the number two lane of the northbound roadway traveling at 56 kmph (35 mph). V1 saw the approaching V2 and misjudged the speed and distance. He also assumed the other driver would yield to him. V2 struck the left side of V1. V1 rotated right and came to rest within the center of the intersection facing northwest at final rest. V2 veered to the left and traveled over a curb on the west edge and continued into a block and steel fence. V2 then continued forward and struck V3, a properly parked and driverless vehicle on a used car lot. A secondary side-slap impact occurred between V1 and V2 as they separated. V1 came to final rest in the intersection facing northwest. V2 came to final rest off the roadway to the northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
