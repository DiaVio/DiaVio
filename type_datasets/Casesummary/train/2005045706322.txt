The crash occurred on a one-way single lane entrance ramp to an interstate. It had a positive grade of 4% with a curve right. There was also an exit ramp that approached from the left side of the on ramp traffic. The crash occurred in the mid morning hours on a weekday at the end of rush hour. The posted speed limit on the on-ramp was 48 KPH / 30 MPH. Conditions were daylight and dry.
Vehicle 1 was a 2001 Mitsubishi Galant traveling westbound up the on-ramp following behind Vehicle 2, a 2003 Dodge 1500 Pickup. A non-contact vehicle came across the median from the eastbound off-ramp to the eastbound on-ramp crossing in front of another non-contact vehicle that was traveling in front of Vehicle 2. This caused both V2 and the vehicle in front of him to brake suddenly. Subsequently, V1 did not stop, and rear-ended V2, with Vehicle 1 coming to rest on the right shoulder of the ramp, as did V2. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene with minor bumper damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
