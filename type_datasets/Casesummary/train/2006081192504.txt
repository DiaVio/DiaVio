The NASS researcher interviewed a witness, however, they provided very little information about the crash. The on-scene images of the vehicle indicate the vehicle was traveling at a fairly high rate of speed based on the damage to its front plane. The vehicle could not be located after it was removed from the scene for a more detailed inspection.
