The crash occurred on a north/south arterial road that had six lanes in the area of the crash (three in each direction) that were divided by a concrete median that was curb height. There was a crossover cut through the median to give traffic access to local businesses. The road was straight and level with a speed limit of 72kmph/45mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry around mid morning during rush hour (no congestion) on a weekday.
V1 was a 1998 Kia Sportage 4x4 that was turning left from lane three southbound through the crossover intending to enter a private business lot. V1 was hit on the right side while crossing northbound lane 1 by the front of V2, a 2002 Ford Escape. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and traveled north onto a grass area in front of a business and hit an out of service fire hydrant coming to rest facing north. V2 rotated clockwise about 90 degrees and came to rest facing east in the business driveway. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a thirty-four year old female who was transported to an area hospital by family later that day for possible injuries. She was stopping at the store for coffee on her way to work when the crash occurred. Her spouse told the researcher that there was a pickup in the crossover blocking her view of northbound traffic but she went anyway.
V2 was driven by a twenty-nine year old female who was not transported although she was listed on the police report as sustaining possible injuries. She was on her way to work at the time of the crash. She told her spouse that she did not see the other vehicle until it came out from behind a pickup that was stopped in the crossover and by then it was too late.
