The crash occurred at an intersection in the westbound lane of a two-way, rural roadway. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and a downhill grade of 3% approaching the intersection in the westbound direction. Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies. The setting was morning hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 1996 Suzuki X-90 compact sport utility traveling westbound in lane one, approaching the intersection. V1 crossed over the intersection and departed the right side of the roadway. V1 then contacted a wooden fence post with its front plane. V1 continued into a medium-sized tree with its front plane. V1 came to final rest against the tree in the northwest roadside of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 31-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries. The driver refused to be interviewed despite having received two official letters regarding the NMVCCS study. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 72 kmp (45 mph). The compact sport utility was towed due to damage.
