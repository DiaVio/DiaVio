This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway, which are both designated 56 kmph (35 mph) zones. The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal without a protected left turn phase. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Nissan extended cab pickup, was traveling eastbound in the fourth lane of a seven-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. V1 was stopped in the middle of the intersection and awaiting an opportunity to turn left into northbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Dodge Durango, was traveling westbound in the third lane of opposing traffic, approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V1 made its turn, the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V1 spun counter-clockwise and came to rest facing west in the westbound lanes. V2 deflected right and departed the road over the northwest corner, where the front of V1 impacted a steel traffic signal pole, bringing V2 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
