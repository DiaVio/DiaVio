V1 drifted left and exited the road to the left. V1, front, struck a tree >10cm. The driver of V1 was transported. V1 was towed due to damage.
The elderly driver was diagnosed with a heart condition a few years prior to the crash. On the morning of the crash, he had played 18 holes of golf (which had taken approximately 4 Â½ hours using a power cart). By the time he finished, the temperature was approaching 90 degrees. This was less than an hour before the crash. It was determined later at the hospital that his fatigue coupled with the heat had combined to cause heart failure, which caused him to lose consciousness just before the crash.
