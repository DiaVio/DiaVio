The crash occurred in the intersection of a north-south bound three-lane roadway with an east-west bound business driveway. The roadway had two northbound lanes (lane one was marked as right turn only) and one southbound lane. Both the roadway and the driveway were straight, dry, level, asphalt. The crash occurred early on a weekday afternoon under clear skies while traffic was moderate. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, a 1996 Buick Century four-door with one occupant was traveling west on the driveway. V2, a 2006 Ford Taurus four-door with one occupant was northbound in lane two. After stopping, V1 started to turn left toward the southbound lane one. It traveled across the path of V2, which was going straight. Neither vehicle took any avoidance measures. The front right of V2 struck the left front of V1 causing it to rotate counter-clockwise. V1 came to rest facing west about two meters north of the impact point. V2 continued traveling north about three meters and came to rest facing north. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage.
