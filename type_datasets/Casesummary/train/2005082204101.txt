This single vehicle nighttime crash occurred a few hours before midnight on a one-way street with three southbound lanes, just past a 4-way traffic signal controlled intersection. The pre-crash roadway is bituminous, was dry at the time of the crash, has a 6% downhill grade, and curves right approaching the intersection, and then jogs left after the intersection. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). At the time of the crash, it was clear but the roadway was wet. The roadway was illuminated by street lights, and there were no sight restrictions or road defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a white 1986 Nissan pickup driven by an unknown age male and male passenger, was traveling south on the one-way roadway in lane two approaching the intersection. After passing through the intersection the number one lane becomes a parking lane during certain posted hours. The driver of V1 passed through the intersection in lane 2 and about 19 meters (62 feet) later, braked with lockup in the left curve and departed the road to the right. V1's front impacted with a traffic sign and a tree. V1 came to final rest at that approximate point of impact against the tree. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Both V1 occupants left the scene before EMS or the police arrived and all information about both V1 occupants is unknown. A witness, who was traveling in the opposite direction, stated that V1 had passed through the intersection at a high rate of speed, skidded, and then impacted the tree. The occupants were described as white males in their thirties. The vehicle had been reported stolen and the vehicle had been involved in an earlier shoplift in which a quantity of beer was stolen.
Associative Factors: Scene evidence and witness' indicates that the V1 driver was speeding.
