The driver is familiar with the vehicle and was the first time he had driven the route. V1 driver claimed stopping 3-4 seconds, looking left and right before going through intersection. Before V1 cleared the intersection it was struck in the left rear by vehicle two (V2). Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1997 Dodge Stratus occupied only by the 38-year-old female driver, was traveling north in lane one of a two-way, two-lane, level, straight, and bituminous roadway. Speed limit for V2 was 48 kmph (30 mph) and had no traffic light or stop sign. V2 approached the intersection with the intention of going straight.

As a result, V2 did not perform any avoidance maneuvers and struck the left rear of V1 with the front bumper. V2 continued across the intersection before coming to final rest facing north in the curb lane. V1 spun counterclockwise after impact and came to final rest at the west side of intersection facing east. V1 was driven from the scene.
