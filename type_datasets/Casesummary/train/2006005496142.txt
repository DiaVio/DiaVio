The crash occurred on an undivided east/west roadway that had one lane in each direction plus a left-turn only lane in the eastbound direction. This was a straight, level bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was early evening on a weekday (still daylight) and the roadway was dry and the skies were clear. The traffic flow was congested, with stop-and-go activity.
Vehicle one (V1), 1999 Pontiac Bonneville four-door sedan with one occupant, was traveling eastbound, approaching an intersection with a driveway of a fast food establishment. Vehicle two (V2), a Volkswagen Jetta four-door sedan with two occupants, was traveling westbound approaching the same intersection. V1 pulled into the left turn-only lane and stopped, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear so that the driver could make a left turn. A non-contact minivan driver stopped in the opposing lane waved the driver of V1 on to make the left turn. V1 cleared the front of the minivan and was entering the driveway when the right rear of V1 was struck by the front right of V2. The driver of V2 had passed stopped non-contact vehicles in his lane on the right in order to continue on. After impact, V1 rotated slightly clockwise before coming to an uncontrolled final rest facing north, partially blocking the roadway and driveway. V2 came to an uncontrolled final rest in the westbound lane facing westbound. V1 was towed from the scene due to crash damage. V2 was drivable and was driven from the scene by driver #2. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
