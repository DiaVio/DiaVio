This single-vehicle crash occurred on a rural highway with no controls. North of the crash site, the roadway is undivided with four traffic lanes, two through lanes each for the northbound and southbound directions. This roadway is curved to the east (left) and downhill in the southbound direction, with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This crash occurred at night in the mid-evening hours with light traffic flow; the roadway was dark.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan Armada with three occupants, was traveling southbound in lane one, negotiating the left curve. An elk crossed the roadway shortly after the curve and the driver of V1 applied the brakes to avoid contact with the animal. The driver told police he was unable to swerve to miss it because of oncoming traffic and the front of V1 collided with the elk. After the impact, the driver of V1 was able to bring the vehicle to a controlled stop on the paved right shoulder. V1 was towed due to damage. None of the occupants was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a sixty-eight-year-old male, was driving from a nearby gambling town to his home. He was well rested, very comfortable with his vehicle, and drives this route about once every two months. He is in good health and takes no medications.
