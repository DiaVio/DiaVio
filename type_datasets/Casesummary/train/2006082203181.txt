This two vehicle rear-end type early evening crash occurred in lane one of a controlled-access highway. The road has a speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) and consists of three northbound, straight, level, bituminous, lanes that are separated from southbound lanes by a reinforced concrete jersey barrier. At the time of the crash it was daylight, cloudy, and there were no road defects or sight restrictions.
Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Mazda 6 with two occupants, was northbound in lane one. V2 had stopped behind a transit bus that had stopped in lane one at a bus stop. Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Buick Skylark sedan with four occupants, was northbound in lane one behind a large pickup truck and approaching V2. The large pickup, a non-collision vehicle, changed lanes and overtook the stopped bus. V1 then noticed that V2 was stopped, but was unable to stop before the front of V1 impacted the rear of V2. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. The two front occupants in V1 were treated at the scene. There were no other injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The V1 driver, an 18-year-old male, stated that he could not see the bus that was stopped because of the truck that was in front of him. When the truck changed lanes, and the V1 driver noticed V2 and the bus stopped in front of him, he slammed on his brakes and skidded into V2.
