This two-vehicle crash occurred at a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. The east/west roadway is straight and divided by a curbed median. The westbound approach lanes have an 8% uphill grade and consist of two through lanes and a left turn lane. The speed limit on this roadway is 64 kmph (40 mph). It was dusk with streetlights on at the time of the crash and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions although the roadway was wet due to earlier rain.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Pontiac Grand Am, was westbound in lane three (the left turn lane). Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Jeep Liberty, was westbound in lane one. V1 turned right at the intersection and the right side was struck by the front of V2. V1 rotated and the right side struck the left side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a seventeen-year-old male, was traveling with four male passengers. They were traveling from a restaurant to a friend's house for a party. No one in the vehicle knew the directions to the party and one of the passengers was on a cell phone getting directions. After directing the driver to turn left at the intersection, he suddenly shouted to him to turn right. The driver checked the mirror and did not see V2. This driver was healthy and well rested. He stated that he was familiar with his vehicle but was not comfortable with his passengers. He had only a provisional driver's license.
The driver of V2, a forty-six-year-old female, was traveling from her home to her daughter's home. She was well rested, healthy and familiar with her vehicle. She travels this route daily. This driver did not realize that V1 was turning right and did not have time to make any avoidance maneuvers.
