The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two lane undivided roadway. There was one westbound and one eastbound lane. This was a curvy level bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 KMPH (35 MPH). It was early afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and skies were clear. Traffic flow was light and moving freely.
V1, a 2002 Chevrolet Venture minivan with one occupant, was traveling east. V2, a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck with one occupant, was traveling west. V1 failed to negotiate a right hand curve and entered the eastbound lane. V2 moved over to the fog line to give V1 enough room but was struck on the left side. The resulting impact pushed V2 off the road and into a utility pole with its right side. V2 came to rest on the roadside under the pole. V1 came to rest 15 meters from impact in the westbound lane facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
V1, the Chevrolet Venture, was driven by a 55-year old male who was transported from the scene. No interview could be obtained for V1. Police reported that the driver stated that something flew into his eye causing him to lose sight of the road. The driver crossed the yellow lane line and struck V2.
V2, the Chevrolet pickup truck, was driven by a 56-year old male who reported a complaint of pain but was not transported due to injuries. The driver related he was unable to move over far enough to avoid being hit.
