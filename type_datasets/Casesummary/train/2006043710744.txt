An eye witness could confirm that this driver was stopped at the stop sign, then for an unapparent reason, he pulled out in front of V2. His vehicle suffered severe left side damage and was towed from the scene.
V2, the Ford F-150, was driven by a 24 year-old male who was transported from the scene with evident injuries. He is a part-time college student and works 20 hours per week landscaping. He reportedly just had dinner with his wife at Applebee's. She drove him back to his truck which was parked due to a dead battery. He changed the battery and pulled out, back onto the highway. A state trooper was directly behind him, and wife behind the state trooper. He was driving at 88 kph (55 mph) as he approached the intersection. He reported moderate traffic on the roadway. He noticed VI stopped at the stop sign with several vehicles behind him. All of a sudden, VI pulled out into traffic. The driver of V2 hit the brakes, locking them up, but didn't steer left or right, in fear of rolling his vehicle. He then collided with the left side of VI at 80 kph (50 mph). His vehicle was towed from the scene with severe front-end damage.
