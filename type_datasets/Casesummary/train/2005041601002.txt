The posted speed limit was 105 KPH (65 MPH). Conditions were evening on a weekday with wet roads and rainy skies.
Vehicle 1 was a 2001 Toyota Tundra pickup traveling northbound on the entrance ramp at approximately 89 KPH (55 MPH). This truck started to wobble and shake as the right rear tire's tread began to separate. V1's driver stated that he lost control and struck the left side concrete barrier wall. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 51-year-old male who was not injured. His car was towed due to disabling damage. The fact that it was raining and the wet roadway conditions were two associated factors considered in this crash.
