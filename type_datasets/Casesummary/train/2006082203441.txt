A three vehicle daytime collision occurred heading north on an urban one-way arterial street. The road consists of five lanes of one-way traffic paved with concrete and an uphill grade of +3%. At different times of the day lane five is a parking lane, while lane one is only for bus traffic. The speed limit for the road is 40 kmph (25 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear the road was wet.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Jaguar S-type sedan with only a driver, was leaving a parked position in lane five. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Lexus ES300 sedan with a driver and passenger, was heading north in lane four. Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Honda Civic sedan with only a driver, was headed north in lane two. V2 and V3 were slowing to a stop for a red light when V1 pulled from the parked position. The front left of V1 struck the left rear corner of V2 which caused V2 to rotate counter clockwise, out of the path of V1. V1 continued across the road and the front of V1 struck the left side of V3. V3 spun counter-clockwise and V1 continued forward, struck and mounted a curb before the front struck a pole where it came to rest facing east. The left front wheel of V1 caught on the curb and broke the steering knuckle, fully disabling V1. V1 and V3 were towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V3 was a 30-year-old male. He refused a complete interview, giving only a brief description of the collision. According to the driver of V3, he was slowing to a stop when V1 careened towards his driver's side, and then he spun around. He did not hear or see the first collision with V2, and did look directly at V1, but caught the motion out of the corner of his eye. The vehicle was not involved in the first harmful event and was not assigned a critical reason.
