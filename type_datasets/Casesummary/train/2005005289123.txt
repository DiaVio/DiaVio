This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, two-way, undivided roadway. There were no vehicle traffic control signals present for this particular stretch of roadway. The road had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). It had just started to rain slightly but the road was still considered dry at the time of the incident. The gradient for this trafficway was measured to be level.
Vehicle one (V1) and Vehicle two (V2) were both light vehicles. V1, a 2002 Honda Civic, was approaching V2, a 1980 Dodge Aspen, at approximately 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph), heading in the same direction. V2 was stopped on the roadway waiting to make a left turn into a private driveway. The left front of V1 made contact with the rear right of V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate counter-clockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to final rest in the entranceway of a daycare center. V1 continued forward before coming to final rest in its original lane of travel. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
