This is a two-vehicle crash that occurred shortly after noon during daylight hours on a four lane, two-way roadway. There are three westbound and three eastbound lanes and a left turn lane for each direction. There is a raised median to divide the roadway. This crash occurred at a four way intersection that is controlled by stop signs for traffic to enter the east/west bound roadway. The roadway is straight, level and constructed of bituminous asphalt. The speed limit for the roadway is posted 56 kmph (35 mph). The roadway was dry and the sky was clear.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Tacoma 4X2 pickup driven by a 18 year-old male, was making a left turn from the eastbound left turn lane to travel north. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chrysler Sebring sedan driven by a 70 year-old female was traveling westbound in the #2 lane at about 56 kmph (35 mph). There was a vehicle that was stopped in front of V1 that made a U-Turn to travel westbound. That vehicle made the U-Turn and V1 made a left turn directly behind that vehicle. The front of V2 struck the right front area of V1 as it was making a left turn in the intersection. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and travel west in the #1 lane before it came to rest facing west. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest at the northwest corner of the intersection facing in a northwesterly direction. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 said that he was stopped behind another car in the left turn lane for more than 10 seconds. He said that the vehicle in front of him then began to make a U-turn. He then began to make his left turn and then looked to his right and saw V2. He hit his brakes but was struck on the right side by V2. He said that he was looking at his turn destination just prior to looking to his right when he saw V2. He said that he did not see V2 approaching before he began to make his left turn. The vehicle was removed form the scene and later towed.
