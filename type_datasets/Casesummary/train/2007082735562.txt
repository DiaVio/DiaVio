This daytime two-vehicle collision occurred on a two-lane north/south roadway. The asphalt-paved roadway has a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) and is straight and level. At the time of the crash the sky was clear and the road was dry.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Lexus RX 330 SUV driven by a fifty four (54) year old male, was headed north in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Saturn 4 door sedan driven by a seventeen (17) year old female, was headed south in lane one. V1 was stopped in the right parking lane of the roadway waiting to use the driveway across as a turn around to park down the roadway. After he had waited for a couple cars to go by he proceeded to make his turn in front of V2. V1's front plane contacted the front plane of V2 and caused V2's front plane to collide into the rear plane of vehicle three (V3), a 1999 Honda Civic that was parked legally along the right side of the southbound direction of travel. V3 was then pushed into another parked vehicle. Both V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
