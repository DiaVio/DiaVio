This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a “T” intersection. The intersection was composed of an east/west seven-lane roadway intersected by a three-lane north/south roadway and controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. The east/west roadway was bituminous, dry, straight, and level, with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Honda Accord with one occupant was eastbound in lane 4 (the designated left turn only lane) approaching the intersection where it intended to make a U-turn. V2, a 1998 Ford Escort with three occupants, was westbound in lane two approaching the same intersection where it intended to go straight. V1 failed to yield the right of way and began its U-turn as V2 entered the intersection. The front right corner of V1 was struck by the front left corner of V2. The vehicles than side-slapped and came to final rest in the westbound lanes of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 21-year-old female, suffered minor injuries but did not require transport. She stated that as she approached the intersection with the green light she looked but did not see any approaching vehicles. She thought the intersection was clear and she began her turn. She did not see V2 until it was too late and all she could do was brace herself.
The driver of V2, a 17-year-old female, was not injured in the crash. Neither of her two teen-aged passengers were injured either. She stated that she saw V1 coming into the intersection but assumed that it would wait until she passed. When it did not she slammed on her brakes and attempted to swerve but it was too late.
