The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a four-lane roadway. There were three westbound lanes and one eastbound lane on the east side of the intersection. There were three eastbound lanes (one right turn, one straight and one left turn only) and two westbound lanes on the west side of the intersection. Both roadways were asphalt, straight and dry. The east/westbound road was level. The north/southbound road was level in the intersection, and had a a 3.3% slope uphill for southbound traffic. The posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph) and traffic in all directions was controlled by overhanging traffic signals without pedestrian control. Conditions at the time were daylight with overcast skies in the early afternoon on a weekday (midday lunch rush in an industrial/urban section of town).
V1 was a 2005 Toyota Tundra Pickup (2wd) traveling east and turning left/north from lane three on the west leg of the intersection on a solid green signal. V2 was a 2002 Ford E350 Van used as a bus (no passengers) that was traveling west through the intersection in lane one. V3 was a 2003 Volkswagen Jetta that was stopped in lane one southbound waiting for a green light. As V1 proceeded with its left turn it was following a Non-Contact (NC) dually pickup truck when V1 was struck on the right side near its rear by the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and its left side (also near the back) struck the front of V3 where it (V3) was stopped. V3 was pushed back several meters by the impact and came to rest facing south in its original travel lane. V1 came to rest facing northeast after contacting V3. V1 and V3 were towed from the scene. V2 proceeded through the intersection after the first impact and came to a controlled stop on the north sidewalk facing west on the west leg of the intersection. V2 was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 59 year-old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. He was following his son (son driving NC vehicle) to his place of business at the time of the crash.
V2 was driven by a 35 year-old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. He was on duty with his company vehicle (V2) and was on his way to pickup a passenger when the crash occurred. He stated that he was stopped at the red light, it turned green and he was accelerating into the intersection at the time of the crash.
V3 was driven by a 25 year-old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. His statement (as he had a front row seat to the 1st and 2nd events) corroborated the researchers findings as to the sequence of events and traffic flow (NC vehicle positioning etcâ€¦)
