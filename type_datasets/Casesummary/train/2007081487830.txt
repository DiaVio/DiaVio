This single-vehicle crash occurred in the early morning daylight hours. The location was on a two-way, five-lane, bituminous, snow-covered roadway. The roadway was straight with a 2% uphill grade in the eastbound direction. The weather was cloudy, and the snowfall had reduced to lightly snowing. The roadway was snow-covered, and wet, but not icy. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan driven by a seventeen (17) year old male, was traveling eastbound up a slight hill. The driver was going to turn right into a private drive at the business complex on the right side of the road. Before reaching the driveway, the driver lost control of the vehicle rotating clockwise. V1 departed the roadway via the right shoulder, with the driver's side leading. The left A-pillar area of V1 impacted a very large sign, and the vehicle rotated counter clockwise coming to rest facing eastbound under the sign. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1's pre-crash factors are unknown as there was a language barrier on-scene when the researcher attempted the interview.
