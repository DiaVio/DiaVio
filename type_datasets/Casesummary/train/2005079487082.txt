Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Ford E-250 van, was traveling eastbound in the fourth lane of a seven-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. V1 was stopped in the intersection and awaiting an opportunity to turn left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Toyota Camry, was traveling eastbound in the second lane of opposing traffic, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle three (V3), a 1992 Dodge Caravan, was stopped at the entrance to the intersection facing south in the first lane of a two-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, and awaiting an opportunity to turn right. As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles rotated clockwise and moved northwest. V2 came to rest in the intersection. V1 entered the first southbound lane, where the left side of V1 contacted the front of V3, bringing V1 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The 48-year-old female driver of V3 was stopped and awaiting an opportunity to turn right into westbound traffic.

V3 was not involved in the first harmful event, and the critical reason is not attributed to V3.
