There were two southbound lanes and an acceleration lane at the crash site. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this early morning weekday crash.
Vehicle #1, a 1997 Honda Civic, was traveling south in the passing lane (lane 3) of the interstate. A non-contact vehicle moved into the path of Vehicle #1 from the right. The operator of Vehicle #1 attempted to avoid the non-contact vehicle by steering to the right. Vehicle #1 began to rotate clockwise and across the driving and acceleration lanes. Vehicle #1 continued off the right side of the roadway striking a delineator with its left side and then striking a rock embankment with its front. Vehicle #1 continued to rotate clockwise, came back on the roadway and came to rest facing in a northwesterly direction. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
