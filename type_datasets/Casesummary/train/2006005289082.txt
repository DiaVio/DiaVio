This three-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours in the middle of a four-way intersection. The north/south roadway was not physically divided and consisted of two lanes, one in each direction. The driveway heading east was composed of two lanes. The grade for all vehicles involved was determined to be level. The posted speed limit for the north/south roadway was 56kph (35mph). There was no posted speed limit for the driveway, however, on access roads such as this, 24kph (15mph) is the most common limit. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and the roadway was dry.
