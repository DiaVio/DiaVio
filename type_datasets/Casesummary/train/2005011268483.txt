V2, a 1996 Ford Ranger compact pick-up driven by a 16 year-old male, came to final rest facing southwest partially in the driveway. The driver of v2 stated that he saw v1 put his blinker on to turn left as he was approaching, but that v2 did not stop and wait for traffic to pass and instead just slowed a bit and then turned right in front of v2. The driver of v2 had no time for any avoidance actions. The driver and passenger airbags deployed and v2 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver and right front occupant of v2 were transported to a local trauma center from the scene of the crash where they were treated and released later that evening.
