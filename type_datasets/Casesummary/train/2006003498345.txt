The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way roadway with one lane in each direction. The roadway was straight, level, bituminous, and it was daylight and clear with no adverse conditions. The speed limit was 48kmph (30mph) and the traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2000 Chevrolet Venture minivan, with one occupant was traveling southbound. V2, a 1993 Buick Regal two door, with one occupant was traveling northbound. V1 attempted to make a left turn when the front impacted the left side of V2. V2 rotated counter-clockwise and then the right side of V2 impacted the back/left of V3, a legally parked and unoccupied 2006 Mercedes Benz CLK350. Then V2 rotated clockwise and came to a final rest approximately 18 meters north of the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Chevrolet Venture, was driven by a 38 year-old female who reported no injuries. She stated to the Police that she was attempting to turn left into the driveway and that V2 was far away when she began to turn left. The driver declined to participate in the survey. It is believed that she was making a left turn to park because her relatives lived in the building near the crash site.
V2, the 1995 Buick Regal, was driven by a 61 year-old male who reported no injuries. The driver stated to the Police that V2 was attempting to make an illegal U-turn. The driver of V2 declined to participate in the study.
