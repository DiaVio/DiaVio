The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way, five-lane, undivided roadway. The center lane consisted of a two-way left turn lane. There were two eastbound lanes, with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a straight, level, and asphalt roadway. Conditions were dusk on a weekday evening with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1993 Toyota Celica 2-door coupe with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane two. V2, a 2004 Ford F-150 pickup with three occupants, was also traveling eastbound in lane two, ahead of V1. A bicyclist crossed the street from south to north, in front of V2. This caused the driver of V2 to come to a sudden stop. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1, the Toyota Celica, was driven by a 37-year old female, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. She stated that she had just stopped to pick up an order at a nearby restaurant on her way to work. While at the restaurant, the driver's taste changed, and she left without her food. The driver knew of another restaurant along the way, and decided she would call in an order along the way, having it delivered. As the driver followed behind V2, she began looking off to the right, for the telephone number of the restaurant, which was painted on the front of the building. Due to the distraction, she did not immediately see V2 suddenly stop. By the time she did, it was too late.
V2, the Ford F-150, was driven by a 47-year old male, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. He stated that he and his passengers were on their way to a friend's house from a nearby store. According to the motorist, a cyclist crossed in front of him, forcing him to slam on his brakes. Although the driver was able to avoid the cyclist, he was immediately hit from behind by V1.
