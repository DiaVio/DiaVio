The crash occurred in the northbound lanes on a level bituminous four lane divided roadway (two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes) with a posted speed limit of 105 KMPH (65 mph). The roadway was divided by a grass median with a positive w-beam guardrail barrier. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this early morning weekend crash. Traffic flow was normal for that time of day.
V1, a 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer, was traveling north on the roadway in lane one. V1 entered the passing lane to pass a non-contact vehicle. V1 passed the vehicle, returned to lane one and went off the right side of the roadway striking a delineator with its front. V1 corrected to the left to re-enter the roadway and began to rotate counterclockwise. V1 continued to rotate across the both northbound lanes, off the left side of the roadway and struck the median guardrail with its right side. V1 then continued to rotated counterclockwise and struck the guardrail again with its right side. V1 came to rest facing in a southerly direction. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The Chevrolet Trailblazer was driven by a belted 85 year old male who was transported, treated and released but was not injured. The driver stated that he was passing a car and was pulling back in when he thinks he hit the gavel on the side of the shoulder of the road and his car fishtailed, did a 360-degree spin and hit the guardrail. He did indicate to the police that he wanted to drive the vehicle from the scene as he needed to be somewhere at a certain time. No further information was obtained as the driver refused an interview.
