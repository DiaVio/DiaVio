The crash occurred on an undivided east/west two-lane roadway at an intersection with a one-way northbound roadway. The east/west roadway was straight, level, and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph). The crash occurred during the late afternoon hours of a weekday, and it was dusk, cloudy and wet. The traffic flow was congested, with stop and go activity.
V1, a 1990 BMW 5-Series four door sedan with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one. V2, a 2000 Chevrolet G-Series van with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one a short distance behind V1, behind other non-contact vehicles. Due to the congested traffic, the driver of V1 decided to turn left onto the one-way roadway. At approximately the same time, the driver of V2 was driving the wrong way in the westbound lane with the same intent as the driver of V1 - to avoid the traffic ahead by turning left at the intersection. V1 turned left as V2 approached from V1's left side. The front right of V2 impacted the left side of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest near impact point. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the BMW, was driven by a 36 year-old male who reported minor injuries and was transported to a medical facility. The driver advised that he was commuting home from work, and there was traffic so he decided to turn left to use another street, when V2 was already coming down the road on the wrong side.
V2, the Chevrolet G-Series van, was driven by a 23 year-old male who reported no injuries. He advised that there was heavy traffic in the eastbound lane, so he drove the wrong way in the westbound lane to make a left at the intersection. When he got to the corner, V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection and caused the crash.
