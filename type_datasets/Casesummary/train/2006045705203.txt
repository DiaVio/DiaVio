This crash occurred just after noon on a weekend in the westbound lanes of a divided, east/west interstate highway. The highway consisted of three lanes in each direction flanked by paved emergency shoulders divided by a concrete barrier wall with a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55 mph). The bituminous highway was dry and level and featured a slight (immeasurable) curve left (south). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions but the traffic flow was interrupted by construction ahead and the subsequent congestion at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2005 Toyota Camry, was westbound in the left lane three approaching the traffic congestion. V2, a 2007 International tractor (heavy truck) pulling an almost empty dry trailer was slowly moving forward in lane two. As V1 approached the congestion it swerved to the right to avoid the vehicle in front of it and struck the back of V2's trailer unit with its front. V1 rotated about 20 degrees clockwise before coming to final rest near the point of impact. V2 called police and pulled to the right shoulder of the highway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a belted 33-year-old female who was on her way go get lunch from her jobsite. She stated she came up on the congestion and did not realize that traffic was stopped until it was too late; she swerved right and hit the truck. She was transported to a local trauma center with non-incapacitating injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a belted 36-year-old male who was uninjured in the crash. He was on his way from one delivery to the next (and last of the day) when he was hit from behind. He stated he saw a car coming up rapidly behind him but could not get out of the way. V2 was driven from the scene.
