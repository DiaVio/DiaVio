The crash occurred at an intersection. The north/south roadway was a two-way, five-lane undivided roadway. The east/west roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street controlled by a stop sign. These were straight, level, asphalt roads. The posted speed for north/south traffic was 64 kmph (40 mph). The posted speed for east/west traffic was 48 kmph (30 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was congested.
V1, a 1995 Mazda Protégé, was traveling westbound in lane one. V2, a 2005 GMC Canyon pickup truck, was traveling northbound in lane two. V3, a 1999 Plymouth Breeze, was traveling southbound in lane two. All three vehicles were approaching the same intersection. A traffic light just north of the intersection caused traffic in northbound lane one to be backed up all the way to the intersection. V1 attempted to turn left through an opening left by the stopped vehicles. As V1 entered the intersection, the front of V1 made contact with the right side of V2. V2 then traveled northwest, into oncoming traffic. The front of V2 collided head-on with V3. The driver of V1 fled the scene. Approximately ten to fifteen minutes after the crash, V3's engine compartment caught fire and V3 was completely burned. The driver and two passengers of V3 were transported due to injury. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
The police department did not want the driver of V3, a police officer, to be interviewed. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. There were no associated factors coded for this driver. She was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
