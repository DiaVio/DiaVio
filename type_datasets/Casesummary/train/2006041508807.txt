The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, six-lane interstate roadway, which was physically divided by a concrete traffic barrier. There were three southbound lanes flanked by paved shoulders. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with clear skies and normal traffic flow.
V1, a 1997 International 4700 medium/heavy truck with one occupant, was southbound in lane one. V2, a 1987 Ford LT9000 medium/heavy truck with one occupant, was also southbound in lane one, ahead of V1. V3, a 2006 Chrysler Pacifica with one occupant, was southbound in lane two, slightly behind V1. As V1 attempted to make a lane change into lane two the right side of its trailer struck the left rear corner of V2. As V1 continued its lane change the front left corner struck the right front corner of V3 despite the fact V3 swerved left in an attempt to avoid V1. This impact forced V3 off the roadway, over the paved shoulder and into the concrete barrier wall where it came to final rest after severely damaging the wall. V1 came to final rest on the left shoulder while V2 came to rest on the right shoulder. V1 and V3 were towed due to damage while V2 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 24-year old female, was transported to the hospital due to non-incapacitating injuries. The vehicle was removed prior to this researcher's arrival and could not be located for an inspection. Subsequent attempts to contact the driver for an interview proved unsuccessful.
The driver of V2, a 32-year old male, was not injured. This researcher did not receive permission to inspect the vehicle and the driver could not be reached for an interview.
The driver of V3, a 31-year old male, was uninjured in the crash. The driver declined to be interviewed, pending litigation.
