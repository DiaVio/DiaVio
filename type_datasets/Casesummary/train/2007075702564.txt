The north/south roadway is on the north side of the east/west roadway. This roadway is straight, level, undivided and controlled by a stop sign in the southbound direction. The speed limit for this roadway is 40 kmph (25 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadways were wet.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford F150 pickup, was stopped southbound at the stop sign, waiting to turn left (east). Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Chevrolet S10 Blazer, was westbound in lane three. Several non-contact vehicles were stopped in lane two (east and west of the intersection) for a bus that was stopped west of the intersection. The driver of V1 did not see the vehicles in lane three and proceeded into the intersection to make a left turn. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a twenty-year-old male, was traveling with a nineteen-year-old female, from school to a store. This driver was healthy, well rested and comfortable with his vehicle and passenger. He travels this route weekly. This driver stated that he could not see lane three but thought that all of the westbound traffic was stopping.
The driver of V2, a nineteen-year-old male, was on his way home from work. He was well rested, healthy and familiar with his vehicle and this roadway that he travels on daily. This driver stated that he did not see V1 until just prior to the crash and applied the brakes at that time in an attempt to avoid the crash.
