This single vehicle rollover occurred on a three-lane asphalt constructed roadway. This roadway runs east to west with two lanes going east and one lane going west. The westbound lane in on a downgrade of -6 percent and is straight then curves right at the bottom of the grade. This crash occurred during daylight in a heavy rainstorm with rainwater moving down the grade. The posted speed limit is 105 kmph (65 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Ford F-150 super cab, was westbound descending this grade when it began to rotate clockwise due to the heavy water on the roadway. The driver steered into the rotation and the vehicle responded by fish tailing in the opposite direction. The driver again tried to counter the rotation but the vehicle continued to rotate clockwise and spun 180 degrees and exited the right road edge going backwards. Once off the roadway V1 bounced through a bar ditch and up a vertical embankment. Once on the embankment V1 tripped with the right wheels and rolled longitudinally 4 quarter turns coming to rest on its wheels heading in a southerly direction. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
The 18 year-old female driver stated that the rain was coming down in sheets and that she had the vehicle wipers on max speed. She stated that she had thought about stopping because of the rain but she could not find a safe pull out to stop. She is very familiar with this roadway and drives it daily. She has driven this road in other rainstorms but not in this exact spot. She stated that once the vehicle hydroplaned that she had no control. The driver and 4 occupants were all in use of the lap and shoulder belts and protected by non-deployed frontal airbags. Only occupant #2 was transported for injuries. V1 was towed for roll over damages.
