The driver of the vehicle, a male in his late 20's to early 30's suffered some bruising and lacerations, but did not require transportation to a medical facility. The researcher did speak with the driver who stated that another vehicle, which was traveling in the opposite direction, crossed the double yellow lines. This in turn caused V1 to steer to the right to avoid the collision. After he exited the roadway, the driver tried to steer back to the left, but lost control of the vehicle.
