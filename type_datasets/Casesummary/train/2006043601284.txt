This two-vehicle crash occurred in eastbound lane one of a 2-lane divided highway where a crossover and 2-lane country road intersect. The highway runs east and west with a grass median dividing the two directions. The westbound traffic has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) as it is exiting a residential community and the eastbound traffic has a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph) as the highway ends and enters the residential district. The roadway was flat, dry, and was daylight.
V1, a 2000 Chevrolet Impala with one occupant, was traveling west when it stopped at a crossover to make a left turn. V2, a 1996 Chrysler Town & Country with one occupant, was traveling east in lane one toward the same crossover. V1 entered the eastbound lanes and struck V2 on the left side {event #1}. Following that impact, V2 departed the right side of the roadway and struck a utility pole with its right front corner {event #2}. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage but neither driver was treated for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 62-year-old male that works as an assembler at an electrical manufacturer. For this trip today, this driver was returning home from work on the same roadway he travels each day and unintentionally turned in front of V2. He states he was headed west and stopped at the crossover while eastbound traffic passed. While waiting at the intersection, an unknown vehicle traveling east in lane one, stopped in its lane to allow this driver to make a left turn. This driver claimed the other driver in the unknown vehicle waived him through as if the roadway was clear, but when this driver “eased out” across the eastbound lanes, he struck V2. This driver admitted that he turned with an obstructed view (the unknown vehicle) and that this was his first crash in ten years.
