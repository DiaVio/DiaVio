This crash occurred in the afternoon rush hour of a weekday at an intersection of an undivided five-lane (with a center two-way left turn lane) urban roadway and the exit of a commercial driveway. The three eastbound lanes of the urban roadway were dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). All three lanes contained stopped traffic that was backed up awaiting a traffic signal to changes colors at an intersection ahead. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2003 Subaru Imprezza, was facing north exiting a commercial driveway intending to turn left. V2, a 2005 Scion (Toyota) XA, was eastbound traveling in the two-way left turn lane, which was not backed up from the stoplight. V3, a 1996 Mercury Sable, was stopped in lane three of the eastbound lanes ahead of the commercial drive that V1 was exiting. The stopped traffic had allowed room for V1 to travel through so as to turn left onto the roadway. As V1 proceeded across the eastbound lanes and into the left turn lane its front contacted the right side of V2. This impact caused V2 to roll left two quarter turns and skid east on it's top, while rotating counter-clockwise. While rotating on its roof, the front of V2 contacted the left side of V3. V2 came to rest facing northeast while still upside down. V1 and V3 came to final rest still in their initial directions near their respective points of impact. V2 was towed due to damage. The driver of v2 was injured and transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a belted 27 year-old male in good health who was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (near-sighted) condition. The driver stated he had enough room to get through the traffic but could not see around all the vehicles. The driver was uninjured and V1 was driven from the scene.
V2 was driven by a belted 20 year-old female in good health who was on her way home after running an errand. She stated she never saw V1 enter her lane from the right and did not have a chance to take evasive action. The driver was transported with non-incapacitating injuries and V2 was towed due to damage.
V3 was driven by a belted 54 year-old female in good health despite a history of high cholesterol, which is treated with medication. She was wearing her prescription lenses that correct a myopic (near-sighted) condition.
