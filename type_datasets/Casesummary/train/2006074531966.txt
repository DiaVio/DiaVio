This single event, single-vehicle crash occurred along a 3-lane, non-divided, concrete, level, curved, industrial throughway with a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). It was a clear sunny weekday afternoon with no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan with two occupants had just turned onto the road in lane 1, when the front right CV joint broke on the suspension. This caused the car to exit the roadway to the right and collide with an overhead light pole. The right front tire rode up the pole almost 2 feet (55 centimeters). The forward momentum continued to pull the car forward, causing sideswipe damage to the right front of the vehicle. The vehicle continued on approximately 10 meters (33-feet) to final rest on the grass to the right of the roadway. The impact with the pole caused the airbags to deploy. The excessive dust and powder from these older airbags got into the eyes of the passenger causing a burning sensation. EMS was dispatched and passenger was transported to hospital with a possible injury. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 was a 26-year-old male who was not taking any medications. He intended to go straight around the curve. He and his brother were heading home from classes at the community college, a route they drove daily. He told the interviewer that he had the oil changed 2 days before crash, and the mechanic had warned him that the CV joint was going to fail soon. The driver thought he had a little more time to get it fixed. Although the PAR indicates this vehicle was left at the scene, it was obviously not in driveable condition and was towed to a repair shop later that day. Researcher followed up and documented the mechanical failure at that location.
