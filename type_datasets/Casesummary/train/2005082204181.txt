There was an illuminated sign prior to the bridge warning motorist of icy conditions.
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 2000 Ford Ranger pickup, was traveling east in lane one. The driver normally drives an AWD vehicle instead of the subject vehicle, which is a RWD. There was an icy patch on the roadway from factory steam that had frozen overnight. As the driver of the vehicle down shifted to 2nd gear the rear wheels lost traction on an icy patch and the vehicle initiated a clockwise rotation. The driver steered hard left as the vehicle exited the icy patch, the vehicle crossed lane two before the front of the vehicle struck the median barrier. The vehicle rotated clockwise as the right rear corner struck the median barrier before coming to rest. The driver was not injured and the vehicle was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
