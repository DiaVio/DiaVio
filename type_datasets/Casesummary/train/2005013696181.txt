This crash occurred on a two-lane, non-divided rural, asphalt roadway during the early hours of the morning with the sun shining brightly to the drivers rear. The road way was straight, with a negative 6% downhill slope. The asphalt road was wet from the evening dew that had accumulated on it.
The vehicle was heading south cresting the hill, on his way home from work. The driver of the vehicle saw a deer approaching the right side of the roadway. The diver stated that he thought the deer was going to enter the road in front of him. The driver then stated that he steered hard to the left, lost control; crossed the left lane striking the guardrail on the east side of the road. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
A 28-year-old male was driving V1 a 1999 Ford Taurus. The driver stated that the car was his mother's car and that he had only driven it a few times before that day. V1 was towed away from the scene because the impact damaged the radiator and the transmission cooler. The vehicle lost all of its antifreeze and transmission fluid. The driver of V1 was only sore from the impact and did not require any medical treatment (EMS was canceled before arrival).
