This two-vehicle crash occurred approximately 8 meters (26 feet) before a four-way, stop sign-controlled intersection. On the west side of the intersection, the roadway is divided by a curbed median and the eastbound traffic lanes normally consist of three through lanes and a left turn lane, but because the roadway was covered with snow and the lane lines were not visible at the time of the crash, through traffic was restricted to two through lanes. This crash occurred in the mid-afternoon hours on a weekend with moderate traffic flow.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Mercury Tracer with one occupant, was eastbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Jeep Cherokee with five occupants, was eastbound in lane two, in front of V1. The driver of V2 did not apply the brakes, but had slowed down for the slick road conditions. The driver of V1 applied the brakes and tried to steer to the left to avoid an impact with V2, but the front of V1 collided with the back of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest near the point of impact. In a separate crash that occurred soon afterwards, V1 was rear-ended by a vehicle that was unable to stop for the first collision and was pushed into V2 again. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a thirty-one-year-old male, was driving from a friend's house and going to his girlfriend's house. He was well rested, very comfortable with his vehicle, and drives this route monthly. He is in good health, was well rested and takes Prozac on a regular basis for depression.
The driver of V2, a thirty-eight-year-old female, was driving from a department store to her home. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle and passenger load, and drives this route weekly. She is in good health and takes no medications.
