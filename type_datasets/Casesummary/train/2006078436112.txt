A two vehicle rear-end collision occurred in mid-afternoon on a four-lane, two-way road with two lanes in each direction. The roadway was dry, straight & level with no traffic controls. There were driveways for various businesses adjacent to the roadway. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).
The driver of V1 was an 18-year-old male who was on an errand from home to pick up his brother at school. He claimed not to be in a hurry and had no concerns with family and is not employed. He drives this route weekly and has been driving for just 12 months. Prior to impact he had turned his head to the right and was looking rearward at traffic in the adjacent right travel lane. The vehicle was not equipped with a right side mirror which forced the driver to turn his head to see traffic to his right.When he looked forward he observed that V2 had stopped in front of his vehicle and attempted to avoid V2 by braking but could not avoid the impact.
