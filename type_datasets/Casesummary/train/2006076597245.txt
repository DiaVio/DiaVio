Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier sedan with three occupants, was southbound negotiating the right hand curve when the driver saw a large elk standing in the southbound travel lane. The driver applied the brakes and took evasive action by steering left to avoid this animal. V1 rotated counter-clockwise while crossing the centerline and exited the left road edge leading with the right front bumper corner. As V1 exited the road edge the right front corner impacted the embankment then rotated counter-clockwise where the right side struck a chevron sign post before the right side struck the embankment. All occupants were checked and released at the crash scene. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1.
A 48-year-old female who drives the route monthly and is familiar with the vehicle drove V1. The driver was on her way from her residence to shop at a nearby town. She had already traveled 65 miles before the crash occurred. She claimed to be well rested. She was in conversation with the two passengers when the crash occurred and failed to look far enough ahead and detect the animal in time to avoid the crash. The driver overcompensated by steering hard left, lost control of the vehicle and struck the embankment.
