This two-vehicle crash occurred at a four-leg, uncontrolled intersection in a rural area. The north-south roadway is a clearly marked construction zone with a speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This concrete roadway is two-lane, undivided, two-way and straight. The northbound traffic lane is level and the southbound traffic lane has a 2% uphill grade. This crash occurred during daylight hours with traffic congestion but no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Chevy Silverado pickup, was northbound approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Chevy Silverado pickup, was southbound, intending to turn left at the intersection. In the intersection, the front of V1 struck the front of V2. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest facing north/northeast in the intersection. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing southeast north of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a sixty-four-year-old male, was traveling from his home to a car dealership. He had recently purchased the vehicle, but was very comfortable driving it. He was well rested and very familiar with his route. This driver has heart problems and takes Vasotec, Lipitor, Imdur and Aspirin. He noticed V2 slowing to turn left at the intersection and assumed that V2 would yield the right of way.
The driver of V2, a thirty-one-year-old male, was traveling from a campsite to his home. He was well rested and his health was good. He was very familiar with his vehicle, but drives this route rarely. He stated, "I don't know where my head was." His focus as he was approaching the intersection was ensuring that he turned onto the correct road and he did not notice V1 prior to the crash, an inadequate surveillance factor.
