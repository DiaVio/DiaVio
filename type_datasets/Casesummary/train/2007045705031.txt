The crash occurred on a straight, level, two-way, two-lane road that ran north/south and was only divided by a painted double yellow line. The east side of the road had a drainage ditch that was freshly dug with vertical sides and a depth of 2.6 meters at the rollover initiation point. The crash occurred under daylight and dry conditions around mid morning on a weekday. The speed limit for the road was 64kph.
V1 was a 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera traveling north on the road when a police officer initiated a traffic stop for (the officer related to the researcher) window tinting that appeared too dark for state law. When V1 attempted to pull over to the right shoulder and slow to a stop the brakes failed and V1 drove into the drain ditch on the east side of the road, rolling Â¼ turn onto its right and coming to rest on its right side facing north. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a twenty-three-year-old-belted male who was uninjured in the crash as were his two passengers. He had just picked up his girlfriend and 3-week-old baby boy for a scheduled doctor visit. The driver stated that he knew the brakes were bad and that they made him nervous. He had just purchased the car a week previous and had not had a chance to get any work done on the vehicle.
