This two-vehicle collision occurred in a controlled four-way intersection mid-afternoon on a Thursday. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions and there were no roadway defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Lincoln Continental four-door sedan, was traveling westbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the second lane of a five-lane, divided (seven lanes overall, divided by a raised median), dry, level, concrete roadway, approaching an intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Mack Dump Truck, was traveling southbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the second lane of a three-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, concrete roadway, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. V2 was equipped with four axles, axle number two was a drop axle and was not in use. V2 was fully loaded at this time. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 failed to recognize the red traffic light. The driver realized too late that he was violating the traffic signal, and applied his brakes to avoid a collision with V2. As both vehicles crossed the intersection, the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2 continued forward and came to rest in its original lane. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest alongside V2, facing southwest.
