This crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane, rural roadway. There was one westbound lane and one eastbound lane. This roadway had an S-bend that first curved to the left and then back to the right. As the roadway curves to the right there was an uphill grade, while exiting the curve there is a downhill grade. The roadway was bituminous and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was dawn on a weekend and conditions were clear.
V1, a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt, driven by a 17 year-old female. She was commuting to work on a drivers license that allowed only occupational trips. V1 was traveling westbound and had just negotiated the left curve and began entering the right curve when the tires began to lose their grip. As the vehicle crested the hill it crossed the left lane line, continued through the turn and crossed back into its original lane. The vehicle then crossed back over into lane two and off of the roadway where it struck a tree stump. The ground in this area was covered in approximately one half of a foot of snow. The vehicle then began to roll longitudinally to the left. It then went down a small hill striking several trees and landing on its roof in a shallow creek bed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 129 kmph for V1.
