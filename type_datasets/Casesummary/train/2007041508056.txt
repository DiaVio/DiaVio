The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of an eight-lane interstate roadway, which was divided by a concrete traffic barrier. There were four northbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a straight, level, and asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1988 Jeep Cherokee with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one. The left rear tire experienced a partial tread separation, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. V1 veered to the right, off the right side of the roadway, rotating in a clockwise direction. The front of V1 struck a concrete wall. V1 then rolled to the left, six quarter-turns, coming to final rest in the emergency shoulder, on its rooftop. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The Jeep Cherokee was driven by a 35-year old male, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. He stated that he was on his way to work, when he heard a noise that sounded like the axle broke and fell on the road. Immediately after hearing the sound, he heard the blowout of the tire. The driver indicated that his vehicle went airborne after that. When he landed on the road again, he was facing oncoming traffic. He immediately felt something hit the back of his vehicle. The motorist said that he rolled over twice before coming to a complete stop. He was in the back of his vehicle, which was upside down.
