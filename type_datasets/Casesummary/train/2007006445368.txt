This one-vehicle crash occurred during the late-evening hours of a weekday. The collision took place on an urban roadway near an intersection of two one-way streets. The northbound roadway was a two-lane street, with parking designated off to the left hand side of the roadway. It had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The surface type for the roadway was that of bituminous asphalt. The roadway was flat, wet, and level; there was no indication of any physical damage. Weather conditions were rainy and dark, but streetlights were present to illuminate the roadways. The roadway was governed by traffic lights (with pedestrian crossing), all of which were functioning properly.
Vehicle one, a Oldsmobile Regency 4-door sedan, was traveling northbound in lane two of the roadway when it proceeded to make a left hand turn onto the westbound trafficway. Upon completing the turn, V1 veered off to the left side of the road, departed the roadway, and struck a traffic light head-on. V1 suffered severe damage to its front-end and had to be towed from the scene. All three occupants in the vehicle were transported to a nearby hospital for treatment. The driver suffered a contusion to his forehead. The right-rear passenger suffered lacerations to her face (that required stitches). The front-right passenger suffered back pain. The driver was then arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. It was unknown whether or not the occupants were restrained. The front right of the windshield was cracked (webbing pattern). The vehicle was not equipped with airbags. The approximate speed was unknown. The traffic light that was struck had to be replaced. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 41 year-old male, could not be reached for an interview. There were also several attempts to contact the passengers; all of which were unsuccessful. The passengers were both female, ages 19 and 39. It is unknown if the three were related.
