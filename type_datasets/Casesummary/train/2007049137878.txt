This two-vehicle crash occurred on a divided, straight roadway near a hillcrest. The northbound lanes consist of five travel lanes. The speed limit on this roadway is 96 kmph (60 mph). This crash occurred during morning daylight hours with moderate traffic. There was no inclement weather at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Mack truck with a single trailer, was northbound in lane four. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Mercedes-Benz C230, was northbound in lane three slightly ahead of V1. V1 attempted to merge into the third lane and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2. V2 began to rotate counterclockwise and the left side of V2 was struck by the front of V1. V2 continued to rotate and the right side struck the concrete traffic barrier. V1 then rotated across the roadway and the front struck the guardrail. V2 came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder. V2 was towed due to damage while V1 was driven. Neither driver was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a sixty-two year-old male, was traveling back to his office after dropping off his payload. He was healthy, well rested and familiar with his vehicle. This driver had never driven on this roadway previously. This driver stated that he looked into his rearview mirror and thought that lane three was clear. He did not see V2 prior to impact although the driver checked for traffic in lane three before attempting to change lanes to the right. View obstruction due to vehicle design was a contributing factor.
The driver of V2 was forty-seven year-old female. Some of the interview questions were not answered due to a language barrier. She was well rested, in good health and comfortable with her vehicle. This driver has driven on this roadway daily.
