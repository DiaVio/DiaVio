The crash occurred in the middle of a T-intersection. There were four-lanes running westbound separating the eastbound lanes with a concrete median. The intersecting roadway ran southbound with three lanes. The conditions were dry and clear on a weekday afternoon during rush hour. The roadway was straight and level. The posted speed was 56 KPH (40 MPH).
V1 was a 1996 Pontiac Grand Am that was traveling westbound in lane four, which was a left turn only lane. The driver had a green light (not a green arrow) and attempted to make the left turn. As the driver was almost through the intersection she was hit on her right rear back by V2, a 1995 Chevy 1500 truck, causing her to lose control and hit a telephone pole. V2 was heading eastbound in lane one with a green light. The driver stated he was approaching the traffic light and the red car (V1) decided to try to turn in front of him. Both drivers were towed due to damages and both drivers were transported due to injury. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 46-year-old woman who was on her way home from work. She was heading westbound in lane four and was attempting a left turn. The driver stated that the truck (V2) ran a red light. There was a witness that was behind V1 that happened to be her friend. The driver stated that she had a green light and assumed any other traffic had to yield to her. The officer believed her friends story and gave the ticket to V2. V1 was cited for no proof of insurance.
V2 was driven by a 39-year-old male who was traveling eastbound in lane one. The driver had a green light and was approaching the intersection when V1 tried to make the turn thinking she had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that he was almost to the light and it was green. As she was right in front of him he hit his brakes but was not able to avoid the crash. The driver was cited for the crash by the officer on scene.
