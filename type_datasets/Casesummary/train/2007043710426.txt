This single vehicle rollover crash occurred off the right side of the roadway at a T-intersection. The two-lane north/south roadway is undivided with grass shoulders. The southbound approach curves right with a 3% super-elevation, then straightens out with a level surface. The intersecting roadway from the east is also undivided with two lanes. The southeast corner of the intersection contained a ditch that that from the roadway drops at a -33% slope. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The setting was afternoon hours on a weekday and conditions were daylight, sunny and dry.
V1, a 1993 GMC Suburban with two occupants, was southbound in lane one. As V1 approached the T-intersection, it intended on turning left. V1 made its turn too wide and drove off the right side of the roadway. V1 left 19 meters (62 feet) of yaw marks prior to departing the roadway. When V1 departed the roadway, its right wheels sunk in the mud at the bottom of the ditch. V1 rolled right one-quarter turn and came final rest in the ditch facing east on its right side. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 16 year-old female, was not injured in the crash. Her and her 15 year-old passenger decided to skip the second half of school for the day. She claimed that her friend had just noticed she lost her wallet somewhere near the school. They wanted to turn around and go look for it. She only had her license for 9 months and was neutral about the handling of her vehicle. She had only been on this roadway twice and while driving 56 kmph (35 mph), she saw a road to the left to turn down and ultimately make a U-turn. She says she was going too fast and decided too late to attempt the left turn, but did it anyway. She ran off the road to the right, slid into a ditch and her right side sunk in the mud causing her SUV to overturn.
