The accident occurred on a Wednesday evening on a straight, flat, and unlit residential roadway. The roadway is two lanes and undivided. V1 was traveling northbound, driven by a 22 year old female. The vehicle is a 2001 Suzuki Swift.
The driver had traveled about 1/8th of a mile from its starting location when V1 struck the rear of a legally parked vehicle. V1 was struck on the front right and rotated around the parked vehicle. As the vehicle pivoted it tripped over its left side wheels and completed four Â¼ turns, landing on its tires. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver suffered a concussion in the accident and was not able to recall many details of the crash. From the few details the driver could provide and the circumstances of the scene it seems likely that the driver did not scan the area around her adequately to react to the parked vehicle.
