This single-vehicle collision occurred early in the evening in darkness. The collision occurred on a rural two-way, two-lane undivided roadway. The pre-crash roadway is level, and straight with bituminous paving. The weather was cloudy with fog, raining, and visibility was not very good, the roadway was very wet. This roadway has a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Mazda MX-3 2-door sedan driven by a nineteen (19) year old male, was traveling northbound in lane one. Something darted out in the roadway directly in front of V1; the driver avoided this critter by steering to the left, then right. While steering to the right the vehicle lost traction and rotated clockwise. V1 then departed the roadway via the right shoulder, and the front of V1 impacted a dirt embankment, and then continued in a northwest direction before coming to final rest. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1's pre-crash factors are mostly unknown, as he was only available for a quick statement on-scene and unable to be reached later for a further interview.
