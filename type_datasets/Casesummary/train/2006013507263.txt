This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday on the roadsides of the southbound lanes of an expressway. The north/south expressway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a concrete traffic barrier wall and flanked by paved shoulders. The bituminous expressway was dry and level with a posted speed limit of 113kmph (70 mph). As the road continued south it curved to the right. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire was southbound in lane two traveling at roughly 145kmph (90 mph, as indicated by the EDR). As V1 began negotiating the curve in the roadway it began drifting left. V1 exited the roadway, over the rumble strip, onto the left shoulder. The driver of V1 then tried to get back on the roadway, and steered right. In doing so, the driver overcorrected, sending the vehicle into a slight clockwise rotation, back across the travel lanes. V1 continued across the traffic lanes and contacted an overpass support wall with its front right side. The right side of V1 continued scrapping along the wall for a short distance before changing trajectory again, and traveling back across the travel lanes. The left front of V1 then contacts the concrete traffic barrier on the left side of the roadway. V1 rotated slightly counter-clockwise before coming to final rest against the traffic barrier. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The 19-year-old female driver of V1 stated that she was traveling at close to 20 mph over the posted speed limit, as she traveled to the mall. She stated that she was unable to stay within the lanes while negotiating the curve to the right. She stated that she tried to get back in the lane, but by the time she realized what was going on the vehicle was already out of control.
