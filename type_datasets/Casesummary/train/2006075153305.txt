This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday afternoon. The crash occurred at the four-leg intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The intersection is controlled by 4-way stop signs, and the speed limit is 48 kmph (30 mph) in all directions. Both roadways are two-lane, two-way, straight, level, bituminous roads. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions. There was gravel on the road along the right curb of northbound traffic, but the roadway was otherwise free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound and approaching the intersection with the intention of turning left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Subaru Legacy 4-door sedan, was legally parked along the east curb, just north of the intersection. As V1 turned, V1 lost traction and departed its lane to the right into the parking lane, where the right side of V1 contacted the back-left corner of V2 in a sideswipe motion. V1 veered left, crossed both traffic lanes, and departed the road to the left side. On the left roadside, V1 passed between two small trees; the front of V1 contacted one tree and the right side of V1 contacted the other, brining V1 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1 and 80 kmph for V2.
