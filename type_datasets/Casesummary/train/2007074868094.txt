This two-vehicle, multi-event crash occurred with-in a dark but well-lit downtown intersection a few hours before midnight. The pre-crash roadway is straight, level, two-way, non-divided and bituminous with 3 lanes. The northbound one-way cross street is 2-4 lanes (due to construction), is bituminous and straight with a 4% uphill grade. The intersection is controlled by on-color traffic lights with pedestrian controls, with a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). The road was dry, and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Dodge Magnum wagon driven by a thirty nine (39) year-old male, was traveling northbound in lane 2, being pursued by police. Vehicle two (V2) a 2001 Chevy Cavalier 4-door sedan, driven by a fifty (50) year old female was traveling north in lane 2, a left turn only lane. V1 changed lanes to the left into the on-coming southbound travel lane to pass V2 and make a left at intersection. As V2 also was turning left in the intersection, the front of V1 collided with the left side of V2. The vehicles then side-slapped with V1's right side into V2's left side. The vehicles traveled parallel past the northwest corner of the intersection and up a 9% snow-covered lawn. Approaching final rest, V1's front contacted V2's left front. Both vehicles came to rest about 15 meters (49 feet) north of the intersection. The driver of V1 attempted to flee on foot. After V2 stopped, the driver crawled across the front row to exit the vehicle, forgetting to put it into park. V2 then rolled backwards, coming to rest with the right rear bumper against a small tree. Both vehicles were towed with severe damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Both drivers refused to be interviewed and there were no witnesses, so the majority of the coding has been based on the police report and the researchers on-scene observations.
