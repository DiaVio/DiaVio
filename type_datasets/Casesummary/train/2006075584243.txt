This two-vehicle crash occurred shortly past noon during daylight hours on a dry, left curve, bituminous, divided by a grassy median with a guardrail on both sides interstate. There were four lanes for westbound traffic and four lanes for eastbound traffic. At this point, the right lane for westbound traffic is a merge lane off and on the interstate. The posted speed limit is 105 kmph (65 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Toyota Celica coupe, driven by a 21 year-old male was negotiating a curve on an interstate roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Peterbilt tractor, pulling one trailer driven by a 29 year-old male was on the interstate and had changed lanes from one to two. V1 changed lanes into lane two and started into lane three when the driver lost control. V1 started to rotate counterclockwise and re-entered lane two where V2 was traveling. V1 impacted with its right side to V2's back. V2 then dragged V1 for 66.3 meters (217.5 feet). V1 then became dislodged and came to rest on its wheels in lane one facing northeast. After the impact, V2 drove off the right side of the road onto the shoulder and parked. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 stated he was the lead vehicle of a three-vehicle caravan. He works an average of 46 hours a week and has no problem with this. He usually sleeps six to eight hours a night, but had just woken up after ten hours of sleep and felt rested. He also has the presence of Exlain in his system. He drives this roadway daily and had driven 11 to 14 kilometers (7 to 9 miles) and was on his way to the mall to go shopping with his friends. He was stressed over his car insurance going up because he had gotten some speeding tickets. He was getting ready to sell this vehicle knowing it was the vehicles fault for getting the tickets.
