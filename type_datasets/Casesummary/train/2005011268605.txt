V1, a 1998 Ford Escort, was exiting a commercial drive, southbound, crossing 3 lanes of a 5 lane urban roadway, turning left to go eastbound on that same roadway. V2, a 1998 Ford F-150 pickup truck, was westbound in lane 1 of the same 5 lane, urban, cement, straight, level roadway. At the time of the crash it was daylight and the roadway was dry with a steady traffic flow. V2, front, contacted v1, left. Both vehicles came to rest facing southwest in the center (left turn lane). The driver of v1 was injured, transported, treated and released. V1 was towed due to damage.
