V1 was a 2004 Volvo XC90 (SUV) traveling east on the arterial road when while the driver was talking on the phone V1 departed the right side of the road, struck a culvert/driveway edge with the undercarriage, traveled across the driveway and struck a large tree with the front of the vehicle. The Volvo was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a twenty four year old belted female who was on the phone with her husband at the time of the crash.
