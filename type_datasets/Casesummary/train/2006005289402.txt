This one-vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a two-way, two-lane roadway, which was not physically divided. The bituminous roadway was straight and level and had a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and the roadway was dry. No traffic control devices were associated with this stretch of roadway, and no traffic flow factors were present.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu, was traveling north in lane one of the roadway, intending to continue straight. The right front wheel left the roadway followed by the right rear wheel shortly thereafter. The vehicle then returned to the roadway when it began to yaw in a clockwise direction, entering oncoming traffic. At this point the vehicle came back across the original lane of travel and exited the roadway striking a tree as well as a fence with its left side. The vehicle rotated slightly clockwise before coming to final rest against the tree. The vehicle had to be removed from the scene due to severe damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 42 year-old female, suffered severe injuries including but not limited to broken ribs as a result of the crash, and was airlifted to the hospital for treatment. There were two other occupants in the vehicle at the time of impact, one of which was also taken to the hospital for treatment. After numerous attempts to contact this driver, an interview could not be obtained. For this reason, it is unknown if any fatigue or health related issues contributed to this crash.
