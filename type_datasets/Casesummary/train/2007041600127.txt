This crash occurred on the left (northern) roadside of a two-way residential street, approximately 30 ft. past a four-way intersection. The roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a posted limit of 56kmph (35 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight and level. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis with one occupant, was eastbound in lane two (the westbound travel lane). As V1 continued eastbound at a high rate of speed (it was seen racing another vehicle) the driver lost control and V1 departed the roadway to the left. V1 drove through two chain-link fences, sideswiped a tree and struck a house before coming to final rest in the yard. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a 20-year-old male, was uninjured in the crash. He claimed in his interview that he was driving along when an unknown vehicle ran through the intersection ignoring a stop sign. He tried to maneuver around a vehicle that was in front of him and then lost control traveling off the roadway.
The driver's story was considered unbelievable based on the dynamics of the crash and the account given by a witness. The witness saw V1 driving at a high rate of speed in the wrong lane of traffic with its headlights off. He believed V1 was racing another vehicle. The other vehicle did not stop after the crash and there was no other information obtained for that vehicle. The driver of V1 was cited for the crash for no proof of insurance and careless driving.
