V1 was a 1998 Honda Civic traveling east on the road, passing through the curve when its right wheels departed the right side of the road. V1 then regained the road and crossed partially into the westbound lane before crossing right again and departing the right side of the road again and tripping to roll 2/4 turns to its left coming to rest facing west while overturned in the roadside brush. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by an eighteen-year-old, belted male who was not injured in the crash. He was running a bit late for work that morning and told the researcher that he had leaned to reach his hat in the right side (passengers) door pocket when his vehicle departed the right roadside the 1st time.
