V1, a 1981 Chevrolet Corvette, driven by a 21 year-old male, was traveling eastbound on road when a mechanical problem with the left rear axle caused v1 to begin to go to the left as the rear fishtailed to the right. The driver steered the vehicle to the right to attempt to regain control and v1 left the roadway on the right rotating clockwise. The left front of v1 struck an embankment and v1 continued to rotate and came to rest facing north in the ditch. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was towed from the scene due to damage and the driver was transported to a local trauma center.
