This crash occurred on a Saturday mid-afternoon involving two passenger cars at an intersection with traffic lights. The speed limits for the roadways are 48 kmph (30 mph). The road from east to west is a two-way, 3-lane undivided roadway. The road from north to south is a two-way, 7-lane divided roadway with four southbound travel lanes. The southbound lanes are an "S" curve, and are curved to the left as they approach the intersection with the east-west road. The road surfaces were dry and there were no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Jeep Cherokee was traveling south in the first lane, negotiating the left road curvature as the vehicle approached the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Chrysler Sebring, was traveling west in the second lane. As both vehicles entered the intersection the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. Both vehicles rotated in a southeast direction and the left side of V2 side-slapped with the right side of V1. V2 then continued to rotate clockwise and came to final rest in the southbound #1 lane. After the side-slap V1 continued in a southeast direction, crossed the center median of the roadway and came to rest in the center northbound left-turn lane, facing south. The front airbags of both vehicles deployed during the crash event. The driver of V2 was transported to a medical facility for injuries and released. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
