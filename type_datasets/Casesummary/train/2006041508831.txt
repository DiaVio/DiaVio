The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a divided ten-lane interstate roadway. There were five northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1986 Chevy C10 Silverado pickup truck with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane three. The driver's right front tire tread separated from the tire, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. V1 veered to the right, across two lanes of traffic, before departing the roadway. V1 rotated approximately 30 degrees clockwise, skidding into a chain link fence. The front end of the vehicle dragged the fence while the deceleration caused by the fence partially lifted the rear of V1. V1 began to rotate onto its front left corner while still dragging the fence. While rolling, the top of V1 struck a tree and carried the upper part of it with it toward an embankment that ended at a canal. V1 skidded on its left side for a short distance before striking an embankment. This stopped the momentum of the vehicle. V1 rolled one-quarter turn back to the right, into a canal. V1 came to final rest upright, in the canal. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
V1 was driven by a 27-year old male who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way to his office warehouse from a job site, when he experienced a right front tire blowout. He tried to pump the brakes and steer to the left to avoid losing control of the vehicle, but the truck did not respond. The driver indicated that the steering wheel would not move. The driver said that the vehicle went into an end-over-end roll as soon as the vehicle went off the roadway. He quickly removed his seat belt, climbing out the driver side window, in the event that the vehicle would have continued to take on water.
