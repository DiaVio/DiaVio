A three-vehicle collision occurred in the westbound lanes of an eight-lane freeway, divided by a concrete barrier. There were three through lanes in the westbound direction with an on-ramp merge lane in this interchange area. This was a straight, level, and bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph). It was late in the afternoon on a weekday. The road was wet, the sky was cloudy and it was raining. The traffic flow was heavy due to rush hour traffic.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet Blazer two door with only the driver present, was traveling on a right curve on-ramp in an attempt to merge onto the freeway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Toyota Camry four door with only the driver present, was traveling westbound in lane two of the three through lanes. Vehicle three (V3), a 2006 Subaru Baja four door with only the driver present was traveling westbound in the lane behind V2. V1 was traveling westbound up the on-ramp when it started to lose control and begin to rotate clockwise as it approached the through lanes. The driver in an attempt to correct the vehicle movement overcompensated, and in turn caused V1 to start to rotate counterclockwise. As V1 was rotating counterclockwise it entered the gore and crossed the two westbound lanes of through traffic. V2 contacted the back left side of V1 with its front left end, which caused V2 and V1 to side-slap. As both V1 and V2 were coming to rest V3 contacted V2 in the backend and continued on to contact V1 on the left side at the rear corner. V1 came to rest on all four tires facing southeast with its front end in lane three and its back end in lane two. V2 came to rest on all four tires facing northwest with its front end in lane one and its back end in lane two. And finally V3 came to rest on all four tires facing west in lane two. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
