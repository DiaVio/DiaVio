This two-vehicle collision occurred during light rain on a weekend afternoon. The crash occurred at the intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The speed limit in 56 kmph (35 mph) in all directions, and both roadways are five-lane, two-way, bituminous roads. The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal. The roadway in the area of the crash was free of defects, and the road surface was wet from light rain. Along the northeast curb, the remains of a previous single-vehicle collision were visible from the intersection.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound in the third (left turn only) lane, and was approaching the intersection with the intention of turning left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the first lane, approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V1 entered the intersection on the green phase of the tri-light, the driver saw an ambulance along the northwest curb-line with emergency flashers activated. The ambulance was attending the previous collision. The presence of the ambulance confused the driver of V1, and she executed a left turn as V2 entered the intersection. The front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles deflected northwest to final rest in the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
