The crash occurred at an intersection containing an east/west, 5-lane (3 west and 2 east) road with a raised curb divider and a north/south, 8-lane (4 north and 4 south) road with a raised curb divider. The east/west road on the westbound side had a straight/right turn lane (lane 1), a straight/left turn lane (lane 2) and a left turn only lane (lane 3). The north/south road on the northbound side had a right turn only lane (lane 1), 2 straight through lanes (lanes 2 and 3), and a left turn only lane (lane 4).
