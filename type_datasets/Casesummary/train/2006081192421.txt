As V2 approached the intersection, the driver of V1 pulled into his travel lane. The driver of V2 locked his brakes and skidded across into the inside lane and its front impacted with the left side of V1. On impact, V2 rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees and stopped in the center of the intersection, facing west. V2 was towed due to damage.
