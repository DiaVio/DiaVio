The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a high-occupancy, high volume interstate. There were five northbound lanes with paved emergency shoulders on both sides of the roadway. There were concrete barriers separating the north and southbound roadways. The roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The traffic flow was normal and conditions were clear on weekday afternoon. Vehicle #1 was a 1994 Jeep Cherokee Laredo that was driven by a 24-year old male who had borrowed the vehicle from a friend to run some errands. He was driving along in lane two when he experienced a tire tread separation. This caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, skidding to the left across the third lane of travel. Vehicle #2, a 2002 GMC Envoy, was traveling south in lane three when its driver, a 28-year old male, observed V1 skidding laterally into his lane. The driver of V2 stated in the interview "it all happened so fast there was nothing that I could do to avoid impact." The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. V1 kept rotating counterclockwise, skidding toward the concrete median barrier. The right rear corner of V1 struck the barrier and then V1 came to final rest facing north on the left shoulder.
The police report indicated that the driver of V1 received a citation for an improper lane change but the driver of V1 stated that he had lost control due to the tire blowout/complete tread separation. This loss of control caused him to enter lane three. Investigation of the tire in question revealed that there was a tread separation, confirming the statement of the driver of V1. Both drivers were transported due to injuries and both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
