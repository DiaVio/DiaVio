The crash occurred on a curve in the eastbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The roadway was tree lined with a one-half meter deep ditch along the right side of the eastbound lane. Prior to point of impact, the eastbound lane had a right curve with a radius of 103 meters and a superelevation of 2 percent. Weekday early morning traffic was light at the time with wet roads and rain. Skies were dark at dawn.
V1, a 2001 Ford Escort 4-door sedan, was driven by a 19 year-old female. The driver stated that she had just left home and was traveling to work in the eastbound lane at a rate of 40 mph (64 mph). As she was negotiating the right curve, another vehicle passed her on the left in the westbound lane. After the curve, the other vehicle changed back into the eastbound lane close to her vehicle. Fearing the other vehicle would crash into the left side of her vehicle, she steered to the right over the lane/shoulder line onto the slick, muddy roadside, losing control of her vehicle. Her vehicle went down a low ditch off the right side of the eastbound lane, crashed into a sign located at the bottom of the ditch with the right front corner of V1, causing the rear of V1 spin out clockwise 180 degrees. The left rear portion of V1 then struck a tree. The force of the crash with the tree spun the front of V1 an additional 10 degrees clockwise out of the ditch before coming to rest off the road to the right, facing west. The driver was not injured or transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The officer at the scene stated that the road was hazardous when wet and needed to be grooved.
