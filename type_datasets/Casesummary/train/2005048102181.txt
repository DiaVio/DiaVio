This two-vehicle crash occurred during morning daylight hours on a median divided, dry, bituminous, roadway that runs east to west with three lanes in each direction. The north side of the roadway intersects with a two-lane roadway, two-way that runs north to south and is controlled with a stop sign.
Vehicle one (V1) is a 1995 Mack RD series dump truck without cargo. V1 was southbound at the stop sign attempting to make a left turn and head east. V1 was stopped for one to two seconds and did not see any traffic, then proceeded into the intersection. V1's front made contact with vehicle two's right side. V1 then proceeded into the eastbound lanes and partially pulled onto the median and lane three at final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Toyota Corolla, was westbound in lane three with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). As the driver of V2 approached the intersection he noticed V1 pulling out from the stop sign but he had nowhere to go to avoid the crash. V2 was impacted in the right side and went into a clockwise rotation approximately 180 degrees and came to final rest in lane one of the eastbound lanes.
