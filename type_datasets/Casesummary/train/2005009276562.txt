This crash occurred on the morning of a weekday on the roadside of a two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway was curved with a downhill grade greater than 2%. It had been raining on and off during the day making the roadway wet. There was also construction work occurring on the roadside, which tracked mud onto the roadway.
As V1, a 1998 Chevy Blazer, attempted to negotiate the curves of the road but the driver lost control, causing V1 to begin a clockwise spin and depart the roadway. V1 rode up the embankment and began to rollover. As V1 rolled over it struck a fire hydrant with it left side and finally came to final rest on the roadside on its top. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by an 18 year-old male in good health and on his way to his friend's house. He stated he was traveling at 40kmph (25mph) when the car started to swerve and he attempted to regain control by braking and steering to the left and to the right, but this only caused the vehicle to skid even more and eventually roll over. The driver was transported to a treatment facility with non-incapacitating injuries. V1 was towed due to damage.
