This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a six-lane dark highway divided by a grass median. There were three southbound and three northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, bituminous highway with a posted speed of 89kmph (55 mph). It was in the evening on a weekday and the road was dry with no adverse conditions.
Vehicle 1 was a 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix that was exiting from a local motel onto the southbound lanes of the highway. Vehicle 2 was a 1997 Honda Civic heading south in lane 3. Vehicle 1 turned left onto the highway in an effort to cross over to the northbound lanes. The median prevented V1 from making a clean turn and ended up heading north in lane 3 in order to get over to the crossover. As V1 was making its way to the crossover V1's front contacted V2's front. The driver of V1 then fled the scene and ran into the motel where he had exited from. State Troopers then went door to door of each room and finally apprehended the driver.
