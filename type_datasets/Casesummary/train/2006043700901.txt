The crash began in the westbound lane of a two-way, two-lane roadway. The roadway had a posted speed of 72kmph (45 mph) and the westbound lane was on level ground. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was early afternoon hours on a weekend.
Vehicle one was a 2000 Dodge Caravan minivan traveling west around a left curve. V1 traveled partially off the right side of the road while negotiating the curve. The driver overcorrected to the left and lost control. V1 then departed the roadway a second time off the right roadside. V1 rolled right three-quarter turns onto its left side due to the steep embankment of the roadside terrain. V1 came to rest on its left side off the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1.
The Dodge Caravan was driven by a 36-year old female who was uninjured. She stated she was heading home with her kids when she traveled slightly off the road and lost control of her vehicle. She said she was not completely comfortable with the handling of the minivan since it has a high center of gravity. She estimated her travel and impact speeds to be around 64kmph (40mph). The driver commented that the loose cargo items were tumbling all over the place when the vehicle rolled over. The minivan was towed due to damage.
