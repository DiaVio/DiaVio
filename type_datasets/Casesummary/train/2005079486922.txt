This two-vehicle collision occurred during morning daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway, where the speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) in all directions. The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal with no protected left turn phase. The east-west roadway is sloped slightly downhill for westbound traffic. At the time of the collision, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Toyota Camry four-door sedan, was traveling eastbound in the second lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, bituminous roadway. V1 was stopped at the entrance to the intersection, and awaiting an opportunity to turn left, although the vehicle was stopped in a through-traffic lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Toyota Matrix four-door hatchback, was traveling westbound in the second lane of opposing traffic, approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest in the intersection. V2 deflected right and came to rest near the north curb of the first westbound lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
