The one vehicle crash occurred off the west side of a north/south undivided two-lane roadway. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). It was early afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the weather was clear.
V1, a Chrysler PT Cruiser with the driver as the sole occupant, was traveling northbound. V1 drifted over the left edge of the roadway, made contact with a fire hydrant, the front of bottom step, and a railing before coming to final rest in a driveway. The left front tire was flat; most likely due to contact with the curb, and left tire marks. A witness on-scene stated the vehicle was "coasting 5-10 mph" while the vehicle was on the sidewalk. Police Reported Travel Speed is 11 kmph for V1.
It should be noted the PAR indicated this was the first day of a road closure with limited work started and limited access to vehicles. No work was being performed and there was no limited access to any vehicles during the time of the crash. Traffic on this roadway was light/moderate during this time of day.
The driver of V1, a 55 year-old male, was transported to the hospital for evaluation. The driver is a diabetic who injects insulin three times a day and stated he had not eaten all day. He did not remember anything about the crash except to say that prior to blacking out he started to cough. He had no memory of crash events after that.
