The posted speed limit for this road is 48 kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash it was clear, and there were no adverse weather conditions, sight restrictions or road defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a red 1999 Ford Ranger compact pickup, was northbound behind a non-contact vehicle. Vehicle two (V2), silver 1999 Chevrolet Blazer compact SUV, was northbound, stopped, in front of the non-contact vehicle behind vehicle three. Vehicle three (V3), a white 1993 Mitsubishi Diamante 4 door, was stopped in traffic for a second non-contact vehicle that was stopped waiting to turn left. The first non-contact vehicle, followed by V1, steered to the right into a bicycle lane and passed V2 and V3 in a bike lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The restrained V1 driver, a 51 year old female, noticed the stopped traffic and braked, but was unable to stop before the front of V1 contacted the back of V2. The impact with V1 pushed V2 forward and the front of V2 impacted the back of V3. All three vehicles came to rest near their points of impact on their approximate original headings in their original lane of travel.
The restrained V2 driver, an 18 year old female, was transported to a local trauma center with minor injures. The restrained V3 driver, a 40-year-old male, was not injured. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage; V3 was driven from the crash scene.
