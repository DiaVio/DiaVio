A two vehicle daytime collision occurred on a Thursday just before noon during daylight. The collision occurred in a four-leg intersection with a traffic control signal with pedestrian signal. The pre-crash roadway for V1 is straight with an uphill grade of 3% and V2 is straight and level. Both roadways are paved with bituminous. There is a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) for both vehicles.
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 1993 Volkswagen Jetta sedan, was traveling northbound on the roadway in lane two wanting to go straight through the intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1987 Honda Accord sedan, was traveling eastbound in lane one, also wanting to go straight through the intersection. V1 entered the intersection on the red light. The front of V1 impacted the right side of V2 causing them to deflect north/east. The front of V1 was snagged by V2's right wheel well, causing it to rotate counter clockwise coming to rest facing south. V2 continued east in a c clockwise yaw, both rear tires impacting the curb and coming to final rest with its rear plane against a chain link fence. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
On the other side of the chain link fence was a vehicle, a 2005 Pontiac Grand Am sedan that was legally parked in a car dealer's lot. There was no contact from V2, but the service manager wanted that car to be put on the report in case the owner found a scratch.
