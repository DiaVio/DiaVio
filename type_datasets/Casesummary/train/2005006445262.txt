V1, a 1994 Nissan Quest minivan, was driven by a 36-year old male. V1 was traveling eastbound in the first lane of travel, approaching an intersection. V2, a transit bus, was driven by a 55-year old male. The bus was stopped in the first lane of travel to let off passengers at a posted bus stop sign. V1 came up behind V2 and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2 while V2 was letting off passengers. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1 stated during the interview that he had been talking on a cellular phone with a friend prior to the crash. Immediately before the crash, the driver ended the conversation and looked down to hang up the phone and to place the phone on his lap. When he looked up again, he saw the transit bus (V2) at a complete stop. The driver of V1 stated that there was no way he could have stopped in time and “stomped” on the brakes, but his vehicle slid into the rear of V2.
