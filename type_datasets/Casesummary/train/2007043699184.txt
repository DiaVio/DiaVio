The crash occurred at a three-legged intersection in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, undivided roadway. There was a residential street leading to the south. The roadway had a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) and both the northbound and eastbound approach was on a 4% downhill grade. There was a hillcrest just west of this intersection. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was mid-morning hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 2003 Toyota Camry sedan traveling eastbound in lane one. Vehicle two was a 1997 Ford F150 pickup also traveling east in lane one, but a fair distance behind V1. V1 attempted to use the side street for a U-turn. The driver pulled to the right onto the side street and then began turning left across the roadway into the direction she had come from. The left side of V1 was impacted by the front of V2. Both vehicles traveled off the north roadside. V1 impacted a small bush with its left side before coming to rest against a medium tree it impacted with its front plane. V2 came to rest against a large tree it impacted with its front plane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
The Toyota Camry (V1) was driven by a 72-year old female who was transported to a local hospital with non-incapacitating injuries. She stated that she was going from home to a doctor's appointment. She had gone the wrong route so she decided to turn around. She cannot recall the actual events of the crash beyond attempting to turn around. The Toyota sedan was towed due to damage.
The Ford F150 (V2) was driven by a 25-year old male who was uninjured. He stated that he was heading to work when the vehicle ahead of him attempted a U-turn and pulled across his lane of travel. He steered left and braked without lockup, but could not avoid the collision. He estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 64 kmph (40 mph) and 56 kmph (35 mph), respectively. The Ford pickup was towed due to damage.
