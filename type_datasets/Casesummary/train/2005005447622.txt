The crash occurred on a three-lane undivided roadway with one lane westbound and two lanes eastbound. Conditions were as follows: early afternoon, clear skies, and a completely dry and level roadway. Just prior to the crash location, there was a right curve in the westbound direction. The speed limit was unknown, because it was not on the police report and no signs were found near the crash location.
V1 was 1995 Ford Escort 4-door station wagon driven by a 33-year old female. The driver of V1 was traveling westbound and had just finished negotiating the curve and was nearing a traffic light. For an unknown reason, V1 traveled off the roadway on the right side and struck the guardrail with the right front of the vehicle. V1 then spun in a counterclockwise direction, and struck the guardrail a second time with the left back of the car. The car came to rest against the guardrail, facing in the opposite direction of traffic. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
When the researcher arrived on scene, the driver was there but leaving with a police officer, so there was no interview. One of the remaining police officers on scene was able to provide a brief description of the crash. V1 needed to be towed due to the damage. Although several attempts were made to contact the driver, no interview was obtained.
