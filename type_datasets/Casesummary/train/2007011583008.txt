The crash occurred on a one-way, three-lane, straight, level road with a posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday afternoon crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2006 Chrysler Pacifica 4-door crossover wagon, was driven by a 31 year-old female who left work early to go home because she was nauseous. The driver stated that she was north eastbound on the road and felt that she was going to vomit, so she slowed to pull onto the right shoulder. The driver looked to the front right seat to reach for a bucket with her right hand. As she did so, she vomited. V1 left the road on the right side. The driver tried to brake but stepped on the accelerator instead. The front left of v1 struck a guardrail. V1 continued and the front right struck a chain link fence, knocking it down. Witnesses stated that v1 was in lane two and suddenly crossed to the shoulder and went off of the road on the right sign. A witness stated that the driver braked after striking the fence. The front center of v1 struck a wooden highway signpost (10cm x 10cm), shearing it and pulling it out of the ground. V1 came to final rest off of the road, facing north and was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver refused treatment at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
