Vehicle one was a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am sedan traveling eastbound in lane one. V1 was negotiating a curve to the right when it traveled off the left side of the roadway. V1 continued on the grass shoulder for approximately 100 meters before encountering a group of small trees on the shoulder. The vehicle traveled briefly over the small trees and was subsequently overturned to the right in a climb-over manner. The vehicle came to rest on its top on the shoulder. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The Pontiac Grand Am was driven by a 59-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with non-incapacitating injuries. She was unable to be located for an interview regarding the crash. The investigating officer estimated her travel speed to be 55 mph and her impact speed to be 10 mph. The Grand Am was towed due to damage as a result of coming to rest on its top.
