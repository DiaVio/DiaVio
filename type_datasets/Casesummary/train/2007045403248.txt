The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a grassy median. There were two lanes in each direction. The asphalt roadway was straight, level and dry with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday morning during the rush hour under clear skies. Traffic flow was congested with stop and go activity.
V1, a 2001 Nissan Altima four-door with one occupant, was westbound in lane one. V2, a rebuilt 2003 Honda Accord two-door with one occupant, was westbound in lane one ahead of V1. V3, a 1996 Lincoln Continental four-door with one occupant, was also westbound in lane one ahead of V2. V2 and V3 were stopped due to traffic congestion ahead of them. As V1 approached, it braked with lockup in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid impact. V1's front end struck the rear end of V2 (Event 1), pushing it forward with a slight counter-clockwise rotation. The front right of V2 then struck the back left of V3 (Event 2). All three vehicles stopped facing west in lane one within a meter or two of impact. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage. V3 left the scene before researcher arrival. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
