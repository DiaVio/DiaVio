This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the center of an intersection composed of a 2-lane north/south roadway, and an east/west 2-lane driveway. The east/west driveway was bituminous, with a 3% downhill grade, composed of one lane in each direction and controlled by a stop sign. The north/south roadway was bituminous, with a 3% uphill grade, composed of two northbound lanes and one southbound lane with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow was heavy due to rush hour conditions and the sky was overcast.
V1, a 1998 Honda Passport with one occupant, was stopped facing west preparing to exit the driveway and turn left into the southbound traffic lane. V2, a 2001 Ford Taurus with 1 occupant, was traveling north in left-hand turn lane approaching a traffic light. V1 was waved through a gap in traffic by a Non-Contact Vehicle and began its left turn. As V1 crossed the northbound lanes it struck the right front corner of V2 with its front. Both vehicles came to final rest near the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
