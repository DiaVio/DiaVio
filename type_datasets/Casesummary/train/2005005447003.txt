The crash occurred while (vehicle 1) V1 was heading East on a 2 lane not divided roadway. Conditions were early in the afternoon, partly cloudy skies, and almost completely dry roadway, slightly wet from the melting snow in the middle of the week.

She continued across the driveway running over large bolders and hitting the large cement light post on the south side of the driveway coming to rest up an embackment in the bushes. The minivan went for approximately 20m, after departing the roadway, up a slight embankment. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
