A single vehicle daytime collision occurred in the early afternoon hours on a Friday. The collision occurred heading northeast on a two-way arterial road where it passes under a highway. The road has four lanes of travel, divided by a one-meter wide curb in the center. The pre-crash roadway is concrete paving with an unknown downhill grade and a gradual curve to the right as it levels out. The approximate radius of curvature is 530 meters (1,738 feet), as measured on satellite maps. Access to the roadway is fully controlled, with no junctions in the immediate area of the crash. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 48 Kmph (30 mph).

The left front wheel of V1 rode up the curb in the center of the road, lifting the entire left side of V1. V1 then continued forward on two wheels, and struck a support column in the center of the road. This impact ripped off the left front wheel assembly and shattered the loose rim. V1 then came back to level, without rolling over, and swerved to a stop approximately 200 meters (656 feet) after the impact. The driver was transported to the hospital due to injuries. V1 was towed due to disabling damage, being without a left front wheel. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
