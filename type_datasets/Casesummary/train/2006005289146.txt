This single vehicle crash occurred in the early evening of a weekday on a two-lane, two-way roadway, undivided roadway. The bituminous roadway was straight, with a downhill grade of greater than 2% and a posted speed limit of 64kmph (40 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2000 Acura TL, was southbound in lane one when it departed the roadway to the right. The driver over steered when he attempted to return to the roadway and crossed the lane into oncoming traffic. The driver than overcompensated when steering right briefly returning to his original lane of travel before departing the roadway to the right and striking an embankment. Upon contacting the embankment, the vehicle proceeded to roll about its longitudinal axis, coming to final rest on its roof facing north. The vehicle had to be removed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 38 year-old male who suffered minor cuts and bruises, but did not require transport to a medical facility. The driver claimed that he had looked down for a moment and that is when his car initially left the roadway. He then attempted to correct this by steering to the left. This in turn caused his vehicle to cross the center double yellow lines. To avoid hitting a car traveling in the opposite direction he steered to the right, but overcompensated, causing his vehicle to leave the roadway again, and traverse up an embankment. This caused his vehicle to overturn coming to final rest on its roof facing north.
