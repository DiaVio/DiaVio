This two-vehicle, rear-end crash occurred during daylight hours in the vicinity of a T-intersection. The bituminous two-way roadway was not physically divided. It consisted of two westbound lanes, including a left-only turning lane. There was only one lane heading east. The roadway was straight with a downhill grade for westbound traffic. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) and there were no traffic control devices present at this location. The traffic flow was stopped due to a school bus in the eastbound lane discharging passengers. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Dodge Shadow, was westbound in lane one on the roadway with the intention of going straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, was stopped in lane one for the school bus ahead of V1. V1 failed to stop behind V2 and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest near the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 48-year-old male, suffered non-incapacitating injuries as a result of the crash and was taken to a medical facility for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of this vehicle. It is therefore uncertain if any fatigue or health related factors contributed to this crash.
The driver of V2, a 45 year-old male, was not injured in the crash. A partial interview was conducted with this driver while on-scene. He related that he was stopped in the roadway because a school bus had turned on its lights to let out students. He stated that V1 failed to stop and ran into the back of him.
