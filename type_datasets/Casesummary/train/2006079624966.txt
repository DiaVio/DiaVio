This single-vehicle collision occurred on a weekend night. The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a straight, level stretch of a four-lane, positively divided, concrete expressway. The expressway has no artificial lighting, and the speed limit is 105 kmph (65 mph). A paved shoulder borders the left side of the highway, and a steel guardrail separates northbound traffic from southbound. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the first lane. V1 had been weaving through traffic due to the driver's incapacitation. V1 departed the roadway to the left side, where the front of V1 contacted the guardrail in a sideswipe motion. V1 re-entered the road and crossed all northbound lanes. V1 departed the road to the right side, where the front of V1 impacted a reflector signpost, knocking it down. V1 continued forward and contacted a wooden highway signpost with its front, cracking the post. V1 continued forward and broke through a chain-link security fence. V1 entered a field and came to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
