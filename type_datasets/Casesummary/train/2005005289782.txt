This crash occurred as V1, 1995 Pontiac Transport, was turning right from a curved road to a driveway at a “T” intersection. The crash occurred during daylight hours, and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions when the crash took place. The east/west lanes of the roadway consisted of four lanes, two in each direction. The north/south driveway that V1 was turning in to consisted of three lanes. Two of the lanes were designated for the northbound traffic, and one was for southbound traffic. There was an island dividing the two directions of travel. The posted speed limit for the east/west lanes was 64kph (40mph).
V1 was heading east in the first lane of travel. As the vehicle turned into the driveway, it failed to slow down and veered off of the roadway striking the center median. V1 was than redirected across the roadway over the curb on the right side and through a fence. After contacting the fence, which crossed a bridge, the vehicle proceeded to fall approximately 10-15 feet before coming to final rest in a shallow stream. Both airbags were deployed as a result of the collision. The vehicle had to be towed from the scene due to frontal damage, as well as damage to the undercarriage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 was airlifted to a nearby hospital for evaluation. According to the police, the driver spoke very poor English and did not recollect exactly what happened. Attempts at contacting the driver were not successful.
