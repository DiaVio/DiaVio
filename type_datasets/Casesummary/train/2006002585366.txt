The Ford Taurus (Vehicle 1) was driven by a belted 48-year-old female, who was transported, treated and hospitalized due to injuries. She stated that she was on her way home from work. She was upset because of a physical altercation with a 19-year-old autistic male at work and was thinking about how she could have handled the situation differently. She indicated that she had avoided a squirrel that ran out in the roadway, but remembers nothing after that until after she hit the pole. She stated she was in fair health and wears bifocals for myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (far-sighed) conditions. She takes medications for emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a heart defect.
