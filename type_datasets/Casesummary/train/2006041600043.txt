Vehicle 1 was a 1998 Oldsmobile Delta 88 that was driven by an 84-year old male who was on his way to a doctor's appointment. He was traveling in lane two heading eastbound. He stated in the interview that he had the green light and green arrow and decided to make a left turn. He did not realize that it was an illegal maneuver to make a left turn across three lanes of traffic.
