This single vehicle crash took place during the evening hours of a weekend on two-way, two lane, undivided roadway. The bituminous roadway was level with a curve to the left and a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50mph). There was an advisory speed of 72kmph (45 mph) within the curve itself. The roadway was wet from the rain that had been falling all day.
V1, a 1998 Toyota Camry, was westbound in lane one approaching a curve left. As V1 entered the curve it began to depart the roadway to the right. V1 than returned to the roadway where it began to rotate counter clockwise. V1 traveled across the roadway, while still rotating before departing the roadway to the left. V1 then contacted a pole with its left plane before coming to final rest on the left shoulder. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 22 year-old male who was treated on-scene for non-incapacitating injuries. He stated that although he slowed for the curve, he began to depart the roadway to the right. He attempted to steer left and apply more brake, but began an uncontrolled spin that sent him into the pole. V1 was towed due to damage.
