This crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway with center rumble strips. This was a left curve, uphill, bituminous roadway with a speed limit of 40 KMPH (25 MPH). It was early afternoon on a weekend and the road was dry and skies were clear at the time. Atmospheric conditions were rapidly changing from sunny and clear to dark clouds with intense snowfall reducing visibility to less than half of a mile for short periods of time; however, there was no accumulation of snow on roadway or roadside surfaces. Traffic flow was light.
V1, a 1996 Toyota Tacoma pickup with two occupants, was traveling southbound. V2, a 1999 Isuzu Amigo sport utility vehicle was legally parked on the side of the road unoccupied. Prior to driving, the driver of V1 had been ice-skating and fell, striking his head and back on the ice. A short while later the driver stated he was not feeling well and decided to go home. En route home, the driver began to lose consciousness and in doing so drove off the right side of the roadway. As V1 drove off the roadway, the right side mirror struck the left side mirror of V2, the Isuzu Amigo. V1 then began to traverse down the hillside, striking five trees before coming to rest against the fifth tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1, the Toyota Tacoma, was driven by a 39 year-old male who was originally transported with an unknown injury due to being unconscious and slumped over the passenger seat. The driver was pronounced dead at the hospital.
