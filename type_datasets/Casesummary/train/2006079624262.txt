As V1 was traveling, it rotated clockwise traveling towards the north curb. The back plane of V1 contacted the north curb. The rear plane of vehicle one then contacted a small tree located north of the north curb. V1 came to rest facing southeast against the tree and partially on the sidewalk. V1 received moderate damage and was towed from the scene. The driver fled the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1 is an unknown male. The unidentified driver fled the scene after the collision.
