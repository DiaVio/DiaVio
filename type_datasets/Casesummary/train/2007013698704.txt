This crash occurred off the right side of an undivided two-lane asphalt highway without a positive divider and a posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph). The crash occurred during daylight hours, and there were no adverse conditions present at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt 4-door, was traveling eastbound in the right lane. The driver of V1 steered hard to avoid a non-contact vehicle encroaching into her lane from the left and lost control of her vehicle. V1 skidded in a clockwise rotation off the roadway with its left side leading. The left side tires of V1 dug into the soft ground and V1 then rolled three quarter turns to its left. It then rolled back one-quarter turn onto its roof. Before the last quarter turn, V1 rotated so that the front of V1 was facing in the opposite direction at final rest. The driver of V1 was treated on the scene with minor injuries, and the vehicle was towed with moderate damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 54 year-old female, stated that there were two vehicles in the left lane next to her traveling about the same speed as her. She said that the second vehicle behind the first was flashing its lights, honking its horn, and tailgating the vehicle in front of it. The first vehicle in the second lane hit its brakes, and the following vehicle swerved into V1's lane to avoid a crash with the vehicle in front of it. The driver of V1 stated that she steered hard to the right to avoid coming into contact with the other vehicle and she then lost control of her vehicle and departed the roadway to the right and rolled over.
