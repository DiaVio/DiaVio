V1, a 1996 Newflyer Bus was traveling eastbound on a two lane, one way, dry asphalt roadway in daylight conditions. V1 approached the intersection and was intending to go straight. V2 a 2003 Ford Explorer was traveling southbound on a four lane, one way, dry, asphalt roadway in the same conditions. V2 approached the same intersection also intending to go straight. V1 reported that he stopped for the stop sign but could not see V2 due to trees in the way of his sightline. V2 thought that V1 would stop and yield the right-of-way.
