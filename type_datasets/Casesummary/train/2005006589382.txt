The driver of V2, a 45-year old female, was conversing with her passenger and said that she saw V1 come out from the intersecting street at the last minute and steered her vehicle left attempting to avoid the crash, however, it wasn't enough time to prevent the collision. The driver of V2 was transported to the hospital with minor injuries. Both vehicles were towed due to damages.
*The PAR says that it's a 1998, Toyota Prius, however, I ran it through Vin Assist, which gave a 2004 manufacture date.
