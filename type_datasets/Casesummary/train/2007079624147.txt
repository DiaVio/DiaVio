This single vehicle collision occurred just before midnight on a dark but lighted four-lane north/south state highway. The pre-crash area includes a three-lane interchange that connects an interstate highway with the state highway. The number three lane of the interchange leads to a deceleration lane for an off-ramp. The state highway adds a car pool lane at this location. The car pool lane is separated by painted solid yellow lines. The north/south highway is dry, concrete, curves left, and has an unknown upgrade slope. The southbound lanes are separated by a concrete center divider. An asphalt gore point exists between the off-ramp and the state highway's four lanes. An asphalt shoulder borders the west edge of the highway. West of the west shoulder exists a raised asphalt curb that separates a dirt and brush area from the highway. A diamond-shaped orange sign on the gore point area warns of highway construction south of the crash location. An overhead sign indicates the function of the car pool lane. The highway is designated a 104 kmph (65 mph) zone.
