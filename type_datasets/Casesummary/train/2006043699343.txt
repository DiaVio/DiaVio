The crash occurred in the morning of a weekend in the eastbound lanes of a two-lane, rural roadway. The east/west roadway consisted of one lane in each direction and featured a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The roadway was bituminous and dry with the eastbound lane having a 4% downhill grade and curving to the left. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Kia Spectra, was negotiating the curve as it traveled west. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Ford F150 pickup, was negotiating the curve as it traveled east. V1 began drifting across the double yellow center lane line and entered the eastbound travel lane. The left side of V1 struck the left side of V2 as they passed one another. Both vehicles continued forward, departing the road to the south. The front of V1 struck a medium sized tree before coming to final rest against the tree. The right side of V2 struck a small tree before coming to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
