This two-vehicle crash occurred mid after-noon during day-light hours at a driveway on a two-lane east/west road.. The east and westbound travel lanes were divided by a painted median and are straight, level and of bituminous construction. The east/west roadway has a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear, traffic was not congested, and there were no sight restrictions or road defects.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 1991 Nissan Sentra 2 door, was southbound entering the roadway from the private drive intending to turn left and go eastbound. Vehicle two (V 2), a 1993 Ford Aerostar van, was westbound in lane one of the roadway. The front of V 2 collided with the left side of V 1 in the westbound lane. The impact pushed V 1 a short distance to the west and it came to rest facing generally south/southwest in the westbound lane. The impact with V 1 caused V 2 to rotate somewhat counterclockwise and V 2 came to rest a short distance beyond the point of impact in the original lane of travel facing generally southwest. V 1 was towed due to damage; V 2 was driven from the crash scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
