This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon hours in the middle of a T-intersection. The north/south roadway upon which vehicle one (V1) was traveling consisted of two undivided lanes. The east/west roadway upon which vehicle two (V2) was traveling also consisted of two undivided lanes. The grade for V1 was an uphill grade of more than 2 percent; however, the grade for V2 was level. The posted speed limit for both V1 and V2 was 56 kmph (35 mph). The only traffic control device associated with this crash was a stop sign present for V1. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and the roadway was dry.
V1, a 2002 Suzuki XL-7 sport utility vehicle, was traveling north approaching the T-intersection. V2, a 1986 Chevrolet S10 pickup, was traveling east. As V2 neared the intersection, V1 attempted a left turn. Although the driver of V2 braked and steered left, the front of V2 contacted the left front side of V1. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise slightly to the east before coming to uncontrolled final rest in the eastbound lane. V2 veered in a northeasterly direction coming to an uncontrolled final rest across the eastbound and westbound lanes. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
