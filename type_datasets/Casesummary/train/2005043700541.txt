The crash occurred in the north roadside of a two-way, two-lane, rural road. The westbound direction had a 3% downhill grade around a left curve with +10% superelevation. Posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph), though the curve was marked with arrow warning signs indicating it was sharp. Conditions were dark and dry with cloudy skies. The setting was the mid-evening hours of a weeknight.
Vehicle one was a 1994 Buick LeSabre sedan traveling west negotiating the left curve. V1 braked with lockup and traveled off the right side of the roadway, striking a curve warning sign with its right plane. V1 continued off the right roadside, striking a medium size tree with its right plane. V1 came to rest after striking a small tree with its front plane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 59-year old male who was transported to a local hospital with possible injuries. He stated that he was negotiating this curve at a speed of approximately 40-48 kmph (25-30 mph). He braked and the wheels locked, causing the vehicle to travel off the right roadside. He estimated his impact speed to be 32-40 kmph (20-25 mph). The sedan was not towed due to police-reported damage, but was removed from the scene by a local wrecker service.
