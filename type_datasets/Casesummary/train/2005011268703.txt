The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a limited access urban highway, which was divided by a concrete median barrier wall. The straight and level bituminous roadway had a posted speed limit of 113kmh (70 mph). Conditions were dry and sunny on the weekday afternoon.
V1, a 2002 Pontiac Aztek, driven by a 25 year-old female, was traveling eastbound in lane three at approximately 70mph. V1 activated her right turn signal and changed lanes to lane two. The driver of v1 immediately saw a non-contact vehicle in lane one moving into lane two. The driver of v1 swerved and over corrected to the left to avoid the vehicle, moving into lane three, and was headed to the left shoulder. V1 then swerved to the right and realized the vehicle was heading back towards lane two. The driver swerved left one more time and lost control of the vehicle. V1 rotated counterclockwise and left the road on the left side. V1 crossed the paved shoulder and the front of v1 struck the concrete median wall. V1 bounced off of the wall, rotated counterclockwise and came to a stop on the shoulder facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
