This crash occurred on a weekend morning on the left side of two-way, three-lane, undivided, urban roadway. The roadway consisted of two southbound lanes and one northbound lane; and featured a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). The bituminous roadway is level and curves slightly in the right as one travels north. At the time of the crash the roadway was still wet from earlier rain. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV, was northbound negotiating the curve right. As V1 negotiated the curve it left its lane, crossed the two southbound lanes, and impacted the curb. V1 continued off-road as it went through a chain-link fence and up an embankment before impacting a tree where it came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
V1 was driven by a 21-year-old male, who was commuting to a neighboring town. According to the driver the vehicle “kicked,” and began to fishtail on the wet road. He attempted to steady the vehicle, but was unable to regain control. Because of the wet roads there were no skid marks that could corroborate this claim. The driver was uninjured but V1 was towed due to damage.
