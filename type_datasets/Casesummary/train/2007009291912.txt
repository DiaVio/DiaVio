The crash occurred on a two-lane two-way undivided roadway in the westbound lane. There was a 4% downhill slope in the westbound direction. The crash occurred on the left curved section of the S curved roadway. The posted speed was 48 kmph (30 mph) with a posted advisory speed of 40 kmph (25 mph) during the weekday in the very early evening commuting hours.
V1, a 1998 Kia Sephia/LS four-door sedan was driven by a 47 year-old female traveling with a 37 year-old niece. The driver stated that they had left her daughters home five minutes prior to the crash, traveling west at a rate of 40 kmph (25 mph). As V1 approached a left curve with a 4% downhill slope, she braked to slow her vehicle. Unfortunately, the brake pedal went to the floor without resistance. Without brakes, V1 picked-up speed down the slope while both occupants panicked. The two occupants frantically discussed ways to stop the car, first the driver used the hand brake without success, next she turned off the ignition and lastly, she jammed the vehicle into park, causing the steering wheel to lock. With the steering wheel locked, V1 traveled for 7 meters to the right before going off the road, crashing into a tree with the front right portion of V1. The driver said that V1's brakes were replaced two months prior to the crash. Both occupants were transported for injuries, although the passenger's injuries resulted from jumping out of the vehicle prior to the crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The passenger confirms the driver's statement adding that when the driver first attempted braking V1 was traveling 48 kmph (30 mph). Prior to the crash, her aunt told her to jump out of the vehicle before jumping out of the vehicle herself.
There was a 7-meter liquid trail leading to the final rest but no skid marks at the scene. When the researcher checked the vehicle's brake pedal the following day, it had resistance, however it is possible that the brakes failed.
