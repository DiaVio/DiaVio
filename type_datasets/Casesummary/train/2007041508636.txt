Case #2007-143
The crash occurred at the intersection of two roadways. The north/south roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street. The east/west roadway was a two-way, three-lane undivided street. The east/west traffic way was controlled by a stop sign. Posted speed in all directions was 48 kmph (30 mph). Conditions were dark with streetlights on a weekday evening. The roads were dry, with clear skies. Traffic flow was normal. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
V1, a 2006 Mitsubishi Endeavor with two occupants, was traveling eastbound in lane one. V2, a 1998 Acura 3.0CL with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the two vehicles entered the intersection, the right side of V1 made contact with the front of V2. V2 was towed due to damage.
The Mitsubishi Endeavor was driven by a 21-year old female, who was not injured. She stated on-scene that she approached the intersection and looked both ways before proceeding. The driver claimed that the other motorist came flying out of nowhere, implying that the other driver was speeding. There was no evidence to support this claim. The driver became uncooperative at the crash scene, declining to be interviewed.
The Acura CL was driven by a 44-year old female, who was treated on-scene for her injuries. According to the driver, she was on her way from her house to the store for a quick errand. The driver said that as she approached the intersection, a vehicle crossed in front of her from left to right. The lead vehicle was being followed by another vehicle, V1. Apparently, V1 did not stop at the stop sign before proceeding into the intersection. The driver of V2 said that she braked as hard as she could, but could not stop her vehicle in time.
