Case Summary #2007-43-122
This single-vehicle crash happened in the afternoon of a weekend on an intrastate highway. The three-lane divided highway is flat, straight and the speed limit is 105 kmph (65 mph). The concrete east-west roadway was dry while the weather conditions were clear and daylight. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
V1, a 2004 Nissan Frontier king cab with one occupant, was eastbound in lane three when its left rear tire failed causing this vehicle to spin clockwise. V1 drove off the right side of the roadway and into a steel w-beam guardrail with its front (event #1). V1 continued to spin clockwise and struck the guardrail again, this time with its left side (event #2). Following the second impact, V1 continued to travel eastbound while spinning clockwise and came to final rest on the right shoulder against the guardrail (event #3). The driver was transported to a local trauma center for minor injuries and his truck was towed due to disabling damage.
The driver of V1 is a 27-year-old male that had a few errands to take of this afternoon. His first task today was to buy a new tire for his 2004 Nissan pickup truck since he ran over a nail with his left rear tire the day before and the tire could not be plugged. His second errand was to drop off a key at a co-worker's house. After visiting a flea market, where he purchased a new (used) tire and replaced the old one, he began to drive to his co-worker's house. While driving east in lane three of this divided highway, the newly purchased used tire blew-out, which caused this driver to lose control of his truck. This driver tried to regain control of his truck by braking and steering to the right and left, but his truck spun across all three lanes and departed the right roadside where it crashed into the steel guardrail. This driver said he never checked the tire pressure in his tires and was not aware that two other tires were below the recommended tire pressure.
