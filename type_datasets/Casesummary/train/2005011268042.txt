V1, a 1995 Ford F250 pick-up truck pulling a horse trailer, was traveling eastbound on an undivided two-lane straight and level roadway. V2, a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix, was traveling on the same road in front of V1. At the time of the crash it was clear and dry in the early afternoon hours. The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph). The driver of V2, a 54-year old female, began to slow in response to backed-up traffic ahead of her that was waiting to turn left onto an intersecting street. The driver of V1, a 35-year old male, was traveling approximately 19 feet behind V2, and was looking out of his right side window at a store. When the driver of V1 looked forward again at the road ahead, V2 was almost stopped in front of him. The driver of V1 attempted to brake and steer to the right, but stated that the vehicle did not seem to respond. The front of V1 struck the back of V2, overriding the rear bumper. The trailer towed by V1 was fully loaded with 112 bags of pine shavings that did not shift during the crash. The total weight of the cargo was 2,000 lbs. V1 and V2 both came to a stop on the shoulder of the road facing east. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage.
