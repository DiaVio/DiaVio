This two-vehicle crash occurred in the late morning hours. The primary roadway was a two-lane, undivided, bituminous arterial with paved shoulders that intersected at the crash location with a private driveway. It was daylight and raining. There were no obstructions and traffic was light. The speed limit for both vehicles was 40 kmph, or 25 mph.
Vehicle one, (V1) a black 1999 Volkswagen Golf four door hatch back, was traveling westbound approaching a right curve with a positive grade. Vehicle two (V2), a white 1997 Freightliner W700 Step-van (package delivery truck), was exiting a driveway north of the roadway. The driver of V2 stated he looked left, right and then left again before starting his turn, but did not see vehicle one approaching westbound. The driver of V2 swung the vehicle wide to its left in order to make the sharp right turn he was attempting to make. As V1 approached a driveway on the right, V2 pulled out in front of V1 while attempting to turn right onto the primary roadway. The driver of V2 braked and tried to steer left, but was unable to avoid an impact. The right front bumper of V2 struck the right side front of V2 twice. After these two impacts V1 was redirected off the roadway via the left/south shoulder. V1 struck a sign post located off the roadway with its left front corner and stopped on impact. V1 was towed due to damage. On impact V2 stopped, then it was driven eastbound to the south shoulder where the driver made a controlled stop. V2 was driven away from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
