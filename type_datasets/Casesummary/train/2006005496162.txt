This two-vehicle crash occurred in the late evening hours in the middle of a T-intersection. The east/west roadway upon which vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) were traveling consisted of two undivided lanes, with the westbound direction also having a left turn-only lane. The north/south roadway that V1 was attempting to turn onto when this crash occurred was an undivided two-lane roadway that ended at the east/west roadway. Westbound traffic had a downhill grade of 3 percent, while the grade for eastbound traffic was level. The posted speed limit for V1 and V2 was 56 kmph (35 mph). The T-intersection was controlled by traffic signals all around. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at time of the crash and the roadways were dry.
V1, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was traveling west approaching the T-intersection. V2, a 1999 Ford F250 pickup, was traveling east. As V1 attempted a left turn at the intersection, the front of V2 contacted the right front side of V1. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to rest in the eastbound lanes. V2 came to an uncontrolled final rest facing eastbound in the center of the roadway. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
