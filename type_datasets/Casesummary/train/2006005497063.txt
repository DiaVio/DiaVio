The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a center concrete median barrier. There were two southbound and two northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). It was early evening on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. The traffic flow was in a rush hour mode, with stop-and-go activity.
Vehicle one (V1), an unknown make and year passenger vehicle, with an unknown number of passengers, was traveling southbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), 1993 Toyota Camry 4-door with two occupants, was traveling in lane one. As V1 passed V2 and attempted to enter lane one, its right rear quarter panel struck the left front fender of V2. After impact, V1 continued southbound in lane one without stopping (V1 was a hit and run vehicle). The driver of V2 lost control after the impact with V1 and skidded to the left where it struck the center concrete median barrier with its left front. This impact redirected V2 to the right and it skidded across both lanes of travel and struck the guardrail with its right front corner area. V2 came to an uncontrolled final rest on the west shoulder facing south. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
