This single-vehicle crash occurred in the morning of weekday holiday on a 2-lane undivided roadway at a location where the road curves to the left. The bituminous north/south roadway featured a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The conditions were foggy and dark this morning with a rainstorm approaching.
V1, a 2006 Mazda 6S with one occupant, was southbound when it departed the right side of the roadway. The driver of V1 overcorrected, re-entered the roadway and departed the left side of the road where it struck two small trees (6 cm in diameter) with its front. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 32-year-old female, was returning home this holiday morning after dropping of her children at their grandmother's home. The driver claimed that she was traveling about 40 mph when a "big deer" ran into the roadway and she swerved to miss it. However, the vehicle's trajectory does not support her statement about avoiding an animal. Scene evidence indicated that the vehicle initially departed the right roadside edge at a shallow angle (i.e., lane drift) and the driver appeared to have overcompensated to the left, resulting in a left side roadway departure, traversing the adjacent grass shoulder area and impacting two small trees.
The driver denied that she was tired or distracted when the crash happened and that she drives on this road everyday. She was driving a rental car because her car had been salvaged after she was involved in a crash eight weeks earlier.
