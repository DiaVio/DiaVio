Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Nissan Frontier pickup, was northbound entering a left hand curve. V1 drifted off the right road edge then steered left and across the northbound travel lane into the southbound lane where it steered right and began to rotate clockwise. V1 rotated clockwise off the right road edge where it hit a drain embankment then tripped and rolled 2 quarter turns coming to rest on its roof heading in a southerly direction. The driver was transported to a local hospital were she was admitted. V1 was towed for disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.
The driver a seventy (70) year-old female stated that she had the front windows partially opened and had reached over to the passenger door to roll the window up. As she was rolling the glazing up, she looked up and saw that her vehicle was off the right road edge and heading for a sign. She steered hard left to avoid the sign and over compensated sending her vehicle across the northbound lane. After crossing the centerline she steered hard right and began to rotate clockwise. After leaving the roadway the driver could not remember much other than coming to rest upside down.
The driver was in the process of rolling up the passenger window while driving. Inadequate surveillance, panic, overcompensation and poor directional control, were associative factors.
