This single-vehicle crash occurred on a six lane divided roadway. The roadway consisted of three through lanes in the north and southbound directions. This roadway was level, and slightly curved to the left with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The sky was cloudy with snow and the roadway was covered with slush and ice. The crash occurred during early afternoon daylight hours with little traffic congestion.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Dodge Durango with only the driver present, was northbound in lane two. V1 started to lose control and rotate counterclockwise. In an attempt to avoid a collision with the center median the driver steered left and right to avoid the impact. The avoidance action caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise. While V1 was rotating clockwise it entered lane one and then departed the roadway where it began to rollover. V1 rolled four-quarter times while impacting a fence during the rollover. V1 rolled over an approximate distance of 19 meters (62 feet). V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a twenty-nine-year-old male, was on his way to work from home when the crash occurred. He stated being rested, drives this roadway weekly and is very comfortable with the vehicle. The driver is in good health and does not take any medication. He does, however, need to wear contacts, which were in at the time of the cash. The investigating officer indicated that the driver was traveling below the posted speed limit going 72 kmph (45 mph) when control of the vehicle was lost.
