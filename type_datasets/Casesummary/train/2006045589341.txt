Case #2006-45-007
The crash occurred on an east/west urban interstate. It had two lanes in each direction divided by a concrete barrier wall. The straight, level interstate also had a right shoulder and depressed rumble strips on both sides of the road. Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday with a posted speed limit of 113kph (70mph). Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Vehicle #1 was a 1996 Lexus ES300 traveling westbound in the left (2nd) lane. The driver apparently abruptly changed lanes to the right and lost control. In an attempt to regain control the driver steered left going into a counterclockwise yaw. The vehicle departed the left side of the road and struck the center barrier wall with its front right. The vehicle continued the counterclockwise rotation and struck the wall again with its right back corner. The Lexus (V1) rotated 180 degrees more and eventually came to rest facing west in the left lane. It was towed due to damage.
Vehicle #1 was driven by an 18-year old male that was belted with deployed frontal airbags. He was not injured in the collision. He stated that a driver 'flipped him off' for going too slow in the 2nd lane, which was the foundation for his decision to change lanes. The vehicle began to 'fishtail' as he changed lanes to the right and he steered left in an attempt to regain control before departing the left side of the road and striking the wall. He reported his speed to be around 113kph (70mph). Police charged the driver with failure to maintain control and an improper tag.
