This crash occurred in an intersection of an undivided four-lane roadway and a private driveway. There were two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. There was also a four-way intersection controlled by a stoplight just to the south of the point-of-impact. The roadway was straight, had a down slope of 1 percent south, and was bituminous. It was dusk with no adverse atmospheric conditions, and traffic was moderate. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).
V1 was a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer driven by a 23-year-old male. The vehicle was traveling south in lane one at an apparent high rate of speed. V1 crossed into the second lane in front of another vehicle, apparently so quickly that this vehicle needed to brake very hard. V1 then made a sharp left hand turn into a gas station in front of V2, which was traveling in the curb lane. V1 then struck V2 in the front. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
