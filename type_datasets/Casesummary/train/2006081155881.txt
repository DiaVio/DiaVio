A single-vehicle collision occurred a few hours before mid-night during dark hours. The collision occurred on a rural two-way, two-lane undivided roadway, off the right side of the roadway. The pre-crash roadway is a slight downhill grade, and straight with bituminous paving. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Ford F-250 4x4 Super Cab pickup, was traveling northbound in lane one. Vehicle one departed the roadway via the right shoulder, and the front of V1 impacted a large power pole, shearing it at the base, and dropping the pole and power lines to the ground. V1 continued forward and came to rest 38 meters (125 feet) north of the pole impact in the woods facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1 is an unknown aged male whose pre-crash factors are unknown. He was not on-scene when the researcher arrived at the crash site and could not be located for an interview after many attempts. The vehicle was inspected and no defects were noted from the inspection. The shallow roadway departure angle and post impact trajectory is suggestive of a person who had fallen asleep or had taken their eyes off the roadway. There was no avoidance actions taken to avoid the pole and the vehicle was driven straight after the pole impact into some woods.
