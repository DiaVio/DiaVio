The crash occurred on a high occupancy, high volume, and high-speed interstate. There were five lanes running northbound with emergency paved shoulders on both the right and left sides. The conditions were dry and clear on a weekend afternoon. The posted speed was 105 kmph (65mph). The crash actually occurred off the roadway to the right in the grassy embankment. The embankment featured a downhill grade greater than 2%.
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 2006 Ford F-150 truck, was traveling northbound in lane two when he decided to make a lane change to the left (into lane three). As V1 changed lanes the driver noticed a phantom vehicle occupied the lane he was attempting to change into. The driver then tried to cut back into lane 2 but there was another vehicle changing into lane 2 at the same time. He then hit the brakes and the truck lost control as he veered off the roadway to the right. V1 continued to skid on the soft grassy shoulder until his left side tires dug in the soft ground causing the vehicle to roll left. V1 rolled four-quarter turns before coming to final rest on its wheels on top of a drainage culvert. V1 was towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, an 18-year-old male, stated in his interview he was trying to avoid hitting any vehicle as he changed lanes. He stated that as he attempted the initial lane change into lane three he noticed a vehicle in his blind spot. He then steered back to the right into lane 2 when he saw a minivan attempting to change into that same lane. At this point he then slammed his brakes to avoid a crash and his truck started to fish tail and lose control to the right. He traveled off the right hand side of the roadway and when his truck made contact with the uneven, grassy roadside his vehicle rolled over and continued on until his truck tripped over the cement bride causing the truck to stop rolling. The driver was uninjured.
