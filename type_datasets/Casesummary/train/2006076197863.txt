This single-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a three-lane not physically divided asphalt roadway. The single westbound lane curved right on a 5% downgrade and the two eastbound lanes curve left on a 5% upgrade. The posted speed limit in the area is 104 kmph (65 mph) and the posted advisory speed for the curve is 88 kmph (55 mph). There is a warning sign for curves present at the pre-crash location. The crash occurred during daylight during a heavy monsoon-type rainstorm.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero 4 door sedan, was westbound negotiating a right hand curve when it began to slide to the outside of the curve on the wet roadway. The driver steered right and applied the brakes. The vehicle rotated clockwise as it crossed all travel lanes and with its left side plane impacted the metal guardrail on the eastbound side. V1 came to rest in a dirt pullout farther down the road on the left side. The vehicle was towed from the scene and one of the 4 occupants was transported to a medical facility where she was treated and released. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 57-year-old female, was traveling from her residence to visit relatives in another town with 3 other occupants. She stated she had traveled 113 kilometers (70 miles) when the crash occurred and is familiar with the roadway. The rain had started suddenly and she was slowing down attempting to find a spot to pull over just prior to the crash. The officer in charge stated that all other vehicles on the roadway had pulled off to the side of the road because the rain was extremely heavy and visibility was very poor. He had stopped on the side of the road until the rain slowed and estimated the driver of V1's speed to be approximately 72 kmph (45 mph). During the interview the driver estimated her speed to be between 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph). Three of the vehicle's four tires were underinflated from the manufacturer's recommended tire pressure.
