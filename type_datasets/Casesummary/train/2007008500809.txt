This crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway curved to the left, had a slight uphill grade, was bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (40 mph). It was dawn on a weekday, and the roadway was covered in black ice.
V1 was a 2005 Toyota Tundra, driven by a 51 year-old male. V1 was traveling westbound, behind a garbage truck and three other light vehicles. The driver of V1 crossed the double yellow line on the left side and passed the other vehicles. After passing the other vehicles the vehicle lost traction on the black ice. The vehicle briefly crossed the left side fog line, the driver than steered hard right. V1 began rotating clockwise, crossed both lanes of travel and departed the roadway on the right side, where it struck a utility pole. After striking the pole V1 continued rotating clockwise around the pole, tripped over its wheels and became airborne. The left rear of the vehicle impacted the embankment, and the right front bumper contacted the roadway, leaving a large gouge. The vehicle then bounced twice on the ground and came to final rest on its right side. During the rollover the driver, who was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected through the driver's side window, and landed on the roadway. The driver was transported from the scene via life flight. Police Reported Travel Speed is 137 kmph for V1.
