The crash occurred at the intersection of two roadways. Each leg of the intersection was a two-way, two-lane undivided street. The east/west roadway was controlled by a stop sign. The posted speed in all directions was 48 kmph (30 mph). These were straight, level, asphalt roads. Conditions were daylight on a weekend afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2001 Nissan Altima with two occupants, was traveling southbound in lane one, approaching the intersection. Before reaching the intersection, the driver veered off the right side of the roadway. The front of V1 struck a small palm tree. V1 continued traveling southbound from the right roadside. As V1 crossed the intersection, the undercarriage of V1 made contact with the sidewalk, leaving gouges. The front of V1 then made contact with a fire hydrant. The front left corner of V1 then made contact with the front left corner of a parked and unoccupied pickup truck. This caused both vehicles to rollover. The parked vehicle rolled onto its right side. V1 rolled two quarter turns to the right, ending up on its rooftop, approximately eight meters from the initiation of the rollover. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The Nissan Altima was driven by a 20-year old female, who was injured but refused treatment. She stated that she and her boyfriend were on their way home from a music festival. Though initially accusing the boyfriend of driving, the female occupant later said that she was driving at the time of the crash. On-scene, the driver indicated that she and her boyfriend had been drinking alcohol throughout the day at the festival. According to the driver, there was a dip in the road that caused her to lose control of the vehicle. The researcher found no evidence of any such roadway deficiency.
