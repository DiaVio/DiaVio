Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Dodge Durango, was westbound, following a truck towing a boat trailer and boat. The driver of V1 was looking at a parked vehicle on the left side of the road when the truck driver braked for an animal in the roadway. The driver of V1 realized that the truck was stopping and she steered right and applied the brakes. V1 skidded off the right side of the road and rotated clockwise. The vehicle then rolled over to the left two quarter-turns before coming to rest on its top facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a forty-four-year-old female, stated she was wondering why the vehicle was parked on the side of the road. She was traveling to work from her residence and drives this road daily. She was well rested at the time of the crash. She takes medications for a sore right arm but stated she had not used them within the last twenty-four hours. She has owned this vehicle for a year and has always felt uncomfortable with the way it handles, stating it feels "squirrelly" and that a rollover was bound to happen. Prior to purchasing this SUV, she had driven only passenger cars and trucks.
