The crash occurred on a north/south rural two-lane US highway. The level road had a very slight curve to the east with a radius of curvature of 750m. 2003 traffic counts indicate the road averages carrying 7800 vehicles per day at a posted speed of 80kmph (50mph). Conditions were dry at dusk on a weekend.
Vehicle #1 was a 1991 Toyota MR2 traveling north on the highway. It was following a motorcycle at a high rate of speed; witnesses stated the two appeared to be racing. Vehicle #1 and the motorcycle encountered a slower moving northbound pickup truck and were forced to take evasive actions. The motorcycle avoided the truck by going into the oncoming lane where it narrowly missed being struck head on by a non-contact vehicle. Vehicle #1 evaded the truck by braking and steering to the right, departing the right side of the road. The Toyota (V1) entered a ditch with a -48% grade and struck a mailbox with its front. Its right front wheel dug into the ditch as it intersected a private drive and the vehicle began to roll right. As the vehicle rolled two-quarter turns it also contacted a mile marker sign with its left side. Vehicle #1 came to rest on its top just off the east side of the road facing southwest 27m north of initial roadway departure. None of the other vehicles made contact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
Vehicle #1 was driven by a 38-year-old male that was belted with deployed frontal airbag. He suffered minor cuts and bruises but was not transported to a hospital. He estimated his speed prior to the critical event around 113kmph (70mph). The driver had been drinking alcohol prior to the crash, but police didn't administer a field sobriety or blood alcohol test. In the researchers opinion the driver would have been over the legal limit had a BAC test been administered. Police did not charge the driver with any violations.
