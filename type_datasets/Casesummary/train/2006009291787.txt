The crash occurred off the road of an interstate on-ramp that was curved to the right. The interstate was straight and level with four lanes in each direction, divided by a guardrail. The posted speed on the interstate was 89 kmph (55 mph); the on-ramp had no posted speed limit. This was a bituminous, wet roadway. It was early afternoon on a weekend. It was raining out and traffic flow was moderate on this busy, well-traveled roadway.
V1, a 1998 Jaguar XJ8 four-door sedan, was driven by a 47-year old female. The driver of V1 was negotiating the curve of the northbound on-ramp at an unknown speed when she lost control on the ramp. She tried to restore stability by steering left but was unsuccessful. V1 crossed over the right shoulder and then skidded off the road on the right, knocking down a light pole and continuing into a guardrail before coming to rest on the roadside, facing north. The driver was not injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that she had traveled about 3 miles from church on her way home and was attempting to put on her lap and shoulder belt while steering with her knees when V1 began to veer right. She grabbed the steering wheel with both hands, attempting to correct the direction of V1 by steering left without braking, but was unsuccessful. She stated that weather was an associated factor.
The researcher located skid marks that appeared to belong to V1. These skid marks were on the shoulder of the roadway, continuing off-road, close to the point of impact with the light pole. There was an embankment right of the shoulder that directed V1 into a straight path towards the light pole and guardrail.
