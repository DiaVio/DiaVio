The crash occurred in the northbound lanes on a level bituminous 4 lane divided roadway (two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes) with a posted speed limit of 105 KPH (65 mph). The roadway was divided by a grass median with a positive barrier. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was dark and unlighted at the time of this weekday evening crash. Traffic flow was normal for that time of day.
V1, a 1999 Volkswagen Beetle, was traveling northbound in the driving lane behind a tractor-trailer. V1 changed lanes to pass the tractor-trailer. A non-contact vehicle was traveling in the passing lane as V1 changed lanes to the left. V1 braked and steered right. V1 began to rotate clockwise across the driving lane and off the right side of the roadway. V1 continued to rotate, down an embankment and began to roll to the left. V1 rolled over three quarter turns, struck a 75 cm common based tree with its front and came to rest on its right side facing in an easterly direction. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The Volkswagen Beetle (V1) was driven by a belted 21-year-old male who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from his ex-girlfriend's house and had driven about 5 miles. He rarely drove this roadway and thought that it had three lanes. He had been following a tractor-trailer and attempted to pass it by going into what he thought was the "center" lane. He saw a car in the left lane coming up from behind him as he changed lanes to the left. He then realized that there were only two lanes and thought he would be struck by the other vehicle. He braked and steered right, which caused him to lose control and depart the roadway.
