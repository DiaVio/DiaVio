This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday afternoon. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a six-lane, east-west, positively divided, bituminous expressway. The speed limit in the area of the crash is 105 kmph (65 mph), and the left-most lane is reserved for high occupancy vehicles. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects. Traffic forward of the collision area was congested.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Cadillac SLS 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound in the fifth lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Lexus SC300 2-door coupe, was ahead of V1 in the same lane. Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Toyota Tundra extended-cab pickup was behind V1 in the same lane. Vehicle four (V4), a 2004 Ford F-250 4X2 super-cab pickup, was ahead of V2 in the same lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
Traffic slowed suddenly, and V1 veered left to avoid colliding with the back of V2. The front of V1 impacted the back of V2 in a sideswipe motion. The front of V3 then impacted the back of V1 in a sideswipe motion. V3 continued forward and struck the back of V2. V2 moved forward and impacted the back of V4.
The 29-year-old unlicensed male driver of V3 has six years of driving experience, and has received no driver's training. He and his passenger were listening to the radio. The driver stated that he was two car-lengths behind V1. When traffic suddenly slowed, he applied the brakes, but was unable to avoid a collision. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. This driver was following too closely because he did not realize caution was required. He made a false assumption and assumed that forward traffic would continue to proceed.
