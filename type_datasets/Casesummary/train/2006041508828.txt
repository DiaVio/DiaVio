This crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, twelve-lane interstate roadway, which was physically divided by a concrete traffic barrier. There were six northbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with clear skies and normal traffic flow.
V1, a 2006 Chevy Impala with one occupant, was northbound in lane five. V2, a 2003 Infinity FX35 sport utility vehicle with one occupant, was northbound in lane four, behind V1. The driver of V1 encroached into V2's travel lane. The front left of V2 made contact with the back right of V1. After impact, the two vehicles stayed on the roadway, rotating several times before coming to final rest. The two vehicles came to final rest in lane three, facing south, approximately 30 meters from each other. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1 and 97 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 33-year old female, was transported to the hospital due to non-incapacitating injuries. She initially stated that she was on her way from her house to a friend's house. The driver's attire, coupled with her state of mind and the early time of the crash, indicated otherwise. She later admitted that she had come from a nightclub. The driver indicated that she was traveling at a speed of around 48 kmph (30 mph) on the interstate, when she suddenly noticed that she was approaching her exit. The driver said she began to move to the right in order to make her exit, and was hit from behind.
The driver of V2, a 43-year old male, was transported to the hospital due to non-incapacitating injuries. He declined to be interviewed, pending litigation.
