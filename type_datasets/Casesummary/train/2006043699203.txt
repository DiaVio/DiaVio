The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a four-lane, divided roadway with a grass median. There were four westbound lanes on an interstate highway with full traffic control. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph) and the westbound lanes had a downhill grade of 2%. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was mid-afternoon hours on a weekday.
Vehicle one was a 1996 Nissan Altima sedan traveling westbound in lane one. An unknown vehicle (V2) was traveling behind V1 at higher speed. The rear of V1 was impacted by the front of V2. V2 continued on without stopping. V1 departed the roadway on the right side. V1 impacted two medium sized trees in the north roadside with its right plane. These trees created a ramp-like effect, causing V1 to roll one quarter turn onto its right side. V1 came to rest in this position, and was later turned right side up by emergency personnel. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
The Nissan Altima (V1) was driven by a 20-year old female who was transported to a local hospital with non-incapacitating injuries. She was unable to be located for an interview. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 104 kmph (65 mph). The Nissan sedan was towed due to damage.
