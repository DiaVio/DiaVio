This single-vehicle crash occurred on a four-lane divided roadway. There are two lanes in each direction separated by a raised median. This roadway curves to the left, with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours; the roadway was wet and slushy from a recent heavy snowfall.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Ford Explorer with one occupant, was westbound in lane one at a police reported speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). The driver of V1 started to lose control on the slushy roadway while negotiating a left curve. The driver steered right and began to pump the brakes to try to slow down and regain control. This caused V1 to begin a clockwise rotation. V1 departed the roadway on the right and struck a tree with its left side. V1 then rotated counterclockwise around the tree and lightly struck a bench with its left front corner as it came to rest, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to moderate left side damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a twenty-two-year-old female, had just come from a friend's house and was going home to change clothes for work. She rarely drives on this roadway and said she is unfamiliar with driving in the snow and ice since she recently moved here from a warmer climate. She denied being in a hurry, but had to be at work in less than half an hour from the time of the crash. She takes no medications and was well rested.
