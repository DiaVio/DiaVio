The crash occurred on a stretch of eastbound interstate that was straight with a positive grade measuring 2.8%. The interstate had four lanes. Concrete barrier walls bordered both the north and the south paved shoulders of eastbound lanes. The speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph) on a weekday evening around dusk.
V1 was a 1997 Subaru Impreza-Outback that was traveling eastbound in lane three on the interstate when it changed lanes to its left into lane four in an attempt to pass a non-contact vehicle that was originally traveling ahead of V1 in lane three. Once V1 was in lane four and had almost overtaken the NC- (noncontact) vehicle, the NC vehicle moved into lane four and V1 steered hard to the left while braking heavily in avoidance. V1 then began to skid counterclockwise and struck the left/north wall with its front. It then continued east and came to rest facing northeast mostly in lane three but with the front left corner in lane four. V1 was first dragged from final rest to the right/south shoulder by a state DOT help truck for safety then towed from the scene later. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 20 year-old-female whose airbags did deploy and was uninjured in the crash. She was on her way to the bookstore from work at the time of the crash. She did admit to drinking coffee with her left hand at the time of the crash.
