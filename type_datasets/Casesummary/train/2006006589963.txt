This two-vehicle crash occurred in the late morning of a weekday in the middle of a four-way intersection. The intersection consisted of a two-lane north/south cobblestone roadway featuring two sets of metal trolley tracks planted in cement running along the center of the roadway and a bituminous two-lane east/west roadway controlled by properly functioning traffic signals. The roadways for both directions were dry and level and each featured a posted speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1996 Ford Ranger Pick up, was southbound on the cobblestone roadway approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V2, a 1993 Mazda MX3 was eastbound approaching the same intersection where it also intended to go straight. As V1 entered the intersection against the red light it struck the left of V2 with its front. After the impact, V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest still facing southward. V2 rotated slightly counter-clockwise and came to final rest still facing southeast. Vehicle two was towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 66-year old male, was driving to his next job site and admitted to looking at his log book as he approached the intersection. He figured the light changed as he was looking down. He applied his brakes but it was too late. He was not injured and drove his vehicle from the scene.
The driver of V2, a 42-year old female, stated she was eastbound approaching the intersection and saw that the light was green and continued to proceed. She was just about in the middle when she was struck by V1. She was listening to the radio and talking with her passenger at the time of the crash. She saw V1 approaching her, but could not avoid it. She travels on this roadway daily and is familiar with he roadway.
