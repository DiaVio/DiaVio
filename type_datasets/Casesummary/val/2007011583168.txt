The single vehicle, weekend, early afternoon crash occurred off the right side of a straight, level, east-west, undivided 2-lane, rural, bituminous roadway. At the time of the crash it was daylight, clear, and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit was 80 kmph (50 mph).
V1, a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan occupied by an 80 year-old male driver and a 72 year-old female passenger, was westbound in lane 1 of the roadway described above. V1 drifted off the roadway to the right and struck a mailbox with its front. V1 then re-entered the roadway and drifted across the centerline into the eastbound lane, drifted back to the right into the westbound lane and then exited the roadway to the right again. V1's front struck another mailbox, continued west off the road to the right and stuck a small tree with its front right. It continued forward and then struck 2 trees >10 cm with its front. V1 came to rest against the tree facing west-northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver, who died 2 days later from his injuries, told his daughter (who was later interviewed) that his blood sugar was low the morning of the crash. She asked him not to go anywhere or if he did, to not take her mother along (the passenger in the crash). He decided to go anyway and went to his grandson's ballgame then was on his way to his son's house when the crash occurred. He doesn't remember much about the crash as he started "blacking out" as he was westbound at about 45 mph. After drifting off the road to the right, he tried to regain control and get back on the road but could not keep the car under control.
