This crash occurred on a 7-lane roadway near an intersection. There were four eastbound lanes and three westbound lanes, divided by a grass median. The roadway curved to the left slightly and had a downhill slope of two percent. The road was bituminous with a speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). It was the mid-afternoon on a weekend and traffic flow was light.
V1, a 2000 Honda Accord four-door sedan, was driven by a 64-year old female who was traveling with her pet dog in the car. V1 was behind V2, which was stationary at the intersection waiting for the traffic signal to turn green. V1 failed to stop when she approached the intersection and the front of V1 struck a trailer that V2 was towing, which pushed the trailer into the rear of V2. The driver of V1 stated that she was on her way to pick up her son from jail when the crash occurred. She stated that her dog was whining and she was comforting him and that's when she had taken her eyes off the road and struck V2 in the rear. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 was a 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche 4-door pickup that had a cargo trailer hitched to the rear. V2 was driven by a 43-year old male who was riding with a 42-year old male passenger. V2 was stationary at the light waiting for the signal to turn green. He said he saw V1 approaching him from the rear at a constant velocity through his rear view mirror. He said he could see that she wasn't going to stop so he just braced and was struck. A driver from another vehicle who was in front of V2 heard the crash and exited her car to see what happened. She said the driver of V1 was incoherent and acting strangely. She said the woman walked over to her and was trying to hug her and asking her if she was ok. She said the driver of V1 smelled of alcohol. She also stated that the driver told her that she had been drinking Vodka and Tonic and that she had taken Oxycontin because she was in pain. She said she avoided the woman since she had a cut on her hand, which was probably from being in the crash. Another witness had stated that he saw V1 a couple minutes before the crash driving in between lanes and driving erratically. Upon arrival, State Troopers conducted tests to see if the driver was intoxicated. The driver failed the tests and was arrested on scene. The driver was worried about her dog and what was going to happen to him. She became belligerent and had to be hog-tied in the vehicle.
The witness vehicle that was stopped in front of V3 was put on the police report because she remained at the scene and police initially believed that V2 was pushed into her vehicle. She stressed to the researcher that she was not involved in the crash even though it was listed on the PAR. She exited her vehicle after she heard the crash and kept the dog that belonged to the driver of V1 calm.
