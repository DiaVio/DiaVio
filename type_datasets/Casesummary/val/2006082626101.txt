This late evening three-vehicle crash occurred on a two-way, undivided, asphalt dry, three-lane roadway on a bridge. The eastbound lane is downhill and curves to the right. The westbound traffic consists of two lanes that are uphill and curve to the left. There are jersey barriers on both sides of this roadway. The speed limit on this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). It was dark, but lighted and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of this crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Nissan 240 SX, was traveling east in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Audi A4, was traveling west in lane two. Vehicle three (V3), a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer, was eastbound in lane one in front of V1. V1 was traveling at an unreasonable high speed and crossed over the center lane line. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid a collision by braking and steering right, but the left side of V1 struck the left side of V2. V2 continued westbound and came to rest in the lane one. V1 crossed back to the right and the front struck the right side jersey barrier. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and began to roll over to the right. The driver of V3 saw V1 in the rearview mirror and accelerated to avoid a collision, but the right side of V1 struck the back of V3. V1 rolled over to the right two quarter-turns and continued to slide eastbound. V1 came to rest on its top facing north and was towed due to damage. V3 came to rest in the eastbound lane facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a nineteen-year-old male, refused to be interviewed. The driver of V2, a twenty-two-year-old male, was traveling from his girlfriend's home to his home. He was familiar with his vehicle and the roadway. Although it was late in the evening, he was alert and reacted to the movement of V1 as expected. The driver of V3, a twenty-four-year-old female, was driving a twenty-three-year-old male friend from a bar to his home. She was fatigued due to the late evening hour, but was comfortable with the roadway and her vehicle.
