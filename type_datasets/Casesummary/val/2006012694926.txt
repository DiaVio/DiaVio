This crash occurred at an intersection of an undivided two-way 2-lane roadway and a one-way 2-lane roadway. The intersection was controlled by 4-way stop signs. Both roadways were level, dry asphalt and the posted speed was 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash occurred in the early evening while still daylight on a weekday.
Vehicle #1 was a 1986 GMC Jimmy that was traveling west on the two-way roadway. Vehicle #2 was a 1998 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was traveling south on the one-way roadway in the second lane of travel. As the driver of V2 came to the intersection, he stopped for the sign. The driver stated that he noted a non-contact vehicle approaching from the west, so he waited for it to come to a complete stop. The driver of V2 intended to make a left turn at the intersection. Meanwhile, V1 approached the intersection from the east. The driver of the non-contact vehicle waved V2 on. As the driver of V2 started his left turn, he noted V1 approaching. He thought that V1 was going to stop. However, V1 entered the intersection without stopping and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2. This impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise to come to final rest facing north. V1 came to final rest at the east side of the intersection facing west. The drivers of V1 and V2 were not injured. V2 was towed due to damage. V1 was drivable. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
