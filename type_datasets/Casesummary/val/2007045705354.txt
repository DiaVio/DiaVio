The crash occurred on an urban one-way road that was straight and level and was bordered on either side by delineated parking spaces. The crash occurred less than 20 meters north of an intersecting primary arterial road that ran east/west and had four undivided lanes. The arterial was a two-way road. The intersection was controlled by traffic signals on colors with pedestrian signals. The arterial was also straight and level with a speed limit of 56kmph/35mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were mid evening, dark, and dry on a weeknight. The roadway was illuminated by streetlamps.

The driver turned right/north onto the one-way road and lost consciousness. V1 then traveled to the left side of the one-way road and its front struck V2, a 1998 Mercury Sable 4-door sedan that was parked on the left roadside in a parking space with no driver present.
