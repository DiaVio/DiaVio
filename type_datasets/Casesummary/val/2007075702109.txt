This two-vehicle crash occurred in a four-leg, traffic signal-controlled intersection. On the east leg of the intersection, the roadway is divided by a curbed median and the westbound traffic lanes consist of a right-turn lane, three through lanes, and a left-turn lane. This roadway is straight, level, and has a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). On the north leg of the intersection, the roadway is divided by a curbed median and the southbound traffic lanes consist of a right-turn lane, two through lanes, and two left-turn lanes. This roadway is straight, uphill in the southbound direction, and has a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). This crash occurred in the early morning on a weekday with rush hour congestion.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Dodge Ram 1500 extended cab pickup with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane four, approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee with one occupant, was stopped at the intersection, southbound in lane five, the inside left-turn lane. The traffic signal indicated a green arrow for southbound traffic, and V2 proceeded into the intersection. V1 proceeded into the intersection at the same time. The driver of V1 applied the brakes, but the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V1's tires left 24 meters (79 feet) of pre-impact skid marks. At impact, V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest facing west-southwest in the middle of the intersection. V2 rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing south-southeast in the middle of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a forty-three-year-old male, was driving from his home and going to work while listening to the radio. He explained that he simply didn't see that the light was red and felt that the sun shining directly into the light from behind him made it difficult to determine whether the light was green or red. He was well rested, very comfortable with his vehicle, and drives this route several times a month. He is in good health and takes no medications. Based on the length of the pre-impact skid marks (with good brakes) he was traveling at or slightly above the posted speed limit. V1 was equipped with rear ABS only, the front wheels locked up creating the skid marks (e.g., solid & straight non-pulsing type skid marks).
The driver of V2, a thirty-seven-year-old female, had just left the grocery store and was on her way home. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle, and drives this route daily. She is in good health and takes no medications. She was listening to the radio and assumed that the driver of V1 was going to yield her the right of way since she had the green light. After she heard the brakes squealing and that V1 was coming right at her she unsuccessfully attempted to avoid the crash by accelerating, but it was too late..
