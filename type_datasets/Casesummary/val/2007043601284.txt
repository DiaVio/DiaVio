This single vehicle crash occurred in the evening of a weekend on a 4-lane highway in a rural area. The highway ran east and west with two lanes for each direction, a grass median dividing the roads, and a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). Near the location of this crash, there was a slight curve to the right with a downhill slope of 2 percent. The conditions were clear, dry, and dark without any roadway lighting.
V1, a 1993 Chrysler Town & Country minivan with one occupant, was eastbound in lane two exiting the small curve in the road when it veered off the left side of the road. V1's driver steered back onto the roadway but over steered into lane one and lost control of her vehicle as she tried to correct its course. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise and departed the roadway on the left side. V1 entered the grass median with its right side leading and struck a sign (event #1) before it flipped two-quarter times (event #2) and came to final rest on its top. V1's driver was not injured in the crash but her vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 was a 42-year-old female that reported to being in good health and has not taken any medication in the past two weeks. She also said she felt well rested the day of the crash; however, she could not recall what time she last went to sleep or how many hours she slept. For this trip, she said she was at a bar for one hour and drank two beers before she decided to visit her friend who lived an estimated seven miles away. After stopping at a gas station, she traveled east in lane two when a phantom vehicle, traveling through a crossover, turned into her lane. She alleged that she swerved right to avoid the phantom vehicle, lost control of her minivan, and began to fishtail. She drove off the left side of the roadway and into the grass median where her minivan rolled over onto its rooftop.
