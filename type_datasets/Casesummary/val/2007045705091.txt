There was an uninvolved right side off ramp and three westbound through lanes that were curved to the left (south) with a radius of 1029 meters and was super-elevated to 4.8%. There was also a precrash grade measuring +5.3%. The highway was asphalt until heading westbound where a bridge begins and the pavement was concrete on the bridge. The north side of the bridge also had a concrete wall. Both sides of the interstate had paved shoulders with no rumble-strips in the crash area. Conditions at the time of the crash were dusk on a weekday evening in a downpour with water running across the interstate (from south to north/left to right). The speed limit was 89kph/55mph.
