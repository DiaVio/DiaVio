This crash occurred in the middle of the afternoon on a clear day. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Dodge Caravan, was traveling east on a 5 lane undivided roadway in the third lane and was turning left to go north. As V1 turned left onto a cross street, the driver lost control and drove off the roadway on the west side of the street, into and over a fence and off a retaining wall and came to rest with the front and undercarriage of V1 in a parking lot; the rear wheels remained on top of the retaining wall. The parking lot is well below street level, so when V1 drove through the fence and over the retaining wall, the front/undercarriage of V1 contacted the ground/pavement of the parking lot surface. V1 final rest was at a down angle of approximately 45 degrees. The driver of V1 received minor injuries from the crash; mostly due to the fact that he was a paraplegic and was out of place in the driver's seat when the crash occurred. Rescue personnel removed the driver from the vehicle. V1 was towed from the scene and the driver was transported to the hospital with minor injuries. Both frontal airbags deployed. The posted speed limit on the roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph).
The driver of V1, a 61 year old male, is a paraplegic who operates his own vehicle with adapted hand controls. The driver rolls himself into the drivers seating area and locks in the wheel chair to prepare to drive. The wheel chair represents the driver's seat and is flat and quite wide and is made for comfort while sitting, not necessarily driving. The driver of this vehicle also had a screw on knob on the steering wheel that assists his steering. At the time of the crash the knob was loose, and possibly contributed to the crash. It appears that the driver, while making a left turn, grabbed the knob to make the turn and the knob shifted on the wheel. This shift put the driver out of place in the seat and he lost steering control of the vehicle. The vehicle continued to go forward in the turn, into the fence, and over and down the retaining wall with the front and undercarriage of the vehicle in contact with the ground/pavement of the parking lot. The driver has been driving for 45 years, is familiar with the vehicle and drives the route daily. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
