This three-vehicle crash occurred on a straight, divided, uphill roadway. The roadway runs north and south at the location of the crash and consists of three through lanes and one left turn lane in each direction. The speed limit on the highway is 64 kmph (40 mph) and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time. The crash occurred at night, but it was lighted. There was heavy traffic on the roadway at the time.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Corolla, was southbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was southbound in front of V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Mazda 6, was southbound in front of V2. A non-contact vehicle stopped and V2 and V3 stopped in traffic. The front of V1 struck the back of V2. V2 moved forward and the front struck the back of V3. All three vehicles came to rest just south of the area of impact. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a forty-nine-year-old female, was well rested, traveling a familiar route and was comfortable with her vehicle. She admitted (through a translator) that she "wasn't paying attention to the car in front of her."
The driver of V2, a nineteen-year-old female, refused an interview. It is unknown if she was aware of V1 prior to the crash.
The driver of V3, a twenty-six-year-old female, was not fatigued and was comfortable with her route and vehicle. She was watching the traffic in the right lanes so that she could change lanes to the right but her lack of attention to V1 and V2 did not contribute to this crash.
