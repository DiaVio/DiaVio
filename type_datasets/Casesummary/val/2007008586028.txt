This crash occurred on a two-lane undivided east/west roadway. In the eastbound direction, the roadway curved to the right and was level. In the westbound direction, the roadway was straight and uphill, before beginning a curve to the left. The roadway was recently repaved with asphalt. Lane delineations were marked by small, double yellow lines that were spaced very far apart. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and conditions were clear.
V1 was a 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier 4-door sedan, driven by a 62 year-old female. V2 was a 2000 Mack dump truck that was towing a flatbed trailer. The heavy truck was carrying no cargo at the time of the crash. V1 was traveling westbound and V2 was traveling eastbound. As V2 negotiated the right curve, V1 crossed over the left lane line where it struck V2 head on in V2's lane. V2's driver saw V1 cross into his lane and locked up his brakes, coming to a full stop just prior to impact. V1 collided with V2's left front tire and bounced backwards approximately 7 meters, returning to its original travel lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
