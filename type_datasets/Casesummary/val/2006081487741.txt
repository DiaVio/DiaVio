Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Mercury Cougar, was stopped facing eastbound in lane three, preparing to turn left and head northbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Audi A4 Quattro 4-door, was traveling westbound in lane two, the right lane of the two forward lanes. V1 stopped at the traffic signal, then on a red light, turned left and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 that was westbound and had a green light. At impact, V2 rotated counter-clockwise and traveled off the right side of the roadway and came to rest facing southeast on the right sidewalk. V2 came to rest in the intersection facing southwest.

The driver of V1 was a 22 year-old male who is reportedly in good overall health. He has no hearing or vision restrictions, and he does experience work related stress that he doesn't know how to explain, mostly just that he works too much, he has two different jobs. He was a little fatigued from interrupted sleep, and an argument with his brother around 4 or 5 am. His brother called from Mexico and he was in trouble and needed money to get out of trouble, they had argued about this a little, as he is sick and tired of his brother asking him for money. He had slept at his friend's house on the floor. He was heading home from his friends house, and he was not in a hurry. He was distracted by his phone ringing; it was his mother from Mexico. He stopped at the light, and when the light turned green for the other two forward lanes, he was confused and proceeded when his light was red, he did not realize this.
The driver of V2 was a 25 year-old male whose pre-crash factors are unknown, as he was not interviewed.
