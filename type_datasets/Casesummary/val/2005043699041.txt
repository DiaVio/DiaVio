This two-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon on a 5-lane undivided roadway in a suburban part of town. The roadway was an east/west road with a center left-turn lane for both directions. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) and weather conditions were clear and sunny. The road was flat and straight with several public access lots along the westbound travel way and near the location of the crash.
V1, a 2000 Pontiac Firebird with one occupant, was exiting a parking lot while attempting to turn left into the eastbound lanes. V2, a 1999 Isuzu Rodeo with one occupant was traveling west in lane 3. Once V1 entered the roadway and slowly made a left turn, it was struck on the left side by the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest at the point of impact. Neither of the drivers suffered any injuries but they were both examined on the scene by EMS. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by 39-year old male driver who was an unemployed disabled veteran. He was leaving a gas station parking lot when he was involved in this crash. He reported that he was stopped at the parking lot exit/entrance way with his left turn signal on when he was "waived clear" by a vehicle's driver that was stopped in lane 2. Once he entered the roadway and began to turn left, V2 (Isuzu) drove into the left side of his Pontiac. He believes the Isuzu's driver was speeding around the stopped traffic so she could catch a green light at a nearby traffic signal. This driver reports he did not see the Isuzu until they collided and therefore was unable to avoid the crash. He was not injured in the crash but his car was towed due to damage.
The driver of V1 reported that he was on his way to a store to look at a gift for his wife when this crash occurred. He stated that he had been injured in the Army during a parachute exercise several years ago. He suffered a gunshot wound to his left leg and a severed nerve in his back. Other than those injuries, he reported that he was in reasonably fair health with good vision and will occasionally eat a BC Powder (aspirin) pill.
V2 was operated by a 29-year old female that was traveling west in lane 3 of a 5-lane undivided roadway when V1 turned across her path. The front of her vehicle struck the left side of V1 and came to rest upon impact. This driver said she never saw V1 pull out of the gas station because there was traffic backed up in the first two lanes to her right. The driver of V2 intended to turn left at the signalized intersection several meters up ahead.
This driver was headed to the Department of Motor Vehicles to straighten out an issue she had with the department regarding her recently purchased Isuzu. She reported that she owned two businesses and averaged 12 hours of work per day. She worked 15 days in a row since her last day off and a total of 70 hours in the past 7 days. She reported that she slept a regular 6-hour sleep schedule and felt rested every morning. She was in good health and the only medication she took was a minor tranquilizer.
