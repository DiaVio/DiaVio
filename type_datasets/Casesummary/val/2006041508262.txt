This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday in the middle of an urban “T” intersection. The intersection consisted of an east/west seven lane divided roadway and a north/south seven lane divided roadway (that terminated at the intersection) controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. The north end of the intersection served as an entrance for a tire store. Both roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level with posted speed limits of 72kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2003 Honda Accord, was eastbound in lane four approaching the intersection where it intended to turn left into the tire store. V2, a 2005 BMW 530I, was westbound in lane two approaching the same intersection where it intended to go straight. The traffic light was solid green for both eastbound and westbound traffic. As V1 attempted its left turn it was struck on the right side by the front of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
V1 was driven by a 26-year old male, who refused treatment and could not be reached for interview. However, in his statement to police, the driver indicated that as he approached the intersection he turned left on a solid green light, assuming that the other driver should have yielded the right of way.
