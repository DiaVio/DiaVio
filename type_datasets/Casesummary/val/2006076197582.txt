This single-vehicle crash occurred on a 2-lane asphalt roadway that was under construction. The temporary detour roadway curved sharply to the left just before the area of impact for eastbound traffic and signs were posted stating road construction. The roadway is level. Barrels blocked off the new road under construction and barricades with flashing light lined both sides of the road as well as the center dividing the 2 lanes. Concrete barriers lined the right side of the eastbound lane. The posted speed limit for this section of the road is 40 kph (25 mph). The speed limit sign was posted just prior to the active construction zone. The crash occurred on a weeknight with no lighting except for the flashing lights of the barricades.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Chrysler LeBaron 2-door convertible with the top up and carrying 4 occupants, was eastbound in the construction zone and making the sharp left curve when the vehicle left the traffic lane to the right, entered the shoulder where the front right bumper contacted one of the barricades. V1 continued forward where the front right bumper contacted the concrete barrier wall. V1 then contacted the concrete barrier again with its right side plane and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing south. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 24-year-old female, stated she and her friends were visiting at the residence of another friend. She was on her way to take the friends home then to go home herself. She stated she was traveling at about 56 to 64 kph (35 to 40 mph) going around a curve when she hit one of the signs. She stated she then hit the wall and stayed to the right to avoid oncoming vehicles. She stated she was probably going too fast. The driver and her friends had been to the funeral of another friend earlier in the day and had spent the afternoon and evening together. The circumstances surrounding the friend's death were disturbing and traumatic for the driver. She has two young children to care for and has been looking for employment as well. The driver was fatigued and rarely sleeps continuously because of an infant and a toddler to care for. The driver drives the route weekly and is familiar with the vehicle.
