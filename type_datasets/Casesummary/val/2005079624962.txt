This single-vehicle collision occurred during morning daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred on a slight right hand curve of a dry, level, positively divided, five-lane, concrete expressway. The speed limit on this roadway is 105 kmph (65 mph). At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet HHR four-door wagon, was traveling westbound in the second lane, about to change lanes to the left. A non-contact vehicle slightly behind V1 in the fourth lane was, at the same time, changing lanes to the right into the third lane. As V1 made its lane change, the driver noticed the non-contact vehicle entering the same space and veered hard right to avoid a collision. V1 lost traction and rotated clockwise as it crossed the westbound lanes and departed the road over the right road edge. On the roadside, the left wheels of V1 impacted the raised curb, causing V1 to roll left-to-top onto a steep uphill embankment. V1 slid down the embankment and back onto the roadway, where it came to rest on its roof in the first lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
