The crash occurred in the middle of an offset four-way intersection. The east/west road has five lanes; two eastbound lanes, two westbound lanes and a center two-way left turn lane. The north/south roadway has two lanes; lane one is for southbound traffic and lane two is for northbound traffic. The north/south roadway is controlled by a stop sign. The conditions were dry and clear on a weekday afternoon. The roadway was straight and level. The posted speed was 72 KPH (35 MPH).
V1 was a 2005 Hyundai XG350 that was stopped at the north/south roadway waiting to pass through the intersection to the southbound roadway. The driver proceeds into the intersection and hits the right side of V2, a 1987 Toyota Tercel that was traveling westbound in lane two. The Toyota then gets pushed sideways into the southwest curb and continues off the roadway till V2 drives up a wire rope/pole and getting about four feet off the road then making final rest facing southbound in lane one in the east/west roadway. After V2 hits the wire/pole it bounces off the bumper of V3, a 1996 Jaguar that is stopped in lane one of the east/west roadway who had stopped as she witnessed the crash between V1 and V2. No one was injured and V1 and V2 were towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1 was driven by a 72-year-old male who was on his way home from the grocery store. He approached the stop sign and was stopped for about a "minute" when he stated that he looked both ways then went and "bam hit the red car". He stated that he did not see the red car in lane two. The driver of V1 was cited for the crash for failure to yield right of way at a stop sign. He was unable to try to avoid the crash, as he did not see V2 till right before impact. An associative factor for this driver was the overgrown tree somewhat blocking the view of the intersection roadway (see crash scene pictures).
V2 was traveling westbound in lane two on his way to a local casino. The driver was an 89 year-old male. The driver was going about 40 kmph (25 mph) when he was just hit on the right side panel. He was then sent sideways into the curb and off the roadway. He was not able to try to avoid the crash, as he did not see V1 until he felt the side impact. He was not injured but his vehicle was towed due to damages. During his interview he stated that he does take medication but would not say what specific medication he was on daily. There were no associative factors related to this driver.
V3 was driven by a 44-year-old woman who was stopped in lane one traveling eastbound on her way home from a local pharmacy. She stated in the interview that she was listening to the radio and singing in her car when she witnessed V1 hit V2's side. She stated that she slammed her brakes and stopped in her lane when she saw the crash happen in front of her. She thought she had plenty of room to not be involved in the crash but then saw V2 continue off the roadway and drive up a wire telephone pole. He was then air bound and dropped and bounced off her bumper in lane one. An associative factor related to this driver was that she was going through a divorce and was having personal problems. There was no damage to her vehicle but V2 did make final rest in front of where she was stopped. Her vehicle was not towed and she was not involved in the first harmful event and not thought to have contributed to the crash.
