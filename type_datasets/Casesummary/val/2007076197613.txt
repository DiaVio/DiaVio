This single-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane asphalt roadway. The eastbound lane curves left, straightens out then curves right and is downhill. The speed limit for the area is 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred just before noon during daylight with no adverse weather or road conditions present.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 GMC Sierra pickup, driven by a eighty four year old male was eastbound when the driver dozed off and it departed the right road edge. The right rear tire contacted a large rock, which punctured the tire. The driver steered left and braked and crossed over both lanes to the left where the rear left side of V1 contacted the guardrail. The driver steered right and sideswiped the guardrail on the right side of the road with the right side plane of V1. The driver steered left, rotated counter-clockwise and contacted the left guardrail with its right front plane. The metal toolbox bolted in the bed of the truck flew out at this point and landed on the other side of the guardrail. V1 continued to rotate counter-clockwise and contacted the left guardrail with its right rear corner and came to rest in the westbound lane facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver has a heart condition and hypertension and takes several prescription medications. He slept 7 hours the night before and is retired. He believes he fell asleep just before departing the right road edge.
