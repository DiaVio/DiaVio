The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a two-way, five-lane, undivided roadway. The center lane was a two-way left turn lane. This was a straight, level, asphalt traffic way, with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning, with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2004 Pontiac Vibe with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. A 2005 International Harvester delivery truck was parked and unoccupied in lane one, ahead of V1. The driver of V1, unaware that the delivery truck was stopped, continued to travel in lane one. Once the driver realized that the truck was stopped, she attempted to change lanes to the left. The front right corner of V1 made contact with the back left corner of the delivery truck. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
The Pontiac Vibe was driven by a 77-year old female, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. She said that her vacation had just come to an end, and she was on her way back home to her neighboring state. The driver was looking for the specific street that would take her to the interstate. The driver claimed that when she first saw the delivery truck, she thought it was a slower moving vehicle. She didn't recall seeing any brake lights or hazard lights activated. She continued to travel in the right lane. She had closed the gap between the two vehicles by the time she realized the truck was stopped. Her first thought was to change lanes to the left, but there was a red car occupying that lane, preventing her from doing so. The red car was traveling faster, and as it passed her, the driver thought she might still be able to make it, so she attempted to steer left. The driver indicated that although she came close to missing the truck, the right front edge of her car caught the back left edge of the delivery vehicle.
