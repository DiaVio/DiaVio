This crash occurred in the middle of a 4-way controlled intersection. The east/west roadway was an undivided 6-lane roadway. In the westbound direction, there were 3 lanes with lane 3 being a left-turn only lane. In the eastbound direction, there were 4 lanes with lane 4 being a left turn-only lane. A traffic control device that included a left turn-only arrow controlled all the lanes involved. All the roadways involved were straight, bituminous, and level. Both the east/west roadway and north/south roadways had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday. The roads were dry and the skies were clear. The traffic flow was congested due to lunch hour traffic and there was stop-and-go traffic activity.
V1, a 2000 Ford Focus station wagon with one occupant, was traveling west in lane four intending on making a left turn at the intersection. V2, a 2002 Hyundai Accent 4-door with one occupant, was traveling east in lane three intending on continuing straight through the intersection. The pattern of the lights at this intersection allowed the left turn-only lane to turn first by illuminating a left turn arrow which then changes to amber and then to a solid green, allowing vehicles in both directions to continue through the intersection. The left turn-only arrow does not change to red, which would not allow the vehicles to make a left at the intersection. So the vehicles that did not get a chance to make a left when the left turn-only arrow was illuminated can still make a left when and if the intersection clears. V2 was stopped at the light for the traffic control device. When V2 got a green light, it proceeded into the intersection. As V2 was traveling through the intersection, V1 made a left turn in front of V2 causing the left front of V2 to strike the left front of V1. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the 2000 Ford Focus, was driven by a 53-year-old female who reported "C" injuries but refused medical treatment. The driver of this vehicle refused an interview. V1 was traveling west and when it approached the intersection, and then made a left turn in front of V2. The driver of V2 stated that she had a green light, therefore V1 also had a regular green light, not a left turn-only light or amber left turn-only light. V1 did not yield to the right-of-way of V2.
V2, the 2002 Hyundai Accent, was driven by a 31-year-old female who reported "C" injuries but refused medical treatment. The driver stated that she was on her way home from work when she approached the intersection. She was the first vehicle in her lane waiting for the light to change so she could go straight through the intersection. The left turn arrow came on and then turned amber and then her light turned green. She proceeded into the intersection. She stated that before she started to go through the intersection she saw the other vehicle approaching the intersection with its turn signal on, but never thought that it would try to turn through the intersection because of how busy of an intersection this was. But she was mistaken and V1 turned in front of her. She stated that she did not have any opportunity to avoid the accident because it all happened too fast.
