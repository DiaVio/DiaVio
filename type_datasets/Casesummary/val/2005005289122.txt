V1 was a 2003 Chevrolet Impala, traveling northbound, and had a red light at the intersection. V1 reported to the Police and related to me to have driven through the red light, just prior to the crash. V2 a 2000 Ford Focus was traveling westbound through a green light at the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 struck V1 on the right rear door and down the side toward the right front door. V2 came to final rest in the middle of the intersection and in front of the opposing traffic. The impact caused V1 to be pushed up and spun counter clockwise by almost 180 degrees, in the intersection. When V1 spun around, it was reported that it struck V3. V3 was stopped waiting to proceed straight, in the opposite direction of V1. Shortly after the initial impact, V2 caught fire, probably starting at or near the battery, because of the angle of the crash for V2. Just V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. V3 was able to be driven from the scene.
The drivers of the three vehicles and the one passenger did not need treatment, because they did not suffer any injuries.
