This two-vehicle rear end crash occurred in early afternoon on a clear day. The crash occurred on a dry, level, bituminous, eight-lane roadway with three eastbound lanes. This roadway supports east to west traffic. The posted speed limit for this roadway was 72 kph (45 mph). There were no traffic control devices present at the location of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Dodge Durango with one occupant, was traveling east in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Ford Freestyle with four occupants, was traveling eastbound in lane three. Traffic was stopped in lane two to allow a tractor-semi-trailer to merge into lane two and then into lane 3. A large box van stopped in lane two to allow the vehicle to merge. V2, traveling in lane three, stopped due to congestion ahead. V1, approaching the box van, switched lanes to the left and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. Both vehicles came to rest at impact. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, a 34 year-old male, stated he changed lanes to get around the merging non-contact vehicle and struck V2 in the rear. He also stated that a large yellow box van obstructed his view of V1. He drives the route weekly and is familiar with the vehicle. He did not realize caution was required due to the traffic congestion.
The driver of V2, a 29 year-old female, was traveling to a mall from her residence. She drives the route daily and is familiar with the vehicle. She came to a stop in lane three and her vehicle was immediately struck in the rear. She did not see V1 prior to impact.
