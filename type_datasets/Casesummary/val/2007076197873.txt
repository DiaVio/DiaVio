The two westbound lanes are straight then curve right and are uphill in the area of the crash. The eastbound lane curves left before straightening out and is downhill. Just west of the area of impact, there is a rock embankment close to the eastbound road edge that obstructs the view for traffic in both directions. The posted speed limit is 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred in late afternoon with the sun fairly low in the western sky. Traffic for both directions was congested at the time of the crash. There were no adverse weather or road conditions present.
