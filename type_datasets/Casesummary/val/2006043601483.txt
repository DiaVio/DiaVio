This single vehicle crash occurred on a 2-lane street in a suburban neighborhood on a clear and dry weekend afternoon. The roadway ran throughout the subdivision with a speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). At the location of this crash, the roadway was curved to the right and there was a 3 percent downhill grade.
V1, a 1998 Dodge Dakota Club Cab with one occupant, was traveling west on this street when it drifted off the left side of the road and into a homeowner's front yard. The Dodge continued to travel down an embankment where it struck several trees with its front, right and left sides. The Dodge had to be towed from the scene due to disabling damage and the driver was transported to a trauma center for treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 60-year-old male who was returning home from the grocery store when he was involved in this crash. This driver stated he suffered a blackout after entering his neighborhood and cannot recall the sequence of events that led to the crash. The last thing he does remember about that afternoon was turning right onto the street he lives on and then having an EMS worker asking him questions following the crash. He crashed his truck three houses away from his home.
He stated he has a history of heart disease and he thinks his pacemaker may have contributed to his blackout but the medical results could not confirm his belief. He said he was not feeling well all day and that he had decided that if his poor health continued the next day, he was going to visit his doctor. Medical records indicated that the driver of V1 had suffered a seizure unrelated to his pacemaker or heart arrhythmia.
