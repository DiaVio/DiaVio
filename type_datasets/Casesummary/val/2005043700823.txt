The crash occurred in the median of a two-way, three lane interstate highway with a dirt median. The median was embanked upwards into a small 30% grade hill. There were three lanes each in the west and eastbound directions. The westbound lanes were curved gently to the right. The roadway was on level grade with a posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies.
Vehicle one was a 2001 Jeep Cherokee compact utility. V1 was traveling westbound in lane one when the driver lost control and traveled across the median. V1 traveled over the hill in the median. On the way down the other side, V1 rotated clockwise and then rolled left an unknown number of revolutions, coming to rest on its left side on the paved shoulder of the eastbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 63-year old male who was transported to a local trauma center with non-incapacitating injuries. He was unable to be located for an interview as his home number was disconnected and he had recently retired from work. The investigating officer estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 65 mph. V1 was towed due to damage.
