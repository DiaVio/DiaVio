The crash occurred at a four-leg intersection. The roadway leading eastbound into the intersection was a two-way, five-lane, undivided roadway. The roadway leading northbound into the intersection was also a two-way, five-lane, undivided roadway. These were straight, level, bituminous roads. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1995 Mitsubishi Mirage with one occupant, was traveling northbound in the left turn lane. V2, a 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in the left through lane. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V1 made contact with the right side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Mitsubishi Mirage, was driven by a 28-year old male who was not injured. He said that he was on his way home from a friend's house. He was in the left turn lane, about to turn. He advised that he was having an argument on a cell phone with his girlfriend, whom he had been having relationship problems with. He thought at the time his light was green, but was admittedly distracted by the conversation. He said that he looked left, and saw a vehicle slowing down to turn right, but did not see V2. At the last second he applied the brakes, but it was too late.
V2, the Mitsubishi Outlander, was driven by a 49-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he left a little early from work to go to a doctor's appointment. He said he was not sure which lane he was in, but was intending to go straight through the intersection. The driver indicated that the other vehicle turned into his vehicle, and that he only had time to steer left, at the last second.
