This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekend at an offset residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a curved two-way, two lane undivided roadway and the driveway to a condominium complex. The bituminous roadway was level and had a posted speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph). All roadways were wet as it was raining at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII, was stopped at the end of the driveway waiting to pull into the intersection. V2, 1999 Mercedes Benz C-230, was southbound in lane one approaching the intersection As V2 passed through the intersection V1 shot out from the driveway and struck the left side of V2 with its front. After the initial impact V2 departed the roadway and struck a tree on the left side of the road before coming to final rest against it. V1 came to final rest in the middle of the intersection near the initial point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by an 89 year-old male who stated that he had been stopped waiting to pull out of his condo complex when his foot slipped off the brake. He said he tried to recover but he pressed on the gas pedal instead of the brake. The driver was uninjured and was able to drive his car away from the scene.
V2 was driven by a 62 year-old male who was out running errands. He stated in his interview that as he was driving 56kmph (35mph), which he thought was the speed limit, when he saw V1 dart out into the roadway. He then steered the wheel right to try to avoid the impact, but it was unavoidable. He was uninjured but V2 was towed due to damage.
