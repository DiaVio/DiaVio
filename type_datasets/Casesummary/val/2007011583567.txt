The single vehicle, weekend, midday crash occurred off the right side of the 3 eastbound lanes of a 6-lane interstate with a median. The three eastbound lanes were bituminous, straight and level. Lane 3 turns into an exit lane approximately 1/2 mile east of the scene of the crash. At the time of the crash it was daylight, cloudy and the roadway was wet. The posted speed limit was 113 kmh (70mph).
V1, a 1997 BMW sedan solely occupied by the 51-year-old male driver, was eastbound in lane 3 of the roadway described above. V1 drifted onto the left shoulder and the driver overcorrected to the right causing V1 to re-enter lane 3 then cross lanes 1 and 2. V1 exited the roadway to the right striking a shallow ditch with its front. V1 then struck a tree with its left side and front and rotated clockwise. V1, left struck another tree and then V1, right, came to rest against a tree. At final rest v1 was facing northwest. The driver was transported and the vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver stated that he was eastbound in lane 3 at about 70 mph so that he could exit up ahead to the left. He said that a red pickup truck cut him off by cutting into his lane in front of him (he originally said that the red truck hit him knocking his vehicle onto the shoulder but there was no evidence of contact to another vehicle). He then overcorrected to the right and ran off the road to the right. He was going to a military recreation gathering where he was going to camp out and had only slept 2 Â½ hours that morning after working all night on the third shift. He had driven 110 miles. Police found weapons inside the car and an open bottle of liquor. The medical report showed .031 BAC.
