This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the four-leg intersection of north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal with no protected left turn phase, and the speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) in all directions. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions. In the intersection, the road surface is in poor repair, having large cracks and potholes.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Toyota Camry four-door sedan, was traveling eastbound in the first lane of a seven-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle two (V2), a 1988 Honda Accord four-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the fourth lane of opposing traffic. V2 was stopped in the intersection and awaiting an opportunity to turn left into southbound traffic. As V2 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 deflected right and rotated counter-clockwise as it departed the road over the southeast corner. On the roadside, the right side of V1 impacted a steel traffic light pole, bringing V1 to rest. V2 came to rest in the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The witness and driver statements agree that V2 had stopped in the intersection, and after the tri-light entered the red phase, V2 executed its turn. Local regulation gives V2 the right-of-way in this instance.
