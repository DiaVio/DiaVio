This single-vehicle crash occurred on a north/south roadway and was a two-way two lane undivided roadway. There was one lane in each direction on a straight, level, bituminous, roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). It was early afternoon with blowing snow on the roadway. The roadside was covered with a blanket of snow.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Subaru Outback station wagon with one occupant, was northbound going straight. The driver pulled over to the right as far as he could thinking a snowplow traveling the opposite way needed the room. The right rear tire got caught between the edge of the road and the snow piled on the roadside. V1 started to rotate clockwise off the road leading with its left side and the vehicle rolled over eight quarter turns. V1 came to rest on its wheels facing southeast in a snowy field. V1 was towed from the scene with very minor damage. The driver was not injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.
A 58 year-old male who was checked out by the paramedics and reported no injuries drove V1, the Subaru Outback. He had left home and was driving to a dentist's appointment and had plenty of time to get there. He usually takes another highway, but because of the blowing snow, that highway was closed. He drives this highway monthly and feels comfortable with the vehicle, but because of the snowplow, he felt he needed to give it room. He is retired and works out 3-4 times a week for an hour. He wears glasses to read and was not wearing them at the time of the crash. He takes Niacin on a regular basis and his health is good.
