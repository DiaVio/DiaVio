The crash occurred near an intersection of two 4-lane undivided roadways. The eastbound lanes were straight, bituminous, with a very slight uphill grade. The northbound lanes were bituminous with a slight curve to the left and an uphill grade of about two percent. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 56 kmph (35 mph). It was the early evening on the weekend while still daylight. Traffic flow was light.
V1, a 2006 Chrysler 300C 4-door sedan, was driven by a 59-year old male who was traveling alone. V1 was traveling eastbound in lane two at about 40 mph when the driver blacked out. V1 traveled out of lane 2 to the left, crossing over the westbound lanes. V1 then partially jumped up on a curb and then struck a light post. V1 then crossed over the southbound lanes and into the second northbound lane where V2 was traveling. V2 was a 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche pickup truck. The front of V1 struck V2 on its left front side. V1 then rotated about 45 degrees counterclockwise. It was then struck in the right rear by the left rear of V2. V1 and V2 came to a rest in lane one in the northbound lane of travel. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
After the crash, the driver of V1 stated that he did not know what had happened. He said he must have blacked out because all he remembered was driving up the street, and then the sound of the crash woke him up. The driver of V1 was not injured. He stated that he has pre-existing health conditions that have to do with sugar (diabetes). He said he had just come back from the golf course and he felt fine. He said it wasn't a hot day, so there was no reason he should have had a black out spell.
V2, the 2004 Chevy Avalanche, was driven by a 35-year old male who was transported due to injuries. The driver of V2 would not talk without attorney's approval. The attorney refused an interview for his client.
No Critical Pre-crash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to V2 because it was not involved in the first harmful event. No associated factors were coded to this vehicle.
