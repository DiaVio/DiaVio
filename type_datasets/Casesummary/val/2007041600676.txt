This crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The east/west roadway consisted of seven lanes divided by a concrete curbed median. There were no traffic controls for east/west traffic. The north/south roadway featured two undivided lanes and was controlled by a stop sign. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with clear skies. The bituminous roadways were dry, straight, and level. The traffic flow was congested, as it was afternoon rush hour.
V1, a 2001 Ford Ranger that was attempting to make a left turn from the middle of the intersection as he began his turn V2, a 2001 Ford Escape, was westbound in lane one intending to continue straight. As V1 began its left turn V2 was traveling straight in lane one and did not see him. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and came to final rest off the eastbound roadway. After the initial impact V2 departed the roadway over the northwest corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1 was a 51-year-old male, suffered minor injury but was not transported. He stated that he was in the middle of the intersection and the first two cars stopped to let him go. They waved him on as to say it was safe to go. When he proceeded he was struck by V2 who did not see him and was traveling in lane one. He could not see lane one as the 2 cars that stopped were blocking his view. It was not until after he had entered the intersection and saw V2 at the last moment. He tried to hit the gas and steer to the left but could not avoid the collision.
The driver of V2, a 24-year-old woman, was transported for treatment of non-capacitating injuries. She stated that she was on her way to get her hair done from work when she saw V1 turn right in to her. She stated it all happened so quickly that she was not sure if she even reacted.
