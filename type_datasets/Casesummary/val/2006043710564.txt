Vehicle 1 (V1) was a 2002 Volkswagen Jetta, four-door, subcompact, with one occupant traveling west in lane one. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1994 Chevrolet G30 large van with one occupant, was northbound in lane one. V2 was stopped at the stop sign. V1 was traveling straight. As V2 entered the intersection, the front plane of V1 contacted the right front plane of V2 at a right angle. After impact V1 traveled approximately 7.6m (25 ft.) toward the right and came to final rest near the northwest corner of the intersection facing west. V2 after impact traveled approximately 15.9m (52 ft) and came to final rest in the westbound lane facing south. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 26 year-old pregnant female, was transported from the scene with minor injuries. She advised that she was on her way to work that morning at a local hotel traveling the same way she does everyday. She was driving straight ahead at 56 kmph (35 mph) in lane one. She saw V2 approach the intersection from the left and assumed that he would yield the right of way for her. She remembered him stopping momentarily then proceeding right in front of her. She hit the brakes, but does not recall any of the events after that. VI was towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
The driver of V2, a 46 year-old male, was transported from the scene with minor injuries. He is disabled and currently not working. He volunteers at his church driving a church van on a weekly basis. That day he was en-route from the church to pick up members from around the community. He reports driving northbound in lane one until he approached the stop sign and flashing red signal. He claims he looked both ways, didn't see any vehicles coming, so he proceeded into the intersection where he was struck by V1 on his right side front. V2 was towed from the scene but it did not sustain disabling damage.
