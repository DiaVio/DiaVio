The crash occurred in an urban intersection where a major six-lane, north/south roadway crossed paths with a smaller, single-lane eastbound roadway. The north/south road had three travel lanes in each direction in the southbound approach to the intersection and five lanes of travel in the northbound approach (three northbound and two southbound). The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway was 48 kmph (30 mph). The crossing road, with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph), was one way with a single eastbound travel lane, and a parking lane on either side. Both bituminous roads were straight, level, dry, and free from any obvious defects. Traffic was congested on the north/south road on this cloudy, dark, weekday evening when the crash took place. Overhead and standard traffic lights with pedestrian signals controlled the intersection, and were found to be functioning properly.
V1, a 2004 Nissan Quest minivan with two occupants, was heading east on the eastbound road approaching the intersection from the west. V2, a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle with two occupants, was heading north in the middle lane, lane two, of the north/south roadway, and approaching the intersection from the south. The traffic light for northbound traffic was red and there were vehicles in lanes two and three that were stopped at the red light. The driver of V2, seeing that the light was about to change to green, changed lanes from lane two to lane one where there were no vehicles waiting, and proceeded to pass the vehicles to his left as he entered the intersection. V1 had already entered the intersection from V2's left side, and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2. V2 was halfway through the intersection when it was struck by V1. Upon impact, V1 proceeded east and came to its final rest facing east in its original travel lane in the middle of the intersection. The impact caused V2 to travel in an easterly direction and it also continued north and departed the roadway on the northeast corner of the intersection where it came to its final rest on the east sidewalk along the north travel lanes of the north/south road. It was known that the lights at the intersection were in the process of changing, but exactly who had the green light when V1 and V2 entered the intersection was unknown. Neither driver received any citation for disregarding a traffic signal or for any violations. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
V1, the Nissan Quest, was driven by a 69-year old male who had one passenger. V1 driver did not want to participate in the driver's survey and refused to take any contact information. What was learned about V1's pre-crash movements was learned from what he reported to the police. It was learned that V1 driver entered the intersection when his light was changing, and that V1 driver reported not seeing V2 until it was too late. V1 driver appeared to be in good health, and it was also known that he was not ill at the time of the crash. It was unknown if V1 driver was engaged in any non-driving activities at the time he was approaching, or entering, the intersection.
V2, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, was driven by a 67-year old male who advised that he and his wife were on their way home from just having taken care of some business in the city. V2 driver advised that he did not see V1 and that he, V2 driver, did have the green light when he entered the intersection. V2 driver explained that he did not see V1 until he entered the intersection, and at that point, it was too late. V2 driver stated that he drove this roadway on a daily basis for forty-seven years and that he was not engaged in any non-driving activities at the time of the crash. V2 driver suffered from Type II diabetes that was kept under control by medication, and he further advised that other than this condition, he was in perfect health. V2 driver stated that he was happily retired and had been in a fine mood until the time of the crash.
