The crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a four-way suburban intersection. The intersection consisted of a north/south five-lane undivided roadway intersected by an east/west three-lane undivided roadway controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. The north/south roadway was bituminous, dry and level. It curved to the right slightly in the northbound direction and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The east/west roadway was bituminous, dry, and straight with an uphill grade and a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The traffic flow was moderate and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer with one occupant, was northbound in lane two approaching the intersection. V2, a 2005 Jeep Liberty with one occupant, was westbound in lane two (a designated left turn lane) approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time. As V2 attempted its left turn it was struck on the left side by the front of V1. V1 spun around from the impact at approximately 170 degrees and came to final rest in the northbound turning lane. V2 was able to drive onto the other side of the westbound lanes and park. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 24-year-old female was transported due to injuries. She advised that she was traveling in lane two and that she had the green light as she approached the intersection. She said she noticed V2 out of the corner of her eye as she entered the intersection but did not have time to react.
The driver of V2, a 38-year-old female, was not injured. The driver stated that she entered the intersection making the left and V1 ran the light. She also stated that she sees a lot of people run the light at this particular intersection and that she knew that she would be involved in a crash sooner or later.
*From watching the TCD and intersection, it was observed that several people disobeyed the TCD in all directions and that the time delay in between the light change was only about 1.3 seconds.
