The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a primary arterial road that ran east/west. The road was straight with a positive grade (if westbound) of 3%. There were six travel lanes in the area of the crash with lane1 being a westbound right turn only lane for an uninvolved intersection to the west of the crash area, lanes 2 and 3 were two westbound through lanes, lane four was a two way left turn only lane east of the impact area but west of impact was a westbound left turn only lane, and lanes 5 and 6 were eastbound through lanes. The north side of the road had a private lot entry (driveway). Conditions at the time of the crash were overcast with daylight late on a weekday morning. The posted speed limit was 72kph (45mph).
V1 was a 2000 Chevrolet Ventura minivan originally traveling east in lane 5, which was attempting to turn left into the private lot on the north side of the roadway. Westbound lanes 2, 3, and 4 were stopped for a red light at an intersection west of the crash area. V2 was a 1999 Toyota 4Runner traveling west in lane one (westbound right turn only) and according to the driver traveling a little above the speed limit. V3, a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe was stopped in westbound lane 2 waiting for a green light to proceed. It (V3) was about 10 meters west of the west edge of the private lot entry. V1 made its left turn crossing lanes 2-4 successfully and as it entered lane one it contacted V2 head on at a deep angle. As V2 was rebounding (still traveling west) it went into a counterclockwise yaw and rolled 2 quarter turns onto its top, then struck V3 in the rear with its (V2's) front then it rotated counterclockwise on its top and struck V3 again and hit it on the right front with its left rear. V1 stopped in the private lot. V2 came to rest on its top straddling lanes 1 and 2 facing southeast. V3 came to rest a few meters west of its original position still facing its intended travel direction. V1 was driven from the scene. V2 and V3 were towed from the crash scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a twenty two year old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. He was charged by police for driving without a license and no insurance. He was unable to be contacted for an interview (interpreter necessary) after giving the researcher and police false contact information.
V2 was driven by a sixteen-year-old belted female who was not transported although she was coded by police as having possible injuries in the crash. She was on her way to her first day at work at the time of the crash.
V3, was driven by a sixty four year old belted male who with his belted passenger were also coded by police as having sustained possible injuries but were not transported. He was on his way home from working a charity yard sale.
V3 was not involved in the first harmful event of this crash and so the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. This vehicle did not have any contributing factors to the crash.
