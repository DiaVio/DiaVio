This single vehicle crash occurred shortly past noon on a two lane undivided asphalt roadway, surface icy and slushy with a curve to the left. There was a warning sign showing the road was coming off the curve onto a straight part of the road. The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph) with an advisory speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) for the curve.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chrysler Voyager mini van driven by a 83 year-old male with one passenger, was traveling southbound in lane one on a left curve mountain road. The driver noticed a pickup truck parked on the right shoulder with two orange colored gas cans sitting in front of it. The driver moved over to the left, still in his lane to pass the truck. The road had semi dry tracks where vehicles had driven and on both sides of the tracks in the lane was slush. The driver was traveling on the slush, lost control and entered the northbound lane. The vehicle then departed the left side of the road impacting an uphill mountain with its front. After the impact with the mountain, V1 rotated counter clockwise and came to rest on its wheels facing west partially on the shoulder and northbound lane. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
Additional factors were: too fast for conditions, poor directional control, and the external distraction of the stranded motorist.
