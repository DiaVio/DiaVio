This two-vehicle crash occurred at the intersection of a rural state highway and a private drive for entry to/exit from a public school parking lot. The highway runs from east to west, has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and consists of one through lane in each direction and a 2-way left turn lane. For westbound traffic, the highway curves to the left and is level in the area where the crash occurred. The parking lot exit is two-way, straight, and has a slight uphill grade and stop sign for exiting traffic. At the time of this late afternoon crash, the sun was low in the western sky, but there were no other adverse atmospheric conditions or road defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Geo Tracker compact SUV, was stopped at a stop sign intending to turn left and enter the highway. The V1 driver, a 62 year old female, stated that she is familiar with the road and saw V2 in the distance approaching from her left, then looked to her right and encountered sun glare, which temporarily affected her vision; she then slowly pulled forward, but did not realize that she had entered the westbound lane until it was too late and contacted V2 front to front. She added that she had slept 7 hours the previous evening and was on her way home from work, tired from working all day. The driver takes medication daily for high blood pressure and diabetes. The medications are: Avandia, Metformin and Verapamil. The V1 driver was transported for treatment but V1 was not towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle two (V2) a 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, was westbound in the number one lane. The V2 driver, a 57 year old male, could not be contacted for an interview. According to the police report, all four occupants of V2 were transported for injuries then released after treatment. V2 was towed due to damage.
