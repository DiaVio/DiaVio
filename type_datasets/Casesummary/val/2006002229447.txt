This crash occurred on a weekday morning on a two-lane undivided rural roadway. The east/west roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with an uphill grade greater than 2%. The roadway began curving to the right after it was intersected by a side road, near the point of impact. The traffic flow was normal and while there were no adverse atmospheric conditions existed at the time of the crash sun glare was present.
V1, an unknown vehicle, was decelerating while eastbound in lane one as it approached the intersecting roadway were it intended to turn left. V2, a 1999 Ford E-Series Van, was also eastbound in lane one traveling behind V1. V3, a 1989 Toyota Pickup, was eastbound in lane one behind V2. As V1 continued to slow to its turn V2 failed to decelerate accordingly and struck the rear of V1 as it began turning left. V3 was unable to slow down and struck the rear of V2. All vehicles came to final rest near their respective points of impact. V1 was driven from the scene before this researcher's arrival while V2 & V3 were towed due to damage.
