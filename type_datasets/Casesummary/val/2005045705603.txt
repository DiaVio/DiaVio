The crash occurred on a curving portion of a two lane, two-way urban undivided road. The roadway ran east/west and had a posted speed from both directions of 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash took place on a weekday during early rush hour at dawn with overcast skies. There were no shoulders and a field containing thick brush bordered the curb on the north side of the road. The south side of the road at point of impact was bordered by a private parking lot. The roadway was level for the approach of Vehicle #1, and Vehicle #2 had a positive grade of 3 percent.
Vehicle #1 was a 1994 Mazda 626 traveling eastbound on the roadway and headed into a right curve when it drifted into the oncoming lane, crossing the double yellow center line. Vehicle #2, a 2001 Ford Taurus, was westbound negotiating a left curve when the driver noticed the oncoming vehicle in its lane. Vehicle #2 slowed and then started to steer right but was struck in an offset (left side) frontal type crash. Vehicle #1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing north with the back of the vehicle in the private lot on the south side of the road and the front of the vehicle in the eastbound lane. Vehicle #2 also rotated counterclockwise, went off the north side of the road, and came to rest facing south in the bushes with the front of the vehicle about 2 meters from the road. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to severe damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The Mazda (V1) was driven by an unrestrained, unlicensed, twenty one-year old male who was suspected to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. The driver of Vehicle #1 was killed in the crash and was pronounced on scene. The frontal airbags in Vehicle #1 deployed.
Vehicle #2 was driven by a restrained, twenty five-year old female who was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries. A two-year old female was properly restrained in a child seat in the right rear seating position and suffered only minor bruising. The frontal airbags in Vehicle #2 did deploy. After a lengthy extrication process (4 hours) NMVCCS personnel were able to download the EDR data from the module, which proved to be useless (was called a non-deployment event by the software). After discussions with SCI personnel, we were informed that this is a common problem in that year, make and model of Taurus in severe offset left frontal crashes.
