This crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the middle of a four-way residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a two-lane east/west roadway controlled by stop signs (the stop sign for westbound traffic was obstructed by a tree growing near it) and a two-lane north/south roadway. Both roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) for each roadway. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1990 GMC Jimmy with one occupant, was westbound approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V2, a 2005 Chevy Malibu with one occupant, was southbound approaching the same intersection where it also intended to go straight. V1 failed to stop for the stop sign and entered the intersection. As V1 entered the intersection its front struck the left front side of V2. The two vehicles than side-slapped and V1 departed the roadway over the southwest corner of the intersection. The driver of V1 hit the accelerator and struck a light pole, and a For Sale sign before coming to final rest against a chain link fence. After the side-slap V2 traveled westbound until it struck V3, an unoccupied 2002 Nissan Xterra parked on the south side of the road, and came to final rest. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 56 year-old woman, was on her way to pick up a co-worker on her way to work. She stated in her interview that she was running late and did not see the stop sign because it was covered by a tree (see images). She remembered entering the intersection, striking V2 then panicking and hitting the gas, which caused her to strike several more objects before coming to final rest on a lawn. She was not injured but was cited for failure to stop at a stop sign.
The driver of V2, a 24-year-old male, was on his way to his girlfriend's house at the time of the crash. He stated in the interview that as he went through the intersection he saw V1 run the stop sign (he could not see V1 until he was already in the intersection due to a sightline restriction) and he tried to steer to the right but could not avoid the crash. He was transported to the hospital with minor injuries sustained in the crash.
An independent witness stated that she saw no brakes light from V1 and it never slowed down. She also added that there have been several crashes in the past few weeks due in part to the obstructed stop sign.
