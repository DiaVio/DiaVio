The crash occurred on a north/south two-lane roadway divided by a double yellow line. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph). It was early afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky clear. Traffic flow was light on this well traveled roadway.
V1 was a 2007 Ford Ranger pick-up truck driven by a 28-year old male, the sole occupant. The driver, a technician with a national cable installation company, had just come from a service call and was traveling north in lane one to his next service call. V1 was following V2, a 2000 Mercury Sable. Driver 1's supervisor stated that the driver had his window open while driving and that the directions to his next location blew off the seat and onto the floor. The driver was bent down retrieving the directions when he struck the rear of V2 with the front of V1. Driver 1's office manager gave a different version of the crash. He stated that the driver did not take his eyes off the road, but that V2 stopped suddenly, appearing to attempt a U-turn across double yellow lines and the driver of V1 had no time to react. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 was a 2001 Mercury Sable driven by a 41-year old female, the sole occupant. Driver 2 was visibly upset and complained of back pain, although she refused treatment. She stated that she had come from a personal meeting and had traveled about seven miles when she decided that she was traveling in the wrong direction and decided to turn left from the north lane one into a parking lot to review her directions. The driver stated that she had tracked V1 from her rearview mirror, seeing that he was more than two car lengths back, assumed that he would have time to react to her actions since she indicated the left turn using her left turn indicator far in advance to her decelerating to a stop.
