The crash occurred at an intersection of a north/south roadway and an east/west roadway that terminated at the intersection in the eastbound direction. The north/south roadway was an undivided three-lane roadway. To the east of the northbound lanes, there was a two-lane off-ramp that terminated at the intersection. The skies were cloudy with light rain and the roads were wet on this early evening holiday weekend. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph) in the north/south direction and 48 kmph (30 mph) in the east/west direction. Due to a prior lightning storm, power was out in the area, disabling all traffic and streetlights.
V1 was described as a black Saturn four-door sedan driven by a male. V1 was traveling west, exiting the off-ramp, at a reported high rate of speed when it entered the intersection without stopping. V1 crossed over the northbound lane one, traveling west, when it crashed into the front left portion of V2 with the front left portion of V1. After the crash, V1 reversed away from V2 before continuing forward in the westbound direction in lane one, leaving the scene at a high rate of speed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V2, a 2000 Ford Focus four-door sedan, was driven by a 43 year-old male traveling with his 46 year-old brother and 10 year-old son. They had just left the driver's home ten minutes prior to the crash to go shopping. The driver stated that he had been stopped in the left turn lane of the eastbound road, waiting his turn to proceed through the intersection. Without operating traffic lights, vehicles in all directions had been taking turns entering the intersection, treating it as a 4-way stop. The vehicles that were stopped in the north and southbound lanes indicated that it was V2's turn to proceed and so he did. According to the driver of V2, prior to his entering the intersection, there were no vehicles on the exit ramp. The driver of V2 never saw V1 approach from his right until the crash. Occupants were treated at the scene and released; all were visibly upset. The researcher could detect the smell of beer on the driver of V2 while the interview was conducted.
