This crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a grass median. There were two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. This concrete roadway was a slight downgrade that curved gently to the right, with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). It was mid-afternoon on a weekday and conditions were clear.
V1 was a 2001 Ford F-150 pickup that was towing a large flatbed trailer loaded with construction supplies estimated to weigh around 454 kgs (1000 lbs). V1 was driven by a 38-year old male. V1 was traveling north in lane one when the left rear tire of the vehicle suddenly lost pressure, causing the vehicle to begin weaving. The trailer then had a greater speed than the vehicle, causing it to begin a jackknife. The trailer pulled V1 off of the road edge on the right side and collided with a guardrail. The trailer became detached from the truck, rotated 180 degrees and came to rest off of the road on the right side. V1 was forced nose down and then rolled onto its left side when the trailer impacted the guardrail and became detached. V1 then rolled back onto its wheels and came to final rest on top of the trailer. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
