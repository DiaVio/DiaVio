The crash occurred at the intersection of two roadways. The east/west roadway was a two-way, seven-lane street, divided by a curbed median. The posted speed for east/west traffic was 64 kmph (40 mph). The north/south roadway was a two-way, three-lane, undivided street, with a posted speed of 48 kmph (25 mph). Traffic in all directions was controlled by a traffic light. These were straight, level, asphalt roads. Conditions were dark with streetlights on a weekday evening. The roads were dry and the skies were clear. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2002 Ford Explorer utility vehicle with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane two. V2, a 2007 Jeep Commander utility vehicle with six occupants, was also traveling eastbound in lane two, in front of V1. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. V1 observed a red light and stopped at the intersection. V2 did not stop. The front left of V2 made contact with the right rear of V1. After impact, V1 traveled across the intersection, striking a concrete utility pole on the southeast corner. V1 and V2 were both towed due to damage. The driver of V1 was transported to the hospital due to injury. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V1, the Ford Explorer, was driven by a 55-year old female. The driver stated that she was on her way to a friend's house, in the far right lane, when the driver of V2 cut her off. She said that she was forced to take an evasive action to the right, but could not completely avoid hitting V2 in the right rear corner. Although the driver indicated that she was in the right lane, it is believed that she was actually in the middle lane traveling behind V2.
V2, the Jeep Commander, was driven by a 35-year old male. He and his family were on their way to church. The driver indicated that he was stopped for ten to twenty seconds at the light, during which time he was having a social conversation with his father-in-law, who was sitting beside him in the passenger seat. Without warning, the driver was struck from behind. He indicated that the force of the impact pushed his vehicle through to the other side of the intersection.
