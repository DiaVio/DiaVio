A two-vehicle collision occurred on a four-way traffic signal controlled intersection. The northbound leg of the intersection is an off-ramp to an interstate highway and the westbound leg leads to an on ramp for the interstate roadway. All roadways were dry and illuminated. The collision occurred shortly before midnight. The northbound roadway is concrete, level, and one-way with three lanes of travel and a curve to the left. he westbound roadway is concrete and has a +6% grade and is straight. The posted speed for northbound travel was 72 kmph (45 mph); the posted speed limit for westbound travel was 64 kmph (40 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Dodge Dynasty sedan occupied only by the 56 year old male driver, was traveling north and had exited an interstate roadway onto a two-lane exit ramp which turned into three lanes closer to the intersection. V1 initially was traveling in the number one curb lane and later traveled to lane two (for left turn lanes at the intersection). V1 approached the intersection with the intention of turning left, the driver applied brakes for a red traffic signal and experienced no braking ability (brake failure). V1 driver stated he wanted to continue traveling across the intersection in order to slow vehicle down and avoid any possible collision with a crossing vehicle. Instead, V1 driver noticed a westbound vehicle and attempted to steer left in order to avoid collision, but the right front contacted the left front of that vehicle. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Honda Pilot SUV occupied by the 40 year old female driver and one passenger, was traveling west in lane two with the intention of going straight. As V2 approached the intersection, the driver noticed V1 approaching the intersection at a high rate of speed. V2 driver steered right to avoid a collision, but did not apply brakes. After contact with V2, V1 deflected off V2 in a northwesterly direction and side-slapped the left side of V2. V1 the departed the roadway on right side, and contacted a guardrail with its front end. The guardrail contact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and the right rear side of V1 contacted a traffic light pole. V1 came to final rest with the front against the guardrail and the right side against the pole. After both contacts with V1, V2 deflected off V1 in a northwesterly direction and traveled approximately 28 meters (92 feet) on the grass surface before coming to final rest off the roadway facing northeast. Both drivers sustained non-incapacitating injuries: the driver of V1 was transported; the driver of V2 was not transported and V2's passenger was not injured. V1 was towed due to damage; it is unknown if V2 was towed or driven from scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Associative factors assigned to V1 driver are as follows: V1 had a brake malfunction (police and the researcher on-scene confirmed this) The brake pedal went to the floor when pressed and never gained hydraulic pressure (pedal travel resistance). In addition, the driver stated having had brake maintenance several weeks prior to collision. The driver had slurred speech during the interview. He uses the following prescription medications: Lortab, Diazepam, Wellbutrin, and Lipitor. Blood alcohol test performed at hospital had a negative result. In essence, the slurred speech was reasoned to be a result of a medical condition or medications and not alcohol consumption.
V2's driver could possibly have prevented then collision by applying more aggressive evasive actions such as braking and steering right upon recognizing V1 traveling at a high rate of speed during approach to the intersection.
