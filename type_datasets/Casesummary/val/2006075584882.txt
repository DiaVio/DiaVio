This two-vehicle rear-end crash occurred in the westbound lane at a four-leg intersection. There is one lane in each direction at all four legs. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway, with a posted speed of 48 kph (30 mph). It was late afternoon during rush hour and traffic was moderate for that roadway.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 two-door Chevrolet Geo Metro with one occupant, was westbound in lane one going straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 four-door Ford Escape with one occupant, was westbound in lane one in front of V1 stopped to make a left turn. V1 was waiting for oncoming traffic to clear in order to complete the left turn. Driver had been stopped 5-10 seconds prior to impact. V1 did not stop and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest on its wheels facing southwest in lane one. V2 was pushed forward into the middle of the intersection and came to rest on its wheels facing west. V1 was towed from the scene while V2 was driven. The driver of V1 received a minor injury and was not transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
A 24 year-old male drove V1. He advised he had just left a friend's house and needed to be home to get ready for work. He had driven a mile and was following V2 at a speed of 40 kph (25 mph) and started to look at the dash to push the button on the CD player when the crash occurred. The driver stated he has Bronchitis and is taking Amoxicillin. He has astigmatism and wears glasses. He slept ten to twelve hours the night before, because he wasn't feeling good and usually sleeps ten hours a night and felt rested. He worked 22 to 25 hours the week before the crash, with the shortest day of three hours and the longest day of six and one half hours.
A 28 year-old female drove V2. She advised she had dropped her children off at their father's and driving home. She was stopped to make a left turn and looked in her rear view mirror and saw V1 and knew the driver was not going to stop. She released the brake to cushion the impact because she is eight weeks pregnant and didn't want the airbags to go off. She advised that since she is eight weeks pregnant, that she is taking prenatal vitamins. She is near sighted and wears contacts. She slept nine and one half-hours the night before the crash and hadn't taken her nap yet. Her normal sleep is seven and one half hours, with a one-hour nap and she wakes up rested. She works 16 to 20 hours a week with four hours being the average workday.
