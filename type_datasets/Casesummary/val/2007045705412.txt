The crash occurred on a westbound stretch of interstate highway that had three lanes with paved shoulders, was straight, with a negative grade of 3.5 percent. Westbound lanes were separated from the uninvolved eastbound lanes by a grass median. Conditions at the time of the crash were overcast skies with moderate rainfall and wet roads in the early afternoon on a weekday. The north side of the road had a negative side-slope of 14.5 percent. There was a drainage ditch a few meters north of the north road edge and the interstate was lined with galvanized steel light poles. The speed limit in the crash area was 89kmph/55mph.
V1 was a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina 4-door sedan that was traveling west in lane one of the interstate when it began braking in an attempt to slow down and broke traction. V1 began to skid clockwise as it departed the right side of the road and struck a light pole with its left side on the second row door. The pole broke from its base and fell on top of the rear glazing and rear deck-lid of V1. V1 continued to rotate clockwise and as it passed over the drainage ditch, the rear portion of the undercarriage struck the ditch with V1 coming to rest facing northeast. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a seventy-one-year-old-belted-female who was uninjured in the crash. She was on her way home from doing water aerobics at the time of the crash. She said she was just braking for traffic slowing ahead when the crash events occurred.
