The crash occurred in an intersection controlled by a traffic signal on a clear, dry weekend in the late afternoon. V1, a 1994 Chevrolet Blazer, was traveling northbound in lane one on a three-lane, straight, level bituminous road. The driver of V1, a 20 year-old female, saw the green light ahead and as she approached the intersection she leaned down to pick up a container of decongestant medicine. When she looked back up the light was yellow and she decided to go through the intersection, traveling slightly above the posted 56kph (35mph) speed limit. Traffic was stopped in the westbound left turn lane of the cross street and the driver did not see any vehicles moving near the intersection.
V2, a 2001 Chrysler Sebring, was traveling westbound on a five-lane straight, level, bituminous road in lane two approaching the same intersection. The traffic signal turned green for V2 so the 28 year-old female driver, moving at about the posted 72kph (45mph) speed limit, proceeded through the light. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1 in the intersection. The driver of V2 saw V1 two seconds prior to the crash and had no time for avoidance maneuvers. The left side of V2 then struck the right side of V1. V2 then traveled to the northwest corner where it left the roadway. The front of V2 struck the cement base (85cm) of a signpost and came to rest with the left side against a utility pole facing northwest. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. The driver and passenger airbags deployed and the fully restrained driver, who was extricated from the vehicle, was transported due to injuries. The five year-old male and the three year-old female in the rear seat also were transported to a local trauma center. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
This driver also was coded for other Contributing Factors of fatigue, as she works 55 hours per week, has young children who “wear her out”, and had been moving furniture at home during the week prior to the crash. Health conditions coded include asthma, allergies and a cold. Her medications are a prescribed bronchodilator for the asthma, progestin, and an over-the-counter decongestant for the allergies and cold. Some of the possible side effects for these medications are dizziness, sleeplessness, anxiety, tension, and tremors, which can be increased by the use of some antihistamines. Finally, the crash occurred the day before a holiday and the driver's schedule was filled with a series of short stops in preparation for the next day.
