Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu with two occupants, was traveling west in the fourth lane. This was a left-turn only lane. V1 was stopped at a red light and preceded into the intersection after the light turned green. V1 was going to turn left into the southbound lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Isuzu NPR single unit truck with one occupant, was traveling north in the second lane of traffic approaching the intersection of both roadways. At the intersection of both roadways, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise and both vehicles moved together in a northerly direction. The two vehicles side-slapped in the process. Both vehicles came to rest within the northbound lanes, facing north. V1 was towed from the scene. Both occupants of V1 were transported. The left front door was pried open by the fire department to remove the driver of V1. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A 78-year old male drove V1, the 2001 Chevrolet Malibu. He and his wife were heading to church from their residence, located within 6 miles (9 km) of the crash site. He said he would do that several times a week. The driver was in remarkable good health for his age. He does take a number of drugs that do not affect his driving. He was a little hard of hearing and admitted he should have a hearing aid. During the interview he pointed out the correct pre-crash position of both vehicles. He had a copy of the police report and noticed both vehicles were traveling in the wrong lanes on the police sketch
A 21-year old male drove V2, the 2001 Isuzu Truck. He came from the eastbound service road of the major highway and turned left into the northbound lanes. There was no traffic in the northbound lanes at this time. He said he was in the second lane, traveling at a normal rate of speed. He saw he had a green light at the north intersection. He watched the road in front of him while approaching the intersection, but did not pay any further attention to the traffic lights ahead. He said V1 all of a sudden crossed his path. At this time he realized the lights must have changed. He steered to the left to avoid the crash. The driver was heading from one job assignment to another. He does not take any drugs or medication, was well rested and not in a hurry. He drives once or twice a week on this roadway.
