This two-vehicle crash occurred on a weekend afternoon in the middle of a four-way rural intersection. The intersection consisted of a north/south 2-lane undivided roadway intersected by an east/west 2-lane undivided roadway controlled by stop signs (for the east/west roadway). All roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) for all directions. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1994 Ford Thunderbird LX with one occupant, was eastbound approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V2, a 1994 Ford Aerostar XL with two occupants, was northbound toward the same intersection where it also intended to go straight. V1 stopped briefly before proceeding into the intersection at the same time V2 entered the intersection. The front of V1 struck the left side of V2 and both vehicles came to final rest in the northeast corner of the intersection. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage and V2 was towed from the intersection to clear the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 49-year-old female, was returning home this afternoon when she was involved in this crash. On her way home, she stopped at a gas station to buy a lottery ticket and was less than two miles from her home when she crashed at this intersection. She claimed that she was traveling east and stopped at this four-way intersection, looked north and south for traffic and after believing the intersection was clear and proceeded forward. After entering the intersection, she realized there was a northbound vehicle in front of her so she steered left and braked. She could not avoid a collision and the front of her car struck the left side of the northbound V2. This driver claimed that the sunset obscured her view of northbound traffic even though she was wearing low-tint sunglasses.
The driver of V2, a 47-year-old female, said she saw V1 approach the intersection, slow down, and then try to accelerate across the intersection. This driver said she knew there was a stop sign posted for V1's direction and she assumed that V1 would stop.
