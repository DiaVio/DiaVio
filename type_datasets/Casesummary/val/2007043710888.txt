This single-vehicle crash occurred along a downhill, curved left stretch of roadway. It has a negative -4.6% grade with a positive +4% super-elevation. The road has 0.5 meter (1.6 feet) paved shoulders, with negatively sloped grass shoulders beyond them. The authorized speed limit was 64 kph (40 mph) with a curve left advisory speed of 56 kph (35 mph). Setting was evening hours on a weekend. Conditions were dark and clear with light traffic.
Vehicle One was a 2005 Mercedes Benz E-55 Compressor full-size sedan with three occupants traveling northbound in lane one. While traveling at 128 kph (80 mph), V1 departed the road to the right. V1 then crossed over a paved driveway and entered into a negatively sloped ditch. This ditch prevented V1 from being able to re-enter the roadway to the left. While traveling in the ditch, V1 struck a wooden railroad tie with its right side (event 1). V1 then continued traveling north another 14.6 meters (45 feet) where it struck a large diameter tree with its right plane (event 2). That impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and strike a 2nd large diameter tree 5 meters (16.4 feet) north with its front plane (event 3). V1 then re-entered the roadway, left side leading and started to roll over along its left axis. V1 rolled onto its left side, and then rolled to its right side returning to its wheels (event 4). V1 traveled 35 meters (82 feet) from event 2 to final rest. V1 came to final rest on partially on the west shoulder of the southbound lane facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is 129 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 is a 26 year-old male who was not injured in the crash. After the crash a firefighter told him to flee the scene and not wait around for police. He is a bartender at a local bar approximately 4 miles up the road from the crash scene. He had the day off and was at his place of employment drinking with his two friends. They all decided to leave the bar and go party and drink some more at another friend's house, several miles away. The driver was the least drunk of the three, so he offered to drive. The car belonged to the front seat passenger and the driver had never driven this car before. Since it was a warm night, they rolled the windows down and cranked the music up in the car while driving. As they approached a winding section of road, the driver decided to test the power and handling of the high-end Mercedes. He accelerated to over 112 kph (70 mph), but couldn't give an exact speed. Not being familiar with the handling of the car, he departed the road on the right side. He attempted to bring the car back on the road by steering left, but the ditch was to steep and it sucked him in deeper. He then struck the tree with the right, front section, spun around and came to rest in the roadway. He then exited the vehicle and sat on the ground next to the car until the fire department arrived. His vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling right side damage.
