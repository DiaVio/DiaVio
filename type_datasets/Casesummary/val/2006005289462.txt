This one vehicle crash occurred on a weekday morning on the northwest corner of a suburban T-intersection. The intersection consisted of two, two-lane roadways, a north/south roadway intersected by an east/west roadway. The bituminous roadways were dry, straight, and level with each having a posted speed limit of 40kmph (25mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Volkswagen Jetta, was northbound on the roadway approaching the intersection where it intended to turn left. V1 took the turn too wide and struck the curb for the westbound lane. Upon impact the driver lost control and returned to the roadway briefly, but struck the westbound curb again, before coming to final rest partially off of the roadway. The impact caused the right front axle to break off of the vehicle and both front airbags to deploy. The vehicle was towed from the scene as a result of damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 21 year-old female, was found lying on the ground upon the responding officer's arrival. She was transported to a medical facility for treatment where she was diagnosed with a neck sprain. There was one other occupant in the vehicle when the crash occurred who suffered possible injuries, but did not require any medical attention. Due to communication barriers, an interview with this driver could not be obtained. A partial explanation was given by the passenger who claimed steering failure, as the driver attempted to make the turn. After inspecting the vehicle, no mechanical failures were thought to have contributed to this crash. It is unknown whether any fatigue or health related issues were factors in this crash.
