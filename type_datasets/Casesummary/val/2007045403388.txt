V1, the Saturn SL1, was driven by a 58-year old female who was not injured. The driver reported that she was traveling from home to work at an unknown speed. She said she needed to change from lane two to lane one, which was a right turn only lane, so she glanced into her rear view mirror to see if anyone was there. When the driver looked back forward she said she saw V2 stopped about two car lengths ahead of her. She reported that she applied her brakes but was unable to stop before she struck V2.
V2, the Jaguar XKR, was driven by a 38-year old female who received possible injuries and was transported to a hospital. The driver reported that she was stopped behind other cars in a line of traffic stopped for the red light. She advised that she had been stopped over 10 seconds and glanced into her rear view mirror and noticed V2 approaching her from behind. She added that she could do nothing to avoid being hit from behind by V1.
