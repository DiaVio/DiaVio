It is a two-lane asphalt roadway from west to east. The speed limit is 54 kph (35 mph) for both roadways. The road surface was wet, it was raining heavily at the time and in sections the roadway was under water. The crash occurred during the early afternoon hours on a weekday with moderate traffic. A heavy rainfall started a few minutes prior to the crash and the road surface was slick since the accumulation of dirt and grime had not washed off the road surface.
