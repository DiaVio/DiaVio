A two-vehicle collision occurred on a Monday morning in daylight during the morning commute. The collision occurred on the east side of an intersection, of a 5-lane undivided roadway. The pre-crash roadway is level and straight, with bituminous paving. This intersection was going to be set up as a work zone later that morning. This was verified by the researcher who spoke with some of the flagmen that arrived after the crash had occurred and appear in the on-scene images. All of the traffic cones were off the roadway prior to the crash and no lane closures had occurred prior to the crash. The workers showed up after the crash and had been working about 1.6-kilometers (one mile) from the crash location. The trilight traffic controls were fully functional at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle 1 (V1), a 1999 Toyota Corolla, was traveling north in lane two, stopped behind an uninvolved vehicle, an unspecified truck. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2004 Hyundai Sonata, was traveling south in lane three preparing to turn left to head east on a separate highway. As V2 initiated the left turn on a green arrow, V1 moved around the truck it was behind, and preceded through the intersection, the front right of V1 impacted the right side of V2. V2 then rolled onto its left side and rotated 180 degrees coming to rest on the left side facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
