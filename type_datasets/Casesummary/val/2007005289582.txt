This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early evening hours on a weekday, in the middle of a T-intersection. The two intersecting roadways were both two-lane undivided bituminous roadways that were dry, level and straight at the crash location. The westbound roadway ended at the intersection and was controlled by a stop sign. There was no control device for north or southbound traffic and the posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal. It was dark out and the roadway was not illuminated.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Honda Accord 4-door sedan, was heading west on the roadway approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1982 Dodge Ram van, was heading north on the roadway intending to continue straight through the intersection. As V1 entered the intersection, its left side was struck by the front of V2, which had depressed its brakes, leaving approximately 40 meters of skid marks. After the initial impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 130 degrees before coming to final rest partially off of the roadway at the top of the intersection facing east. Vehicle two rotated clockwise approximately 45 degrees and continued off the right side of the roadway where it came to final rest. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 68 year-old male, had to be extricated from his vehicle and was transported to a medical facility for treatment. According to the medical reports, he suffered two mild fractures of the spine at location C6. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of this vehicle. For this reason, it is uncertain whether any fatigue or health related factors contributed to this crash.
The driver of V2, a 55 year-old male, was not injured as a result of the crash and did not require any medical treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle. He stated that he saw the other vehicle at the intersection and couldn't believe that the guy was actually going to go. He then claimed that V1 stopped in the middle of the intersection and that he could see the driver's eyes. The driver of V1 relayed that it was like witnessing a “deer in headlights.” As soon as he realized things were not right, he stood up on the brakes and tried to steer to the right in an attempt to avoid the vehicle that was in the intersection, but he could not avoid it. The driver related that he was not tired and that he was familiar with the roadway. He stated that he was in good health and that he had not taken any medication, prescription or otherwise, prior to the crash. The driver was very comfortable with his vehicle and there were no mechanical contributing factors.
