The north/south roadway was level with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The east/westbound roadway had a 2 percent uphill grade in the eastbound direction with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The intersection was controlled by traffic lights on each corner. It was night on a weekday. The roads were wet, but the sky was clear. Traffic flow was light.
V1, a 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee utility vehicle with two occupants, was traveling east when it entered the intersection without observing the traffic signal and struck V2 on the right side. Following this impact, the two vehicles struck each other in a side slap-type impact, with the left rear side of V1 striking the right rear side of V2. This impact caused V2, a 2007 Honda Accord 4-door sedan with one occupant, to depart the roadway to the right. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V2, a 35-year-old male, reported a complaint of pain and was transported to the hospital. The driver told police that he was stopped at the intersection and when the light turned green he proceeded through. He said that V2 ran the red light and struck him on the right side. V1 took no avoidance maneuver.
