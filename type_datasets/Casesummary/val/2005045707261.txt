The crash occurred on an east/west, two-way primary arterial state highway that had three lanes at the portion where the crash occurred. It was intersected by a secondary arterial road that ran north/south and was a two-way, two-lane road. The center lane on the highway was a left turn only lane. The highway was straight and level. At the northwest corner of the intersection was a steep embankment with a negative 40% grade that leveled off after dropping for some 2 meters. There was quite a bit of shrubbery in this area. The speed limit for the highway was 72kph/45mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight, overcast with wet pavement and no rain early on a weekend morning.
Vehicle #1 was a 1991 Ford Explorer traveling westbound on the state highway when it initiated a U-turn from the right westbound lane using the secondary arterial roads south intersecting portion as a turnaround. Vehicle #1 then proceeded out into the eastbound lanes of the highway (without stopping) and struck Vehicle #2, a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer, in the right rear with its (V1's) front. Vehicle #2 pulled to the right shoulder into a parking lot and came to a stop. After initial impact Vehicle #1 swerved into the westbound travel lane (while traveling east) and struck Vehicle #3, a 1992 Chevrolet S-10 pickup that was towing a small trailer loaded with a floor buffer, head-on. Vehicle #3 then veered right and went down the embankment and came to rest facing northwest in the shrubs. After the second impact Vehicle #1 spun counterclockwise and began traveling west again. It also went off the northwest corner of the intersection but it was beginning to skid to its right so as it (V1) traveled down the embankment it tripped and rolled ¼ turn to its right and came to rest facing southwest in the shrubs. The middle passenger in the 2nd row of Vehicle #1 was completely ejected from the vehicle. Vehicle #1 and 3 were towed due to damage, and Vehicle #2 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
