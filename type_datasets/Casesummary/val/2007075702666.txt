This single-vehicle crash occurred in the westbound lanes on an interstate highway. A concrete barrier divides this roadway and the westbound traffic lanes consist of three through lanes and an exit lane. The traffic lanes are bounded on the south side by a 5.4 meters (18 feet) wide concrete shoulder followed by the median barrier. The concrete shoulder has longitudinal grooves while the through traffic lanes do not. This roadway is concrete, curves to the south with a radius of 726 meters (2,381 feet). The roadway is slightly curved to the left with a superelevation of 2%. The crash occurred on an upgrade of 2.5%. The posted speed limit is 105 kmph (65 mph). It was in mid-afternoon on a weekday with moderate traffic flow. It had been raining moderately all afternoon. Drainage of the rainwater off of the shoulder occurs at the sag or bottom of the slope.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Explorer with three occupants, was traveling westbound in lane four. The roadway was wet and V1 started to hydroplane. V1 drifted into lane three, and to avoid contact with other vehicles, the driver of V1 steered to the left. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise as it traveled back across lane four and across the left shoulder. The front of V1 struck the concrete barrier as it continued to rotate counterclockwise on the shoulder as the back right corner struck the barrier before the vehicle came to rest facing north-northwest. Scrub marks from the four tires identified the path of the vehicle on the concrete shoulder. V1 was towed due to damage. None of the occupants were injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a forty-seven-year-old male, was driving with his wife and his son from their home to a friend's house. The driver stated he was traveling in lane four and "hit a water bank or something" and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle started to enter lane three so the driver steered left. He was well rested, very comfortable with his vehicle, and drives this route two or three times a week. He is in good health and takes no medications. He stated that he wasn't speeding, which was backed up by a witness statement in the PAR narrative and witness interview. The tires from V1 were all inflated well above the recommended tire pressure. The standing water on the roadway was considered the primary factor for initiating the hydroplane.
