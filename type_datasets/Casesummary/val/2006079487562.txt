This single-vehicle collision occurred during morning daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred near the intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The intersection was controlled by a tri-light traffic signal, and the speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) in all directions. At the time of the crash it was raining, and the asphalt roadway was wet, but otherwise free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Lexus SC430 two-door coupe, was traveling northbound in the first lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided roadway, approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V1 neared the intersection, the driver suffered a seizure. V1 drifted left as it traversed the intersection, crossing all north-south lanes. On the opposite side of the intersection, V1 departed the road over the west curb, where the front of V1 impacted a signpost, knocking it down. The front of V1 then contacted a support wire for a utility pole in a sideswipe motion. V1 continued forward and impacted a chain-link fence with its front, bringing the vehicle to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
