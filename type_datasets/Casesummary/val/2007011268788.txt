The crash occurred on a two-way highway divided by a grassy median with trees, with two lanes in each direction and with a posted speed limit of 113 kmh (70 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday evening crash were daylight, cloudy and dry.
V1, a 2007 Mazda 626 4 door sedan, was driven by a 45 year-old female with her 19 year-old daughter front right passenger and her 51-year-old husband in the second row right side. The family was returning home from an out of town (neighboring country) weekend wedding, half way through the 8-hour trip. The driver had taken over as driver at the rest stop 30 minutes prior and was driving the rental vehicle for the first time, and was unfamiliar with the road. The Mazda was in lane two traveling 97 kmph (60 mph). The driver stated that her daughter asked her if she missed the exit because she could not see their friend's vehicle ahead of them. While conversing, the driver was negotiating a curve to the left, and then lost control of the vehicle. Although the driver and front seat passenger did not know what happened, the husband in the back seat stated that the driver continued to steer around the curve after the road straightened. He stated that the driver then overcorrected to the right, steered back left and lost control. V1 rotated clockwise, crossed lane one and the paved shoulder, and left the road on the right side with the left side leading. V1 traveled along the edge of a ditch, crossed the ditch in the air and struck the far side with the left side of the vehicle. V1 came to rest in the ditch facing northwest and was towed due to damage. The fully restrained driver and occupants were treated on the scene due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
