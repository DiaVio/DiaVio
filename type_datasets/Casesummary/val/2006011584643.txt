The crash occurred on a fully controlled, divided with a grassy median, rural highway with two lanes in each direction with a posted speed limit of 113 kmh (70mph). The one-way eastbound lanes are bituminous, level, and curve to the right. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, driven by a 42 year-old female on a work trip, was eastbound in lane two negotiating the curve. The driver felt the vehicle hit something in the road "like a bump." V1 pulled to the left, leaving the roadway onto the paved shoulder and contacted the rumble strip. The driver stated that she overcompensated steered right and braked, and V1 crossed lane one and left the road on the right side. V1 crossed the right shoulder, and went into a ditch. The front of V1 struck the embankment on the far side. The left back corner of the Monte Carlo struck the embankment as V1 came to rest across the ditch facing southeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver refused treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
