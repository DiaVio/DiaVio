Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Volkswagen Jetta sedan driven by a 29 year-old female, was traveling east in lane 1. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 BMW X3 compact utility vehicle driven by a 44 year-old female with one passenger, was traveling east in lane 1. V2 had stopped for several seconds to make a left hand turn onto a side street when the front of V1 impacted the rear of V2. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. V2 was driven from the scene of the crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 could not figure out why she had rear-ended V2. Some speculations on her part include that the brake lights of V1 were not on, or perhaps that she was looking somewhere other than at V2. She was on her way home from the grocery store and had driven about 5 kilometers (3 miles) when the impact occurred. She had concerns with personal relationships and was thinking about a personal problem prior to the collision.
