Vehicle one, (V1), a 1997 Ford Probe, 2-door hatchback, driven by a 44 year-old male with one passenger was traveling northbound in the number one lane when the vehicle experienced an engine malfunction causing the vehicle to stop in the traffic lane. The driver then activated the rear emergency lights and began to ask the right front passenger to switch seats with him and to pop the hood so he could check the engine. At that point, the rear of V1 was struck by the front of V2. The impact caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise. The front of the vehicle struck a guardrail and the vehicle eventually came to rest in the number one lane facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Sterling 4x2 straight truck, driven by a 30 year-old male was traveling northbound in the number one lane at approximately 48 kmph (30 mph) when the driver reached down to pick up his soda. The driver then looked up and saw V1 stopped in his lane with the rear emergency flashers on. The driver then applied the brakes (no lock up) and steered to the left to avoid the crash. The front of V2 struck the rear of V2, causing V2 to rotate counterclockwise and travel into the number two lane. The vehicle then rotated clockwise and traveled across the number one lane in a northeasterly direction striking a guard rail on the east side of the roadway where it came to rest facing in a northeasterly direction. V1 was towed from the scene driver and passenger were transported to a local medical facility. V2 was driven from the scene.
