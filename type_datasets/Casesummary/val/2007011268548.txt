The 2-vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a 4 lane interstate with a median without a positive barrier. The 2 southbound lanes were bituminous and straight with a downhill grade >2%. At the time of the midday, weekday crash it was daylight, the roadway was dry, the weather was clear and traffic was moderate to heavy. The posted speed limit was 113 kmh (70mph).
V1, a 2007 Jeep Commander solely occupied by a 32-year-old male driver, was southbound in lane 1 of the roadway described above. V2, a 2006 Honda Element solely occupied by a 28-year-old female driver was southbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above beside and slightly back of v1. As v2 began passing v1, v1 started to change lanes to the left. The left front of v1 contacted the right side of v2 causing v2 to go into a clockwise yaw across lane 1 and v1's path. V1, front, contacted v2, right, and both vehicles exited the roadway to the right. Both vehicles went down an embankment with v2 sliding sideways, left side leading and v1traveling forward. V2 tripped and rolled 5/4 turns to the left coming to rest on its left side facing northwest. As it was upside down during the rollover, v1, front, contacted v2, left. V1 came to rest almost against v2 facing southwest. Neither driver was injured but both vehicles were towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of v1 stated that he was southbound in lane 1 going about 75 mph when he saw traffic slowing. He said he checked his side mirror and saw nothing so he began changing lanes to the left. He felt a bump and saw v2 out of the corner of his eye at the same time. He then cranked the wheel to the right but v2 spun to the right in front of him and he hit v2 on the right side sending them both off the roadway to the right. V2 rolled over and v1 hit it again while it was rolling over then came to rest almost against the undercarriage of v2. The driver said he was not in a hurry but was on his way back to work (as a car salesman) from running a personal errand. He said he never saw v2 and it must have been in his blind spot. Traffic conditions were moderate to heavy.
The driver of v2 stated that she was southbound in lane 2 going about 71-72 mph. She had noticed v1 when he entered the expressway and noticed him changing lanes to get around slower traffic. She said he was in the right lane and switched to the left lane to get around a slower car as she was passing him and she may have been in his blind spot. She felt his left side hit her right side. She overcorrected steering into the right lane and then he pushed her off the right side of the road where she rolled over.
