This is a two-vehicle intersection crash that occurred mid-afternoon in daylight hours at a four-way intersection that is controlled by a traffic light on colors. There are two westbound and two eastbound lanes that are separated by a left turn lane. There is also a westbound right turn lane at the intersection. There is one northbound and one southbound lane also separated by a left turn lane. There is a dedicated right turn for northbound traffic at the intersection. The roadways are straight, level and constructed of bituminous asphalt. The speed limit for the roadways is posted 56 kmph (35 mph). The roadway was dry and the sky was clear and the traffic was heavy at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V-1), a 1993 Ford Explorer XL 4x4 driven by a 30 year-old female was stopped behind another vehicle in the left turn lane. Vehicle two (V-2), a 1982 Chevrolet S-10 4x2 pickup driven by a 53 year-old male was traveling eastbound in the #2 lane approaching the intersection. The traffic light turned yellow and the vehicle in front of V-1 turned left just as V-2 entered the intersection. V-2 had to apply the brakes to avoid striking the non-contact vehicle. V-1 then began to make a left turn. The front of V-1 struck the front of V-2 just as V-1 began to make a left turn. The vehicles apparently came to rest in the intersection. V-2 moved to the southwest corner in a dirt lot of the intersection. V-1 apparently came to rest near the southwest corner of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V 1 stated that she was traveling westbound in the #3 lane. She then entered the left turn lane and stopped behind another vehicle for about 10 seconds that was stopped in the intersection waiting for traffic to clear. She said that she was in the intersection as well. The light turned yellow and the vehicle in front of her made a left turn. She then followed the vehicle because she did not want to get struck in the intersection. She said that she saw V-2 approaching the intersection and thought it was going to stop for the light. The vehicle was removed from the scene on it's own power.
The driver of V 2 stared that he was traveling eastbound approaching the intersection in the #2 lane. He began to slow down prior to the intersection. The traffic light turned yellow just as he entered the intersection. He saw a vehicle stopped in the intersection. That vehicle made a left turn. He had to apply his brakes to avoid hitting that vehicle. He then saw V-1 turn left also behind the non-contact vehicle. He also advised that he was nearly stopped when V-1 hit him. The vehicle was towed due to damage.
An associated factor for this vehicle could also be the non-contact vehicle that was in front of V-2 that created a sight line restriction.
