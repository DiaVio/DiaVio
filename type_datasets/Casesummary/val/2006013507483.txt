This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on the eastern side of a rural, two-lane roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction, with a 5-meter deep ditch running parallel to the roadway on the east side. The bituminous roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). The roadway was wet due to the intermittent rain that was falling throughout the day of the crash.
V1, a 4-door 1990 Honda Civic with three occupants, was southbound on the roadway when the vehicle drifted off the roadway to the right. The driver then overcompensated as he attempted to reenter the roadway by steering to the left. This maneuver caused the vehicle to begin to rotate in a clockwise direction. V1 traveled across both lanes and departed the roadway again on the left (east) side. The left front of V1 contacted the earth mound on the east side of the ditch that ran parallel to the roadway. V1 than traveled up the mound, where a small tree scraped against the undercarriage of V1 before the vehicle came to final rest. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 19-year-old male, was on his way to his girlfriend's house. The front seat passenger stated that the driver and the second row passenger where "Huffing" a compressed inhalant from a can of keyboard dusting spray, when the driver passed out and the car drifted off the road to the right. The passenger stated that he tried to wake the driver and when the driver woke he turned the steering wheel hard to the left and lost control. The driver stated that he didn't remember what happened, but stated that he did remember a black truck. No evidence of another vehicle was found and the driver was charged with reckless driving. The driver and the passenger in the front right seat were uninjured but the passenger in the rear seat was transported for treatment of non-incapacitating injuries.
