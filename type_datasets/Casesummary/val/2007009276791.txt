The crash occurred in the intersection of an undivided 4-lane roadway and an entrance to an army base. There were two eastbound and two westbound lanes. In the eastbound direction, lane two was a left turn-only lane to enter the base. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). It was the early morning on a weekday. The roads were dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was moderate.
V1, a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder utility vehicle with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane 2, attempting to make a left turn. V2, a 1999 Chevy Malibu 4-door with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V1 made a left turn and struck V2 on the left side. After impact, V2 rotated 45 degrees, struck a curb, crossed over a 12m wide grass median, and then came to final rest in the entrance to the base, facing south. V1 came to a rest at the point of impact, facing northeast. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the 1999 Pathfinder, was driven by a 50-year old male who reported no injuries. He stated that he was attempting to turn into the base but the sun was in his eyes. He said as he was turning he felt the impact and heard the sound of a car crash. He did not stop prior to initiating his turn. He did not see V2 prior to impact.
V2, the 1999 Chevy Malibu, was driven by a 55-year old male who was transported due to injuries. Upon reaching the driver, he stated that he would not be speaking to anyone unless his attorney approved. His attorney was contacted and an interview was denied due to litigation. The attorney also stated that his client could not speak because there was a major mistake on the accident report. He said he could not comment on what the mistake was and that it would take about a month or more to fix it.
