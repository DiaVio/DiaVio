This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekend afternoon. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a five-lane, two-way, bituminous, east-west roadway during heavily congested traffic. The speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) in both directions, and a two-way left turn lane separated eastbound from westbound traffic. There are private residential driveways along both sides of the road, and a T-intersection with a north-south roadway intersects the north curb line, just west of the crash scene. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions or roadway defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1992 Toyota Previa minivan, was stopped facing eastbound in the two-way left turn lane, having previously attempted to turn left from southbound traffic at the nearby T-intersection. V1 was unable to complete the turn due to congested traffic, and was waiting in the two-way left turn lane to merge into eastbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was exiting a private driveway at the south curb, and was attempting to turn left into westbound traffic. As V2 turned, the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway near impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
