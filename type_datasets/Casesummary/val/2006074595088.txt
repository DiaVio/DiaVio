This two-vehicle crash occurred in a four-leg intersection, controlled by a traffic signal. The north/south roadway was three lanes - one lane in each direction and a left-turn lane. This roadway curves slightly to the right for the southbound traffic. The east/west roadway is straight and divided by a curbed median. The eastbound lanes consist of two through lanes and a left turn lane. The speed limit for both roadways is 72 kmph (45 mph). The weather at the time of the crash was cloudy and sleeting and the roadways were wet. This crash occurred during daylight hours.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevrolet K2500 pickup, was southbound in the right lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Honda Civic coupe, was eastbound in lane two. The traffic signal was green for southbound traffic. In the intersection, the front of V1 struck the front left side of V2. The vehicles rotated and the back left side of V1 struck the right side of V2. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing southwest, south of the intersection in the northbound lane. V2 rotated counterclockwise and traveled off the southeast corner of the intersection. V2 rolled over four quarter-turns to the right, with the right side striking two small posts and the top striking a small tree. V2 came to rest on its wheels facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
