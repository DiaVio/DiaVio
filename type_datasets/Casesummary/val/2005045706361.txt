The crash occurred on an east/west two-lane, two-way road at a rear driveway to a grocery store parking lot. The roadway was straight and level while the parking lot driveway had a 6.25 percent grade for exiting traffic. Conditions were daylight and dry in the early evening hours on a weekday. The posted speed limit on the east/west road was 48kmph/30mph.
Vehicle#1, a 1987 Nissan Pathfinder, was stopped facing north in the parking lot driveway when a non-contact vehicle passed from its left (west) to right (east). Vehicle #2, a 2005 Dodge Neon, was stopped in the westbound lane waiting for traffic to clear so that its driver could turn left into the parking lot. As soon as the non-contact vehicle had passed, Vehicle #1 proceeded to turn left intending to head west on the road. Vehicle #2 also went ahead with its left turn into the lot and was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle #1. Both vehicles came to rest within a few meters of impact. Vehicle #1 was driven from the scene and Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
