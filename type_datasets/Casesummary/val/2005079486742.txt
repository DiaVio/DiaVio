This single vehicle crash occurred on a Tuesday at mid-afternoon. The crash occurred on a seven lane physically divided roadway with a curbed median without a positive barrier. The roadway is comprised of asphalt and was dry at the time. The roadway speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph). A tri-light controlled, four-leg intersection was also part of the pre-crash roadway. Just south of the intersection there is a 2.4 % down hill grade. The roadway also has a slight curve to the right starting just before the intersection.
Vehicle one (V1) is a 1996 Ford Crown Victoria four-door sedan traveling south in the number one lane. As V1 passed through the intersection it veered to the right and the right side tires departed the roadway. The vehicle then returned to the roadway as it initiated a sweeping left turn, mounted the curbed median, crossed the four northbound lanes, mounted the sidewalk before the front struck a retaining wall on the east side of the road where it came to rest. The driver, a 59 year old male, was transported and the vehicle was towed. A witness following V1 indicated the driver was slumped over on the passenger seat prior to the initial road departure. After the crash the driver was discovered passed out across the front seat of the vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
