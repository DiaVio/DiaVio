The crash occurred on a two way, two-lane tertiary arterial road that ran north/south where it was intersected on the west by a residential side street. The arterial was straight with a negative grade measured at 3 percent southbound and had a speed limit of 48 kmph/30 mph. The residential street was straight with a negative 5.8 percent grade at the stop line. This road ended at the arterial road in the eastbound direction and was controlled by a stop sign. There was a fire hydrant and a large tree in the yard that was on the southwest corner of the intersection. The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekday with no adverse weather conditions.
V1 was a 2005 Ford Taurus 4-door that was making a right (south) turn from the residential side street onto the arterial when it was struck on the left side by the front of V2, a 1995 Nissan Altima 4-door that was traveling south on the arterial. V2 then came to rest a few meters south of impact, oriented southeast straddling lanes one and two. After impact, V1 rotated clockwise and departed the right side of the arterial contacting a fire hydrant with its right side, then finally contacting a tree with its front right and coming to rest facing southwest off the edge of the right side of the road. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
