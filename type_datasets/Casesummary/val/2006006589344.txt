This two-vehicle crash occurred just past an urban three-way intersection on a one-way southbound roadway in the afternoon of a weekday. The one-way roadway consisted of one lane flanked by curbside parking lanes. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight and level with a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a hit and run unknown passenger type vehicle, was southbound on the one-way roadway behind V2, a 2003 Dodge Stratus. As V1 passed through the intersection it attempted to pass V2 and contacted V2's left side with its front right corner. After the initial impact, vehicle two rotated slightly counter-clockwise and traveled forward several meters before coming to final rest facing south. V1, after the impact, continued traveling southbound and fled the scene. The damages to V1 are unknown. V2 was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
No further information could be obtained regarding either V1 or its driver making an interview impossible.
The driver of V2, a 70-year old female, said she was traveling southbound on the one-way wide roadway approached the intersection and stopped for the stop signs posted at the intersection. As she began to accelerate she noticed a passenger car being driven by a young male trying to pass her on the left side and as he did the front of his vehicle hit the left side of her vehicle. She said vehicle one was traveling very fast and was sure he didn't stopped for the sop sign. She tried to slow down when she realized what the vehicle was attempting to do but it was too late. Her tire jammed and the vehicle came to a sudden stop. She was uninjured in the crash.
