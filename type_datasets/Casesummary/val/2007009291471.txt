The crash occurred in the eastbound lane two of a four-lane roadway divided by double yellow lines (two lanes in each direction) at an intersection with a business driveway. This was a straight, level, bituminous road; the posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The east/west roadway had no traffic control device, while the business driveway was controlled by a stop sign. It was a mid-afternoon on a weekday, the road was dry and the sky was clear with light clouds. Traffic was moderate in this shopping area.
V1, a 2000 Ford F-150 pick-up truck, was driven by a 22-year-old male who was traveling with a 19-year-old male passenger. The driver had just left a store and was attempting to make a right turn out of the parking lot on his way home. A bus that was loading passengers was stopped in lane one east of the driveway. The driver of V1 pulled into lane one and partially into lane two, intending to turn right, when he saw V2 advancing in his direction, in lane two, at a high rate of speed. The driver of V1 thought the driver of V2 would slow to let him through. When he saw that V2 was not slowing he claimed that he attempted, unsuccessfully, to reverse. V2 struck the left front side of V1 with the front right side of V2. The driver and passenger were not transported for injuries although the driver stated that the impact to the left side of his head had made him dizzy. The driver did appear disoriented. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2004 Toyota 4-Runner sport utility vehicle, was driven by a 60-year-old male traveling east in lane two with his 37-year-old son. He stated that he had just left a fast-food restaurant on his way home when the accident occurred. The driver stated that he never saw V1 prior to the crash and therefore took no evasive actions. Neither occupant was injured.
A witness standing behind V1 facing north stated that V1 was stopped on the left side (entrance) of the driveway prior to entering the roadway. He saw V2 traveling east in lane two at 56 kmph (35 mph) when V1 entered the roadway attempting a right turn, across lane one, into lane two when the crash occurred. The witness did not see either vehicle attempt avoidance maneuvers. The witness was very hostile toward the driver of V1, stating that the driver had been drinking in the store (although there was no alcohol sold in the vicinity) and was probably drunk. The police did not test for drugs or alcohol. The witness was also hostile to the researcher and tried to goad the driver of V1 into a fight, forcing the police to intervene.
Evidence of the crash supports the conclusion that V1 was exiting the driveway from lane one (the correct lane).
