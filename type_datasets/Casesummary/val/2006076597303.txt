This two-vehicle crash occurred in the late afternoon in the four-legged intersection of two roadways. The north/south roadway is divided by a dirt/grass median. The southbound lanes are straight and downhill and consist of two through lanes and turn lanes on both sides. The east/west roadway is straight, level, undivided and consists of one lane in each direction as it crosses the intersection. There is a stop sign for the westbound traffic at the northbound lanes and another stop sign at the southbound lanes. The speed limit for the southbound traffic is 105 kmph (65 mph) and the speed limit for the westbound traffic is 40 kmph (25 mph). Warning signs for the upcoming stop signs and speed reduction signs were posted on the westbound roadway prior to this junction. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet pickup, was westbound, crossing straight through the intersection and did not stop at either stop sign. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Lexus GS300, was southbound in lane two. In the intersection, the front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise and rolled over to the right side as it departed the southwest corner of the intersection. The top of V1 struck a signpost, V1 rolled over on to its top and came to rest facing east. V2 rotated clockwise and came to final rest off the southwest corner of the intersection facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a sixty-five-year-old female, refused the interview for this study. This driver later revealed that she did not remember the crash, but admitted that she was "having personal thoughts/daydreaming/thinking" and was "distracted by (unspecified) pedestrian/animal/object outside the car." Her BAC at the hospital following this crash was 0.011.
The driver of V2, a fifty-seven-year-old female, was traveling from her summer cabin to her home. She was well rested and familiar with her route and her vehicle. She was attentive to her driving and noticed V1 as it was approaching the intersection. She applied the brakes as she realized that V1 was not stopping for the stop signs.
