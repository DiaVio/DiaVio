This two-vehicle crash occurred during the late morning hours of a weekday. The crash took place at a four-way intersection within an urban roadway. The east/west roadway was undivided with one lane of travel in both directions. There was an additional 'left turn only' lane in the eastbound direction at the intersection, which was available for traffic turning onto the northbound roadway. The east/west roadway also included a bike lane and a parking shoulder. The posted speed limit for this particular roadway was 48 kmph (30 mph). The intersecting northbound roadway was a one-way street with one lane of travel. Parking was allocated on both the left and right hand side of the travel lane. A stop sign controlled northbound traffic at the intersection, while the east/west roadway had no traffic control device. The posted speed limit on this roadway was 40 kmph (25 mph). The surface-type for both roadways was that of bituminous asphalt. Both roadways were wet and both had a positive grade. There were no indications of any physical damage. The weather was cloudy with on-and-off rain drizzle.
Vehicle one, a 1992 Cadillac Seville 4-door sedan, was traveling north on the northbound roadway. The driver came to a stop at the stop sign and looked both ways. Seeing no approaching vehicles, the driver of V1 pulled forward into the intersection where the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2, a 1992 Nissan Maxima 4-door sedan, which had been traveling westbound. Following this impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 130 degrees and came to final rest facing south, with the back right tire of V2 on the edge of the northwest curb and the back left tire on the sidewalk. V2 sustained moderate damage and had to be towed away from the scene. No airbags were deployed. V1 came to final rest parallel to the right side of V2. The driver then proceeded to drive onto the sidewalk where it was later towed due to fluids leaking from the engine bay. Neither driver was injured. Neither vehicle had any other occupants. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
The driver of V1, a retired 79 year-old male suffering from high blood pressure, reported that he was on his way to the racetrack from his house when the crash occurred. The scene of the accident was approximately five miles away from his home and his destination was another six miles away. The driver stated that he came to the stop sign at the intersection and checked for traffic to clear for him to proceed on through. When asked how long he was stopped, the driver replied "not too long." The driver proceeded into intersection and initially stated he did not see V2, but when he did, he attempted to swerve left "real sharp." He related that he remembered hearing his own tires screeching when doing so. When asked how fast he was traveling, the driver was unsure, but was adamant about "doing the speed limit." Although the driver was familiar with the area, he noted this was the first time he has been on this particular street. He had been driving for over fifty-five years.
The driver of V2 was a work-disabled 33 year-old female who had difficulty sleeping and suffers from high blood pressure. She reported that she was on her way to purchase a money order when the crash occurred. The scene of the accident was approximately less than a mile away from her home and her destination was stated to be approximately "three to five miles up the street." The driver reported traveling westbound, going straight, when she saw V1 "coming out of nowhere" from her left side. She stated, "He didn't want to stop." She attempted to avoid V1 by applying her brakes and steering to the right. The driver went on to say that after she was struck, her vehicle began to spin and she could not do anything to compensate. The driver said she was doing the speed limit on a roadway that she drove on a daily basis.
