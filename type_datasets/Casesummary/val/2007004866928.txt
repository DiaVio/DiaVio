The crash occurred off the roadway at the intersection of a "jug handle" and a northbound two lane roadway. The roadway was bituminous and level, a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The "jug handle" had no posted speed limit. It was dusk on a weekend. The road was dry. Traffic flow was light.
V1, a 2001 Honda Accord with two occupants, was negotiating the "jug handle" when it mounted the curb, crossed the northbound lanes and departed the roadway to the left. At that the driver attempted to stop her car by applying the brakes, but applied the accelerator instead. V1 accelerated out of control impacting a guide wire and then continuing forward until it struck a tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a 22-year-old female and occupied by a 55-year-old male. Driver reported a complaint of pain and the passenger was uninjured. Neither was transported to the hospital. The driver said that she was going around the curve and suddenly felt a "bump", and when she drove off the road she tried to hit the brakes, but the car just took off, causing her to hit a wire and a tree. The driver stated that she and her passenger were coming from visiting a sick friend and it was on her mind as she drove home.
