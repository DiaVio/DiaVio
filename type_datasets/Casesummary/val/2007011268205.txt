The crash occurred on a fully controlled highway with two lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median with a posted speed limit of 113 kmh (70 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday evening crash were dark, cloudy and the bituminous road was dry.
V1, a 2002 Toyota Celica GT 2 door hatchback driven by a 20 year-old female, was eastbound on the road in lane two negotiating a curve to the right traveling at 75 mph (120 kmh). The driver stated that the vehicle drifted to the left just onto the paved shoulder. The driver steered back to the right, overcorrected and steered back to the left when she saw a semi truck in the right lane next to her. The driver stated that v1 crossed the left shoulder, entered the snow covered, grassy median rotating counterclockwise. V1 went down a slope, crossed the median, went up a slope and entered the westbound lanes with the rear of v1 leading. The back of v1 struck v2 in the left side in lane one of the westbound lanes. V1 rotated clockwise and re-entered the median and came to rest facing southeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver denied injuries at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2002 Chrysler Pacifica sports utility vehicle, driven by a 29 year-old male was westbound on the highway in lane two. The adult female front right passenger stated that v2 was traveling about 55 mph when v1 came through the median. The driver of v2 braked (with full ABS application) and steered right attempting to avoid v1. The back of v1 struck the left side of v2 in lane one. V2 went off of the roadway to the right, rotated counterclockwise and came to rest off of the road facing southwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. All of the fully restrained occupants of v2 denied injuries, including the 32 year-old female in the front right, the 7 year-old female in the second row left, and the 2 year-old male in the center of the second seat.
