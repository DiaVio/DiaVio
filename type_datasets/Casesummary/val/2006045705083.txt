The crash occurred on a secondary arterial road that was two way, had two lanes and was straight and level and ran east/west. There was a residential cross street at the crash location. The arterial road did not have shoulders. There were no traffic controls for the arterial road other than caution signs for several pedestrian crossings nearby. The speed limit on the arterial was 72kmph (45mph). Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry late on a weekday morning.
Vehicle #1 was a 1992 Lexus ES300 traveling west on the arterial road. Vehicle #2 was a 1989 Ford Ranger traveling east on the arterial road. As Vehicle #1 approached the cross street it came upon a vehicle (non-contact) stopped in the westbound travel lane apparently waiting to turn left onto the residential side street. Vehicle #1 could not stop before striking the vehicle so it swerved to its left and struck Vehicle #2 with its front to Vehicle #2's left side in the eastbound lane. Vehicle #1 then rotated counter clockwise and came to rest facing south in the eastbound travel lane. Vehicle #2 departed the right side of the road while beginning a counter clockwise yaw where it tripped in soft turf and rolled to its right 4 quarter turns and came to rest upright facing north after about a twenty meter roll. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1, was driven by a19 year-old belted male whose airbags did deploy. He stated that he was heading west and came up on an Explorer or some SUV stopped waiting to turn left. The Explorer/SUV didn't have any brake lights on. He swerved left to try and avoid him but he couldn't see the pick-up (V2) in the other lane coming toward him. he hit V2 and V2 rolled. He stopped at the corner. The driver of V2 must have been drunk because he didn't want to go to the hospital. He was transported to a local hospital for treatment of possible injuries. His belted, 18 year-old wife who was in the right front seating position was uninjured. The driver of Vehicle #1 was on his way to take his wife to a job interview that according to its location and her appointment time and the time of the crash they were running pretty tight on time.
Vehicle #2, was driven by a belted 43 year-old male who refused treatment for possible injuries at the crash scene. He stated he was eastbound when he saw the Lexus (V1) heading west and he looked like he was doing 113 or 129 kmph (70 or 80 mph). There was a vehicle stopped waiting for me to pass so he could turn left across my lane. The kid in the Lexus must not have been able to stop in time because he decided to go around the stopped vehicle and when he swerved around he could only steer to his right before he hit me. Then I rolled 2 times.
