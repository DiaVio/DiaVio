This crash occurred early in the evening during dark hours on a two-way, four lane (seven overall), divided roadway without a positive barrier and a private drive. The road was dry, traveled concrete with a -4.1% grade. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (40 mph). There were no adverse weather conditions. The roadway is lighted.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Peterbilt tractor pulling a flatbed trailer, was driven by a 42 year-old male. V1 was making a u-turn from the northbound lanes to the southbound lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a Plymouth Voyager mini van driven by a 31 year-old female with two child passengers, was northbound in the second travel lane. The front of V2 struck the rear of the trailer. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the intersection under the trailer of V1. V1 did not move from from the area of impact. There was no scene evidence to indicate that the driver V 2 made any attempt to avoid the collision. V1's trailer had no red/white reflective tape on the side of it, although it did have several yellow reflective side markers. The trailers lack of conspicuity was considered a factor. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
