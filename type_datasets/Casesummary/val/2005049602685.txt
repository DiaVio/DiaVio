The crash happened mid-morning involving one passenger car and one van on a divided roadway with a raised median. The speed limit on the roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph) The road surface concrete dry and there was no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. The roadway alignment prior to the crash site consists of a slight left-curvature. The roadway has a 6 % uphill slope prior to the crash site.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Saturn Sl, was stopped in the third lane of a four- lane divided (no positive barrier) roadway. V1 was about to make a left turn into the entrance of an apartment complex located east of the northbound travel lanes. V1 was facing south. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford Econoline Van, was traveling south in the same lane. V2's front impacted the rear of V1. V1 rotated clockwise and moved south. V1 crossed all three southbound travel lanes and departed the roadway to the west. The front left corner of V1 impacted a low brick wall located west of the roadway. V1 came to rest at the brick wall. V2 came to rest near the original impact area. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Both vehicles traveled on a left curve uphill road prior to the crash. V2's driver could not provide an accurate estimate how far V1 was ahead of him, but there were no following too close factors involved. It is unlikely the elevation of the roadway was a factor for the driver of V2 to recognize V1 too late. V1 slowed down to a stop prior to the crash. The driver of V2 stated he was going around 72 kmph (45 mph) in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone. V2 was used as a delivery van. The van was used as a delivery van by a flower delivery service. The cargo consisted of flower pots in a Styrofoam carrier. The cargo shifted forward but had insignificant weight, about 23 kg's (50 lbs). For coding purposes this was insufficient weight to be considered as cargo.
