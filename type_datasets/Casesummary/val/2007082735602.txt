Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Dodge Ram pickup driven by a thirty nine (39) year old male, was headed northbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid sedan driven by a forty four (44) year old female, was headed westbound in lane one. V2 was coming downhill approaching the intersection and braking for a red light. The driver of V2 noted there was a vehicle in lane 2 stopped for the red light. The driver of V1 was headed northbound in lane three while looking for road signs to orientate himself. The driver of V1 proceeded through the light, which was more than likely red and impacted V2.

The driver of V1 was not transported to a hospital; the driver of V2 was transported to a hospital. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
