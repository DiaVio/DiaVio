V1, the Honda Accord, was driven by a belted 19-year-old female who was transported, treated and released for a minor laceration. The belted 15-year-old right rear seat passenger was not injured. The driver stated that she was stopped, looking both ways in an attempt to exit the parking lot and there was "lots" of traffic. She saw a van coming out of a driveway two houses down. She did not see the van pull out of the driveway so she attempted to exit and was hit. She did not see V2 and did not have a chance to make any avoidance maneuvers. She was on her way to drop off her dog at the kennel and was not in a hurry. She stated she was in good health and took no medications.

The driver stated that he was on his way from home to his son's riding lesson. He was traveling approximately 31-40 mph and there was heavy traffic, with cars coming in and out of driveways. He observed V1 as he approached the driveway. He stated, "She must have stomped on the pedal to pull out, cause all of a sudden she was in front of me." He attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, but was unable to. He stated he was in good health, wore glasses for a myopic (near-sighted condition) and took no medications.
