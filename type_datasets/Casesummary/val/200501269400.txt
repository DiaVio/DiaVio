V1, a 2000 Pontiac Montana minivan, made a left turn from a private driveway onto a northbound 5-lane two-way, dry asphalt roadway on a downhill grade. The posted speed limit on this roadway was 80 kmph (50 MPH). V1 entered the roadway by crossing over the two southbound lanes and then entering the third northbound lane, which was a left turn-only lane at a 4-way intersection. The driver of V1 intended to travel straight through the intersection, and so he began to change lanes to the right. He did not see V2, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, that was traveling in the second northbound lane. The northbound roadway had curved to the right prior to the private driveway that V1 had exited. As V1 began to change lanes to the right, the front of V1 contacted the left rear of V2 before coming to final rest on the roadway.
The driver of V1 was a 60-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 2-17 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash. He had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash. He was rested and traveling back home. He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (nearsighted) condition. He did not sustain any injuries from the crash and refused treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V2 was a 28-year old woman who reported that she had been traveling between 66-80 kmph (41-50 mph) prior to the crash. She had no health-related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash. She was rested and on her way home. She does not wear corrective lenses. She sustained minor injuries and was transported to a local trauma facility.
