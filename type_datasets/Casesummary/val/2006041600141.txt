This crash occurred in the evening of weekday on the right roadside of a two-lane, two-way residential street. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction and a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2000 Ford Explorer, was stopped at a stop sign on a side street intending to turn right (north) onto the two-lane roadway. As V1 turned it cut the corner short and sideswiped a utility pole. After striking the utility pole it continued northbound out of control and struck a large tree. V1 came to final rest against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 49 year-old woman who was driving home from the grocery store. She claimed that a â€œvehicle with tinted windows swerved into her lane causing her to swerve off the roadway to the right into a tree. This story was very doubtful as the woman seemed inebriated and her speech was slurred. The police on scene made the woman stay in her vehicle because when she attempted to get out she almost fell twice. A witness saw the driver attempt to make a right turn and stated that he never saw the other vehicle that the driver of V1 described. He did state that he saw the driver attempt a right hand turn, hit a telephone pole, and then drive off the roadway to make contact with the tree. The physical evidence on scene support the witness's statement. Fire rescue responded to the scene but she refused treatment and V1 was towed due to damages
