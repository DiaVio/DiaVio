The crash occurred at the intersection of a one-way exit ramp from a fully controlled highway and a two-way roadway divided by a curbed median with two lanes in each direction, with a posted speed limit of 48 kph (30 mph). V1 was traveling on the two-lane road and v2 was exiting the highway on the ramp and the intersection was controlled by an on-colors traffic signal. Conditions at the time of the weekday morning crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 1995 Chevrolet 1500 pick up truck was driven by a 46 year-old male northbound on the road in lane two. The driver disregarded the red traffic signal and entered the intersection. The front of v1 struck the left side of v2. The miscellaneous cargo in the bed of the truck included a dishwasher, which broke the backlight during the impact. V1 came to rest in the intersection facing northwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver and front right passenger (66 year-old male) were transported from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2004 Chevrolet Express 2500 full size cargo van, was driven by a 48 year-old male. V2 exited a fully controlled highway. V2 was the first vehicle in lane two stopped at the traffic signal at the end of the ramp facing west. The driver stated that he had been stopped for more than 10 seconds and started up when the light turned green. Traffic was backed up in lane one of the northbound traffic, so the driver of v2 did not see v1 until just prior to impact. The driver stated that when he saw v1 on his left coming through the intersection, he accelerated in an attempt to avoid the crash. Following the impact v2 came to rest facing southwest. V2 was drivable after the impact. The fully restrained driver denied injuries at the scene.
