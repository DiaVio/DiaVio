The crash happened just past noon. The location was a four lane undivided (one-way traffic, highway service road) uphill roadway. Involved one pick-up truck, speed limit 64 kmph (40 mph). Intersection controlled by traffic signal. Road surface dry concrete.
The only vehicle in this crash, a 1998 Dodge Ram driven by a 27 year-old male was traveling east in the third lane of the roadway. This was a left turn only lane. Lane # 2 was a left-turn/straight only lane. The driver was trying to go straight instead of turning left. He did not realize the lane to his right was a left turn lane as well. The vehicle in lane two intended to turn left. The driver of this vehicle realized V 1 going straight instead of turning left. The driver honked his horn and steered to the right to avoid a possible collision. This vehicle did not collide with V 1. The driver went straight to the intersection and stopped on the side of the roadway. V 1 drove to the left to avoid a collision. It departed the roadway to its left. Its front impacted with a light pole, located on the east side of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V 1 came to rest at the pole. The vehicle was towed from the scene. The driver was treated on location by an EMS unit.
The pre-event movement was coded accelerating in traffic lane, category this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. Critical event driver related factor "illegal maneuver" (disregard turn marks at intersection) The driver was knowingly intending an illegal maneuver by going straight in a left turn only lane. He admitted he did not realize the lane next to him was a left turn lane as well.
There were three signs on the right side of the road as well as a sign on top of the traffic light for eastbound/left turn lanes. All these signs clearly indicated the permitted moving directions for all three lanes. If the driver would have observed these signs prior to proceeding into the intersection, he would have known vehicles in lane 2 do not all travel straight through the intersection at that location.
