The crash occurred in lane two of a two-lane northbound highway where the northbound and southbound lanes were divided by a wide grass and tree covered land strip with a guardrail bordering the northbound lane two. There was a small shoulder on the left side of lane two with a rumble strip. This was a rural area surrounded by farms and forest with a large deer population that can present a hazard to drivers. A gas station/mini mart was sandwiched between the north and southbound lanes with driveway accesses on each side. The northbound highway had two accesses to the gas station/mini mart. The first northbound driveway access was located 287 meters south of the crash site south; the second driveway access was located at the crash site, and that particular access was available for the northbound traffic only. The posted speed was 89 kmph (55 mph) on this dry, straight highway with a 2.5 percent downhill slope in the northbound direction. Traffic was moderately busy during the mid-morning commuting hours on a weekday.
V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Colorado compact pickup truck, was driven by a 60 year-old male. The driver stated that he had left the mini mart, intending to exit from the driveway for the southbound traffic; he inadvertently exited the first driveway for the northbound traffic. Upon exiting the first driveway, the driver of V1 entered lane one heading north at a rate of 72 kmph (45 mph). Once he discovered the error of his direction, he began checking traffic approaching from the rear, using the vehicle's side mirrors. Intending to make a U-turn at the next crossover, he used his left indicator to signal his intentions to change lanes to the left, and again checked his side mirrors prior to the lane change. As V1 neared the second driveway of the mini mart, the driver of V1 crossed from lane one over to lane two. Unfortunately, an unseen vehicle (V2) traveling north in lane two at the same rate of speed as V1 was positioned slightly left and back from V1. Crossing over into lane two, V1 was immediately struck in the left side driver's door with the front right portion of the other vehicle (V2). The force of the crash caused V1 to spin clockwise, and the left rear portion of V1 struck the left rear portion of V2. The rear side slap caused V1 to spin counterclockwise west across lane two, crashing the front of V2 into the guardrail, coming to rest facing west. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 2006 Lincoln Navigator utility vehicle, was driven by a 45 year-old male. The driver stated that he was on his way to meet a client, having just left his office when the crash occurred. He was traveling north in lane two when he noticed V1 traveling at the same rate of speed and slightly ahead of his vehicle in lane one. He only noticed V1 when its brake lights came on. Thinking the driver of V1 was slowing for an approaching deer, the driver of V1 also applied his brakes and prepared to veer left in case V1 made a sudden avoidance maneuver. The driver of V2 did not have time to avoid a collision with V1 due to V1's sudden lane change. After crashing into V1, V2 continued traveling north across lane two, onto the left shoulder, sideswiping the guardrail with the left side of V2 before coming to rest 130 meters north of the crash site facing north.
