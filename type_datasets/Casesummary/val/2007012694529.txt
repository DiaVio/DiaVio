As vehicle #1, a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt drove north in lane one the driver had noticed a small Chevrolet S-10 pick-up truck moving in and out of traffic from lane to lane in his rear view mirror. As the pick-up traveled at a high rate of speed from lane to lane it came along side of V1 the driver noted the driver had on a red headband. The pick-up moved to the right pushing V1 off onto the shoulder of the roadway. The driver of V1 had made a successful avoidance maneuver from the S-10 pick-up but as V1 moved onto the shoulder the asphalt was in poor condition and braking up. The poor condition caused the driver to loss control and rotate counter clockwise. The driver then counter steered and re-entered the roadway sliding across the roadway and off into the median to contact a guardrail barrier for the overpass with the right front of the vehicle. Then rotating to contact the right rear of the vehicle and rotate to face north along the guardrail for final rest. The driver was not injured in the crash but the vehicle had to be towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
