This crash occurred on a weekday morning on a four-lane divided highway. The north/south highway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median and guardrail. The bituminous roadway curved to the right (radius of curvature 563m, superelevation 2.5%) with a positive slope in the southbound direction and a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The roadway was wet from a light rain and fog that was present at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Jeep Cherokee with two occupants, was southbound in lane two negotiating the curve. V1 drifted left partially departing the roadway, driving over the rumble strip. The driver of V1 steered hard right and overcorrected, causing the vehicle to roll leftt four-quarter turns. V1 came to final rest on its wheels facing south, on the paved shoulder. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a belted 53-year-old female, could not be located. Little information is known about her, as a Police Accident Report could not be obtained for this crash. A belted 55-year-old male passenger (the driver's husband) told this researcher on-scene that he had been reading a newspaper and did not know why the vehicle originally drifted left. Repeated requests for an interview with the driver proved futile.
