This is a two-vehicle crash that occurred during morning daylight hours on a two-way, five lane, dry asphalt roadway. The roadway consists of two westbound and two eastbound lanes that are separated by a continuous left turn lane. There is a designated right turn lane for westbound traffic used to enter the Police Department police vehicle parking area. The speed limit on the roadway where the crash occurred is posted 56 kmph (35 mph). There were no environmental factors or sight line restrictions that contributed to this crash. This crash is intersection related.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Chevrolet Lumina 4 door, was traveling eastbound in the #2 lane and stopped for the traffic light. The vehicle was stopped for about 20 seconds and then entered the left turn lane to turn left at the intersection. The left rear area of V1 struck the right front area of vehicle two (V2). V1 then made a U-turn and stopped in the dedicated right turn westbound lane. The driver of V1, an 18-year old male with one passenger, stated that he looked in his rear view mirror prior and saw V2 in the left turn lane behind him. The driver then looked straight ahead and then to his left and entered the left turn and struck V2. The driver stated that he thought he had enough room to change lanes when he saw V2 approaching from the rear. The vehicle was removed from the scene on it's own power. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
V2, a 2004 Nissan Altima 4 door, was traveling eastbound and had changed from the number two lane to the number three left turn lane at approximately 24-32 kmph (15-20 mph). The driver's objective was to turn left at the intersection ahead. V1 then traveled into the left turn lane and the left side of V1 impacted with the front area of V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest in the left turn lane facing in an easterly direction. The vehicle was towed from the scene.
