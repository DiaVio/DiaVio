This single-vehicle crash occurred in the early evening of weekday on the roadside just east of a two-way intersection. The intersection consisted of a one-way eastbound lane, and a one-way northbound lane. All roads were bituminous, dry, straight, and level with posted speed limits of 56kmph (35 mph). Signalized traffic devices controlled both directions. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1985 Oldsmobile Delta 88, was eastbound on the one-way roadway approaching the intersection. As it entered the intersection without the right-of-way it veered right, and departed the roadway. V1's front contacted a building located on the southeast corner of the intersection. After the initial contact, V1, rotated slightly clockwise where its left side contacted a pole located on the same curb. V1 came to final rest a couple feet away from the wall. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a male, was said by a witness to have stayed in the vehicle for several minutes and then left the scene on foot. Therefore, an interview was not possible. The witness interviewed on scene said that the driver was speeding through the intersection, approximately 80kmph (50 mph), and for some unknown reason departed the roadway and hit the wall. The witness was traveling north and stopped just short of the intersection intending to make a u-turn which gave him a clear view of the entire motion of V1 before and after it hit the wall.
