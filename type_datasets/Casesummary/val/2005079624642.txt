This two-vehicle collision occurred during dusk hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the four-leg intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The traffic at this intersection is controlled by a tri-light signal without a protected left phase. Both roadways are designated 56 kmph (35 mph) zones. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Volvo S40 four-door sedan, was traveling southbound in the third lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, and was stopped in the middle of the intersection awaiting an opportunity to turn left into eastbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Toyota Camry four-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the second lane of opposing traffic, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V1 made its turn, the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2 deflected right and departed the road over the northeast corner, where the front of V1 impacted a signal-light pole, bringing the vehicle to rest. V1 came to rest facing east in the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
