This crash occurred in the late afternoon of a weekday on an exit ramp of an interstate highway. The exit ramp consisted of one westbound lane that curved to the right and was flanked by paved shoulders and grassy embankments. The interstate highway had a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph) but the exit ramp had an advisory speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). The bituminous roadway was wet from a rain that was falling at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2003 Dodge Ram truck with one occupant was exiting the interstate via the curved exit ramp. As V1 exited the interstate and began negotiating the curve it failed to slow down and V1 began to hydroplane on the wet roads. The driver of V1 steered left and shifted the vehicle into neutral. V1 began rotating counter-clockwise and departed the roadway to the left. V1 continued rotating down the embankment until its left side wheels stuck in the soft ground. V1 rolled left one-quarter turn and came to final rest on its left side approximately 12m (40 ft.) off the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
The driver of V1, a 26-year-old male, was not injured in the crash. He claimed to be on his way from school to a barbershop and rarely drove this way. He had just put new tires on the front of his vehicle but the rear tires were old. He stated that he steered hard left and than took his foot off the gas and put his vehicle in neutral as it began to hydroplane.
