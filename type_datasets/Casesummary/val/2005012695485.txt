This crash occurred at an intersection between two five-lane roads controlled by a three color with traffic signal with left turn arrows. It was a dark but lighted weekday evening and the roadway was wet, level asphalt. The posted speed on the north/south roadway was 72 kmph (45 mph). As V1, a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina, traveled south in it moved from lane 2 to the left turn lane as it approached the intersection. The traffic light had gone from a green turn light to a flashing red light. V1 came to a stop just over the crosswalk lines and waited for a chance to turn. When the light turned from flashing red to a solid red V1 started it's turn. As V1 crossed the northbound lanes of travel it was contacted on the right front side by V2, a 1997 Chevrolet Lumina. V1 then rotated counter-clockwise coming to final rest facing northwest straddling lanes 1 and 2 of the northbound lanes. V2 after contact rotated clockwise coming to final rest facing east in the middle of the intersection. V2 had a fire ignite in the heater core area of the vehicle that was extinguished by a truck driver passing by on a connecting roadway.
V1 was driven by a 72 year-old male that claimed to be in good health despite having had a quadruple bypass (the medication for which this driver feels does not effect his driving) and presently using a CPAP treatment for sleep apnea. He also wears glasses to correct a myopic (near sighted) condition. He had driven two trips out of the area for an auto auction that he works for. He stated after getting gas he was on his way home. He stated that as he drove to the intersection the left turn light had gone from green to red flashing. He stated he stopped just over the crosswalk line and waited for a clearing to turn. He also stated that he did not see the northbound vehicle until after he had started his turn. He stated the vehicle was to close for him to do any avoidance actions. The driver of V1 was transported to an ER unit by POV (son) while V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2 was driven by a 19 year-old female that states she is in good health and was on her way to a basketball game from work with a friend. She stated that as she approached the intersection she saw the vehicle in the left turn lane and at the last minute the vehicle started its turn. She said she applied the brakes and steered right to avoid the crash. After contacting the other vehicle her vehicle rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing the eastbound left turn lane. The driver was helped from her vehicle by passers-by and her and her passenger were transported to a local trauma unit for injuries. V2 was towed due to damage.
