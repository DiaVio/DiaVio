This is a single vehicle crash that occurred on an urban two-lane street with no centerline markings. There is one southbound and one northbound travel lane and no centerline markings. There were no traffic control devices. The posted speed limit is 40 kmph (25 mph). The roadway is constructed of bituminous asphalt with no rumble strips. The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon of a cloudy day.
Vehicle one (V-1), a 2001 Ford Ranger 4x2 pickup with one occupant, was traveling south. The original travel lane is not known. The vehicle was traveling south and the intoxicated driver "blacked out". The vehicle then crossed a sidewalk, struck a fence and continued until it struck a building. The driver did remember being at a gasoline station about seven blocks north and east of the crash site before he "blacked out". His intention was to drive into the driveway of the apartment complex and pick up a friend. He did not drive into the driveway and did not pick up his friend. The vehicle departed the roadway partially in the driveway and partially across the sidewalk. The vehicle continued forward (west), crossed a sidewalk, and struck a wooden fence. A four-meter (13 feet) wide section of the fence was knocked down. The vehicle continued forward across a yard and struck the east wall of an apartment building. V1 was still accelerating when it struck the building and the rear tires dug into the earth at that location until the engine stopped. The unconscious driver was removed and transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1.
The driver was an eighty four year old male who stated he was in fair general health. He said he did not take any medications but did like to start his day with a little vodka in his coffee. He said he required glasses and was wearing them at the time of the crash. His intention was to enter the apartment complex driveway and pick up a friend. The crash occurred before the friend was picked up. The driver was alone at the time of the crash and was using the available lap and shoulder restraint. The medical reported a blood alcohol level (BAC) of 0.30, and stated that he was suffering from acute alcohol intoxication at time of admission. A friend, using a truck and tow bar later the same day, towed V1 for the driver.
