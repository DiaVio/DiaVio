A two vehicle daytime collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday. The collision occurred on the westbound lanes of a west/east roadway, on approach to a traffic light controlled, four-leg intersection. At the time of the collision, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Chevrolet S-10 regular cab pickup, was traveling westbound in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, in the first lane of a seven lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Mercedes E320 four-door sedan, was stopped ahead of V1 in the second lane. As V1 approached the intersection, the driver applied the brakes but the brakes did not function. To avoid a collision, the driver veered right off the road over the raised curb, impacting the curb with the front wheels. On the concrete sidewalk, the front of V1 contacted a small tree in a sideswipe motion, then continued forward and impacted a support wire for a utility pole. V1 rode up the wire and flipped over onto its left side, then to its top. During the rollover, the left side of V1 struck a fire hydrant, and then the front of V1 contacted the utility pole. As V1 was coming to rest (inverted) the back of V1 contacted the right side of V2, causing minor damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
