This one-vehicle fatal crash occurred on a two-lane undivided roadway, during daylight hours. The bituminous roadway had a left curve for vehicles traveling south. The roadway was dry and level with a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55mph). A bisecting roadway did create a T-intersection; however, it was not a part of the crash. There were no traffic control devices associated with this particular stretch of roadway. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Honda Civic 4-door sedan, was traveling south on the roadway negotiating the left curve. The right tires of the vehicle left the roadway and continued for approximately 36 meters before it began to skid laterally in a counterclockwise direction. This was possibly caused by driver overcompensation in an attempt to return to the roadway. As the vehicle continued uncontrollably for approximately 51 meters, it crossed the opposite lane of travel before the first impact with a tree off to the left side of the roadway. The momentum caused the vehicle to continue to rotate counterclockwise when the passenger side of the vehicle contacted two more trees. The vehicle came to final rest off the left side of the roadway facing north, wrapped around the two trees approximately 10 meters from the initial impact. Because of the severity of the impact, the jaws-of-life had to be used to separate the vehicle from the trees before it could be towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 129 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a 30 year-old male, was found ejected from the right side of the vehicle on the ground, and was pronounced dead at the scene due to fatal injuries. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. Because the driver was deceased, an interview could not be obtained. There was no contact number listed on the police report; however, a telephone number was obtained via the Internet. Unfortunately, the number was already disconnected, therefore, a surrogate interview could not be produced.
One witness interview was obtained who relayed that she had observed the other vehicle traveling between 80-90mph as it exited the curve. She said that he was traveling so fast she couldn't even tell if he was talking on a cell phone. She related that the other vehicle was in an uncontrollable skid heading directly towards her. In order to avoid being struck, she stated that she had to accelerate. As she passed the vehicle she looked in her rear-view mirror and saw what had happened.
One side note of importance is the fact that the speed limit on this roadway is 89kmph (55mph). Through information relayed by the owner of the property where the crash occurred, it was revealed that this was not the first fatal crash on this roadway. The owners in fact had just lost their son in the same location a few months back as he was attempting to cross the street on his bike. The property owner was adamant about having the speed limit on this roadway reduced as soon as possible.
