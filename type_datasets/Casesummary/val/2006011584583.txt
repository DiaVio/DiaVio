This crash occurred in the mid-morning of a weekday on a two-lane, two-way undivided roadway. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash as it was clear and sunny.
V1, a 1996 GMC Sonoma pickup, was southbound in lane one traveling at 80kmph (50 mph). As V1 continued southbound it gradually drifted off to the right and exited the roadway. After exiting the roadway to the right, V1 struck a sign and ramped up a small incline which caused the vehicle to begin rolling over. As V1 rolled left (6 quarter turns before final rest) it struck a tree with its front right. As V1 continued to roll it reentered the roadway before coming to final rest on its roof. The driver was injured and transported. V1 was towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
A partial driver interview, from multiple surrogates, was obtained for V1. V1 was driven by a 24 year-old male with a history of depression however he was currently not being treated for it. It is unknown if he was wearing his prescription lenses that corrected a myopic (near-sighted) condition. The driver stated that a tire blew out, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. However evidence at the scene and a later vehicle inspection failed to support that claim. Trajectory evidence indicated that of a driver who had fallen asleep and had taken no evasive actions. The responding police officer on-scene administered a preliminary breath test with a result of .229 for the driver. Traces of THC and cocaine were also found in the driver's system. The driver of V1 was transported with non-incapacitating injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
