The posted speed was 72 kmph (45 mph). The driver of V#1 was driving southbound in lane #1. He stated that he had a clear view of the roadway and noted that the road where he wanted to make a left turn was just ahead. The driver of V#1 then changed lanes to the left and decelerated to a stop. V#2 was traveling southbound in lane #2 on the same roadway and its driver stated that V#1 changed lanes in front of him and suddenly stopped.
