The crash occurred at an intersection of a north/south interstate on/off ramp and a secondary arterial road that ran east/west. The arterial had six lanes (three each direction) and was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 56kph (35mph). The north leg of the intersection was an interstate off ramp that split from one to two lanes (right lane was right turn only and left was straight/left turn) separated by a painted gore. The intersection was controlled by on-colors traffic signals. The speed limit for the off ramp was 48kph (30mph). The off ramp was straight with a slight negative grade (1.6%). Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.
V1 was a 1996 Mack CBE four-axle dump truck with a full load of gravel (estimated by the driver to be a gross weight of 72,000lbs.). V1 was traveling south on the off ramp when as the driver attempted to stop he was unable to do so. Later he said that the brakes felt very spongy. He began blowing his air horn as he approached the intersection and was struck on the left side as he was passing through lane 2, westbound. V2, a 1998 Dodge Dakota 4x2 regular cab pickup was traveling west in lane 2 of the arterial passing through the intersection on a solid green light when its front struck V1's left side. V2 rotated counter clockwise and traveled about 8 meters laterally coming to rest facing southeast in the crossover for the intersection. V1 pulled to the left shoulder on the southbound interstate on-ramp. V2 was towed from the scene and V1 was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 35 year-old belted male who was not injured in the crash. He stated that he was coming down the ramp and noticed that his brakes weren't working, they felt soft. He started pulling his air horn. He couldn't see the left side of the intersection until he was almost in the intersection. He didn't see the pickup (V2) until he was more or less in the intersection with V2 closing in. His truck was loaded out (estimated gross weight to be 72,000 pounds) and he just couldn't believe that he couldn't stop. The driver stated that he is going to get a good, safe factory job after this.
V2 was driven by a 52 year-old belted male whose airbags did deploy and was transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-incapacitating injuries. He stated he was in the left lane going through the intersection when he saw the dump truck (V1) coming across about the same time he heard V1's horn. May have heard the horn a second before they hit if that. The truck had just swerved a bit to its right to avoid a van that was in the right lane about 3 car lengths ahead of him. He didn't have time to do anything but touch his brakes.
