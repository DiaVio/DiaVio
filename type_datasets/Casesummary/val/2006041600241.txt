This crash occurred just after noon on a weekday on the shoulder of the northbound lanes of a high occupancy, high volume, and interstate highway. The highway consisted of five lanes in the northbound direction (with lane five serving as the HOV lane) flanked by paved shoulders and divided by a concrete barrier wall. The bituminous highway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1996 Toyota Avalon, was traveling in lane four going the speed limit, 105kmph. A motorcycle was traveling next to V1 in lane five. The motorcycle cut in front of V1 as it changed lanes into lane four. V1 swerved to avoid the motorcycle and started to lose control, fishtailing across three lanes of traffic until it made contact with the right side concrete barrier wall. After the initial impact V1 rotated clockwise and struck the barrier wall again with left side before coming to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 22-year-old male who was commuting to work. He stated in the interview that as he was driving, a speeding motorcycle in lane five came out of nowhere cut into his lane (lane four). He stated that he “did not want to kill the motorcyclist” so he steered right and hit the brakes to avoid hitting the biker. He was not injured, but V1 was towed due to damage.
