This single-vehicle crash occurred mid-morning on an eight-lane, asphalt, straight, physically divided, wet, uphill, interstate highway. The highway generally runs east/west; however, runs southwest/northeast at this location. Westbound traffic consists of four through lanes. The paved shoulder on the south side of the road contains a rumble strip and has a three-foot cement barrier that separates east and westbound lanes. The speed limit on the highway is 105 kph (65 mph) and it was raining heavily at the time.
Vehicle one, a 1995 Acura Integra GS-R coupe, driven by a 17 year-old male was traveling westbound in lane two. Vehicle one began to rotate counterclockwise due to the wet roads and crossed all lanes of westbound traffic. Vehicle one entered the paved shoulder and its front contacted the cement barrier. It continued counterclockwise and its right side contacted the same barrier. The vehicle separated from the barrier and continued to rotate counterclockwise. Then its back contacted the cement barrier again as it continued to rotate. The front of vehicle one then contacted the barrier. The vehicle separated from the barrier and came to rest facing south in lane four. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
Vehicle one was towed due damage.
