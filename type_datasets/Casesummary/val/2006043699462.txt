This crash occurred just after noon on a weekend on the center median of divided four-lane residential roadway. The roadway consisted of one northbound and two southbound lanes divided by a tree-lined, curbed, grass median and featured a posted speed limit of 88kmph (55 mph). The bituminous northbound lane curved to the right on a 3% uphill grade. Traffic flow was normal and the roadway was wet as it was raining at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1995 Ford Escort station wagon was northbound negotiating the right curve. V1 began losing control and braked heavily. While braking, V1 began rotating counter-clockwise. V1 traveled into the median and struck a tree with its right plane. V1 then continued rotating counter-clockwise before striking a second tree with its left plane. V1 came to final rest against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.
V1 was driven by a 16 year-old female who was transported to a local trauma center with non-incapacitating injuries. Her right front passenger was transported with incapacitating injuries. She was unable to be located for an interview as her mother said the situation was under possible litigation. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 97kmph (60 mph). He also noted that only shoulder belts were used, leading to a higher severity of injuries. The station wagon was towed due to damage.
