As the driver of V1 approached the intersection, she was aware that the children were still buckling their seat belts. It is possible, although denied, that she was focused on them rather than entering the intersection. The driver made her stop as she leaned forward to look for approaching traffic. The driver wanted to ensure that she was looking around any obstructions from buildings. However, her view was not obstructed because she saw V2 approaching. The driver believed V2 was far enough to allow her attempt at a left turn.
