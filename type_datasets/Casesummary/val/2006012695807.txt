This crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a five line, two-way roadway. There were two eastbound and two westbound lanes divided by a two-way left turn lane. This was a straight, level, bituminous, roadway with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45mph). It was mid-afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry but the sky was cloudy.
V1, a 2002 GMC Envoy four door with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V2, a 2000 Dodge Intrepid four door with two occupants, was also traveling westbound in lane one behind V1. A non-contact vehicle stopped suddenly in front of V1. The driver of V1 applied the brakes and successfully avoided the NCV. V2 failed to slow down sufficiently and rear-ended V2.
