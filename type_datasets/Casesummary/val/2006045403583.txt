The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a 6-lane interstate highway divided by a concrete barrier. There were three lanes of dry asphalt roadway in each direction. There were shoulders and rumble strips on each side of the level roadway. The posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred early on a clear dry weekend morning. Traffic was light.
V1, a 2003 Ford F350 pickup truck, had two occupants and was southbound in lane three. An unknown vehicle traveling at a higher rate of speed approached from the right rear of V1, crossing from lane one towards lane 3. V1 veered to the left where it struck the concrete barrier. V1 then veered to the right, spinning in a clockwise rotation across all three lanes. V1 went off the right side of the roadway where it rolled over 2 quarter turns when it hit the soft dirt and grass. The vehicle came to rest on its top with the front facing eastward and the occupants pinned inside. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a 40-year old male who was not injured. V1 was also occupied by a female passenger who had to be cut out of the vehicle. She received non-incapacitating injuries and was transported to a hospital where she was treated and released. V1 had been highly modified with advanced braking, suspension system, horns, two GPS systems, oversized wheels, special bumpers and a custom top for the bed. The driver was traveling from one state to his home in another state and had been driving for about an hour that morning. V1 was southbound in lane three traveling over the speed limit, between 97 and 113 kmph (60 and 70 mph). He said he saw the other vehicle (the non-contact vehicle) but also said his view of the vehicle was obscured by other vehicles in the center lane. The driver said that it appeared that the unknown vehicle was passing him and trying to move into lane three in front of V1. The driver of V1 claimed that the left front of the unknown vehicle struck the right front of V1. The driver of V1 said the impact and his reaction of steering to the left caused him to veer to the left where V1's large wheels scuffed against the concrete barrier. That contact caused V1 to careen to the right where V1 went off the road and rolled over. Witnesses told police they had seen the non-contact vehicle passing V1 and moving to the left but they did not see any contact between V1 and the other vehicle. The researcher inspected V1 and did not find any evidence of contact with another vehicle on its right side or on the right front wheel. The researcher also looked on lane three of the roadway in the path to the tire scuffmarks for skid marks that would have indicated contact between V1 and another vehicle. There were no such marks.
