This crash occurred in the early afternoon of weekday in the northbound lanes of a four-lane divided roadway near a four-way intersection. The roadway consisted of two bituminous lanes in each direction separated by a grass median with a posted speed limit of 80kmph (50 mph). The intersection was controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal and roads were dry, straight, and level. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a Ford 350 series pickup truck, was northbound in lane two approaching the intersection. V2, a 1997 Ford Probe, was also northbound in lane two ahead of V1 and stopped at the intersection (due to a red light). As V1 approached the intersection it failed to stop and struck V2 in the rear. The impact sent V2 spinning clockwise about 180 degrees into the median where it came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a belted 41 year-old male who after several attempts could not be located for an interview. The driver of V1 was uninjured but V1 was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a belted 55 year-old male who was returning to work from his lunch break. He stated that he was stopped at the light when V1 came from behind and hit him. The driver of V2 was transported to the hospital for possible injuries and V2 was towed due to damage.
