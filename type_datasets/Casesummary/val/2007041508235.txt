The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, twelve-lane interstate roadway, which was physically divided by a concrete traffic median. There were six northbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a straight, level, and asphalt roadway. Conditions were dark but lighted, on a weekday evening, with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
A non-contact 1996 Honda Accord with an unknown number of occupants was traveling northbound in lane four. V1, a 2007 Mazda 3 with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane two. V2, an International Harvester 4700 with one occupant, was also traveling northbound in lane two, ahead of V1. The non-contact Honda Accord changed three lanes to the right, squeezing between V1 and V2 in order to get to the exit lane (lane one). In doing so, the non-contact vehicle cut off V1. As a result, the driver of V1 lost control, weaving wildly from side to side. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. The non-contact vehicle continued northbound, leaving the scene of the crash. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
An independent witness to the crash stated that he was driving northbound, staggered behind all three of the involved vehicles. The driver looked on as the Honda Accord suddenly and without warning cut across three travel lanes, in order to make his exit. In doing so, the motorist squeezed between V1 and V2, narrowly missing the back of V2, and completely cutting off V1. When asked, the witness indicated that the Honda did not make physical contact with V1, although it appeared that the action caused V1 to lose control of her vehicle. The witness, who himself had previously been a victim of hit and run, followed the driver off the interstate. The witness confronted the driver at a stoplight, insisting that the motorist return to the crash that he had just caused. According to the witness, the driver apologized, but made no attempt to return to the scene. The witness then obtained a vehicle description and tag number from the vehicle before returning to the scene. The researcher later used this information to contact the vehicle's owner. The owner stated that his vehicle had not been involved in a motor vehicle crash, and agreed to have his vehicle looked at. Evidence from the vehicle inspection suggested that the Honda Accord listed on the police report was a non-contact vehicle.
V2, the International 4700, was driven by a 52-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from work. The driver said that he did not hear or see anything going on behind him. It was late at night, and the interstate was relatively quiet. Suddenly he was hit from behind. The driver did not know how or why the crash happened.
