The east/west roadway upon which vehicles one and two were traveling consisted of four lanes. The posted speed limit on the roadway was 72kmph (45 mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the incident and the roadway was dry.
V1, a 2003 Saturn Vue, was traveling in lane two of the westbound roadway approaching an intersection. V2, a 2004 Ford Explorer, was stopped in lane two of the eastbound roadway, intending to turn left at the intersection. As V1 approached the intersection a non-contact vehicle in front of it began slowing when the traffic light changed from green to amber. V1 changed lanes from lane two to lane one and continued into the intersection. As V2 began its left turn its front made contact with the left side of V1.
