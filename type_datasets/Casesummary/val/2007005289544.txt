This one vehicle crash occurred on a weekend during daylight hours on an undivided two-lane roadway. The bituminous roadway was wet, straight and level. There were no traffic control devices associated with this stretch of roadway. The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, but there had just been a recent heavy downpour. It should be noted that there was a shallow stream of water that stretched the entire width of the roadway, which was caused by a nearby overflowing creek. The stream was located on the roadway just prior to where the crash took place. Because the speed of the vehicle was believed to be below 56kmph (35mph), hydroplaning was not thought to be a factor; however, the flow of traffic was hindered as people cautiously crossed the stream of water.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was heading south on the roadway intending to continue straight. The vehicle departed the right side of the roadway and struck a tree where it came to final rest. The vehicle was privately towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
The driver of V1, a 31 year-old male, suffered unknown injuries and was taken to a medical facility for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained from the driver of this vehicle. He related that he was driving along the roadway and the vehicle in front of him slammed on its brakes suddenly. The driver stated that he tried to avoid the crash by braking himself while steering to the right. Unfortunately, he could not bring his vehicle to a stop before striking a tree off of the right side of the roadway. The driver relayed that he was well rested and was just going over his friend's house to "hang out." He was very familiar with the roadway and had only been driving this portion of the trip for about 15 minutes. The driver stated that he was in good health and was not currently on any medication. The driver also said that his vehicle was in proper working condition and that no mechanical defects contributed to this crash.
