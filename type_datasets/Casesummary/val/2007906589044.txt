This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a three-way intersection. There was one northbound lane intersected by two westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes with the eastbound direction having a northbound turning lane. The east/westbound lanes were non-physically divided; only a wide median with yellow lines divided the lanes. Signalized traffic control devices controlled the movement through the intersection. The bituminous covered roadways were dry, level, and straight, and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for all directions of travel was 40 kmph (25 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday during the early morning daylight hours. The traffic flow was normal for this roadway and there were no noticeable defects.
Vehicle one, a 1998 Ford Windstar minivan, was traveling northbound on the one-way roadway when it contacted with its front, the front corner of vehicle two, a 2002 Ford Explorer compact utility vehicle, traveling westbound through the same intersection. After the initial impact, V1 traveled several feet rotating slightly counter-clockwise and jumped the northwest curb edge and contacted with its left side a traffic control box device located on the northwest curb edge. V1 then contacted with its right side a utility pole also located on the northwest curb edge. V1 continues to travel for a couple feet and contacts with its front the corner edge of a metal fence located on the same curb edge where it came to final rest on the curb facing northwest sandwiched between the utility pole and traffic device pole. Vehicle two, after the impact with V1, rotated slightly clockwise where it came to final rest facing northward. Vehicle one's damages were disabling and it was towed from the scene. Vehicle two's damages were moderate and it was not towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of V1, an unknown male with one passenger, was traveling northbound on the roadway before entering the intersection. Neither the police nor researcher were able to locate the driver and/or passenger of vehicle one for an interview. Both driver and passenger were transported by medic to the hospital where, according to police reports, both occupants immediately left refusing treatment and refusing to provide hospital personnel with personal information which made the task of locating the driver/passenger even more difficult. There was, however, a witness on scene traveling behind V2 who was interviewed.
The witness said he was traveling westbound behind V2 through the intersection on the steady green light at approximately 56 kmph (35 mph) when V1, a mini van, traveling northbound at approximately 72 kmph (45 mph) went through the red. V1 had the red light for a few seconds, he said, so the driver of V1 had enough time to see the red light and stop. The witness said he was able to stop in time enough not to become part of the crash.
The driver of V2, a 45-year old male, said he was traveling westbound at approximately 56 kmph (35 mph) and as he approached the intersection the light was steady green so he continued traveling through it. The other driver (V1) ran through the red light, there were other cars behind him and he wondered how they weren't involved in the crash. He was on his way to work he travels this roadway daily, usually without incident. He said the other driver (V1) wasn't going very fast probably not paying attention. He was not injured.
