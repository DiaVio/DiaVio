This three-vehicle crash occurred in the late afternoon hours on a weekday, in the middle of a four-way intersection. The intersection consisted of a four-lane north/south roadway, which was intersected by a three-lane east/west roadway. The west end of the roadway was physically divided by an "island." There were no traffic control devices for the north/south lanes of travel, however, stop signs controlled both the east and west directions. The bituminous roadways were dry, straight, and level. The posted speed limit for the north/south roadway was 64kmph (40mph), while the speed limit for the east/west roadway was 24kmph (15mph). Traffic flow was heavy due to rush hour traffic. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Buick Regal, was heading west in lane one, stopped at the stop sign intending to cross over the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Acura TL, was heading south in lane two intending to continue straight through the intersection. Vehicle three (V3), a 2005 Mitsubishi Endeavor, was stopped in the eastbound lane one waiting to make a right at the intersection. As V1 proceeded through the intersection the front right of the vehicle contacted the left front side of V2. After the initial impact, V1 rotated counter clockwise and V2 rotated clockwise. Both vehicles made contact again, in what is commonly referred to as a "side slap." Vehicle two continued forward and struck V3, which was stopped in the eastbound lane. Both vehicle two and vehicle three came to final rest shortly after contacting each other. Vehicle one proceeded to jump the southeast curb where it came to final rest off of the roadway on the southbound side. All three vehicles were removed from the scene due to vehicle damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, an 83 year-old woman, did not suffer any injuries and did not require any medical treatment as a result of the crash. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. A complete interview was obtained with the driver of this vehicle. She related that she was stopped at the stop sign for approximately one or two minutes. She had to wait a long time to cross the road because traffic was so heavy. When she thought it was clear, she entered the intersection and was struck by V2. She claimed that she was well rested when she began this leg of the trip and had only been driving for a minute. She had not participated in any strenuous recreational activities. There were no concerns in her work or social life that she was thinking about. The driver was in good health and the only medication she was taking was ½ an aspirin in the morning and ½ at night. She relayed that she was very familiar with the roadway, and that her vehicle was in good working condition.
The driver of V2, a 25 year-old female was not injured as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention. There was one other occupant in the vehicle, a six-month-old female, located in the middle seat of the second row, secured by a safety seat. She did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash. A complete interview was conducted with the driver of this vehicle. She relayed that she was traveling down the roadway heading home after her day at work. She noticed V1 coming out of the intersection. She said the vehicle was not going to stop and was wondering where she was going. When she realized a crash would be imminent, she tried to steer to the right as to avoid V1. This was not the case and after she hit V1, she proceeded forward and struck V3, which was stopped in the eastbound lane. The driver of V2 suspected that the driver of V1 might have hit the gas instead of the brakes. The driver was well rested and had no health problems when the crash occurred. She claimed that there were no distractions or concerns at the time of the crash. Her vehicle was in good working condition and she was familiar with the roadways.
The driver of V3, a 57 year-old woman, was not injured as a result of the crash and did not require any medical treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. An interview could not be conducted with this driver. For this reason, it is uncertain if any fatigue or health related issues contributed to this crash. After the researcher's inspection, no vehicle failure factors were apparent.
No Critical Precrash Event was coded to this vehicle because it was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, no Critical Reason could be coded to this vehicle. In addition, no associated factors were coded for this vehicle.
A witness was contacted by the researcher and a complete interview was obtained. He claimed that he was directly behind vehicle one who was stopped at the stop sign, waiting to cross over the intersection. He noticed the driver looking both ways waiting for a chance to cross. He relayed that she had waited for at least a minute, maybe longer before she proceeded. He wasn't sure why she proceeded with insufficient clearance.
