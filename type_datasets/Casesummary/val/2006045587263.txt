This crash occurred in the early evening of a weekday in the westbound lanes of a divided urban roadway just past an intersection. The roadway consisted of three lanes with lane three serving as a designated left turn only lane and divided by a median barrier wall that was protected on the end by an impact attenuator. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level and featured a posted speed limit of 64kmph (40 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2003 Nissan Maxima, was westbound in lane two. As V1 passed through the intersection it departed the left side of the road striking the impact attenuator with its front left corner. After impact V1 rotated counterclockwise more than ninety degrees before coming to final rest facing south. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was operated by a 41-year-old male that was not belted but was the beneficiary of deployed frontal airbags. He suffers from diabetes and hypertension for which he treats with medication. He was transported to an area hospital with minor injuries. He stated that he glanced right and a 'black streak' surprised him, causing him to steer left into the median. Police charged him with DUI, no seatbelt usage, failure to maintain lane, and no driver's license.
