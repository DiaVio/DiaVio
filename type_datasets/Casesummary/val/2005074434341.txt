This two-vehicle collision occurred where a 5-lane, bituminous roadway with a -6% slope meets a two-lane alleyway. Traffic flow on this roadway is heavily traveled throughout all hours of the day since it connects downtown and west suburban living/business areas. Traffic at the time of collision was heavier due to lunch hour congestion. No adverse weather conditions present at the time of collision. No control devices present for traffic entering main roadway from alleyway.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme 2-door coupe with one occupant, was facing north with the intention of turning right onto 5-lane roadway. V1 driver was waiting over one minute to turn and finally had an opportunity to do so upon a dump truck (witness vehicle) stopping in lane one in order to turn right into an alleyway. V1 driver entered roadway and was struck on left front corner by vehicle two's (V2's) right front corner. V2, a 1997 Chevrolet Malibu sedan with five occupants, was traveling east in lane 2. As V2 was traveling east alongside the dump truck, V1 entered eastbound traffic lanes by making a wide right turn and encroaching into V2's lane of travel. V1 attempted to avoid collision by braking and steering left (away from V2), but V1's encroachment into V2's travel lane made collision unavoidable. Contact between both vehicles occurred in lane 2. The force of impact rotated V1 clockwise where it came to final rest in lane 1 facing east. V2 came to final rest in lane 3 and lane 2 facing northeast. V1 was driven off from scene and V2 was moved into lane 1 before being moved into a business parking lot. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Associative factors contributing to this collision are as follows: V1's driver performed a performance error, poor directional control of vehicle, by turning into lane 2 and not remaining in lane 1 to make sure lane 2 was clear before proceeding to change lanes. Although not a contributing factor in itself, a sightline restriction was present for both vehicles due to the dump truck stopped in lane 1 waiting to turn right into alleyway.
