This single-vehicle crash occurred on a rural roadway with no traffic controls. West of the crash site, the roadway is undivided with two lanes of travel, one for each direction - eastbound and westbound. This roadway is uphill, curves left, and has a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). This crash occurred in mid-afternoon with light traffic flow on the approach to a hillcrest.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1988 Ford Ranger with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one traveling up the hill negotiating the curve. A non-contact vehicle was traveling westbound in the same lane as V1 coming from the opposite direction. The driver of V1 steered right and departed the roadway to avoid a head-on collision. V1 traveled across a gravel driveway as the driver was attempting to re-enter the roadway on the right by steering left. The driver then overcorrected by steering right and V1 began to rotate clockwise as it continued off the right side of the roadway. V1 continued to rotate sharply clockwise before it started to roll over approximately 17 meters (56 feet). V1 rolled eight quarter turns while still rotating clockwise, impacted a temporary plastic orange construction fence and came to rest on its wheels facing west. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1, a fifty-eight-year-old male, was driving from work to his wife's job. He stated that everything would have been all right if it had not been for the gravel driveway; that was where he began to lose control. He was well rested, drives this route several times a month, and is very comfortable with his vehicle. He is in good health and takes no medications, but is near-sighted and was wearing prescription sunglasses at the time of the crash. V1 had several hundred pounds of cargo in the form of tools within mounted tool boxes which raised the center of gravity of the vehicle and aided in the rollover propensity.
