A two-vehicle daytime intersection type collision occurred in the early afternoon during a period of heavy traffic. The collision occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way, five--lane divided (two way left turn lane) roadway at the intersection of a private drive. The pre-crash roadway for vehicle two is level and a slight curve to the left with a radius of curvature of 288 meters (945 feet). There is an intersection just west of collision location that is controlled by traffic lights. Westbound traffic had backed up past the private drive. The bituminous road surface was dry. Access to the roadway is not controlled. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 56 Kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Civic, was stopped facing southbound in a private driveway, attempting to turn westbound into lane one. Vehicle two (V2) a 1999 Ford F-150 pickup was traveling westbound in lane two, preparing to change into lane three, the left turn lane. As V1 entered the roadway from the private driveway, a car in lane one had stopped to let V1 through. V1 crept out a little at a time. V1 lurched forward, into and across lane two and three and was hit in the left side by the front of V2. Both vehicles were redirected in a southwesterly direction and both vehicles ran off the south road edge into another private drive. The right side of V1 struck a cement pillar before coming to rest facing south. V2 came to rest facing east in the private drive and parking lot. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 had to be extricated from the vehicle and was transported and admitted to a medical facility. The driver of V2 was not injured. The drivers were the only occupants in either vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1 was a 23 year-old male who was just leaving the bank, and headed to a gas station on the next corner for a snack. He was hungry and he had to be at work in 40 minutes. The driver is reportedly in good health, with no hearing or vision factors. He does have a previous back injury from snow boarding, and he has to lean the seat in his vehicle back quite a ways to make it comfortable. He then has to pull himself up by the steering wheel at times, to get a better view as he's looking side to side. He was well rested and is somewhat unfamiliar with the roadway. He did have concerns that have been on his mind a lot in the past 2 days, as one of his sisters almost drowned kayaking two days prior, and something else had happened to his uncle. His mind has been a little preoccupied, however he is unsure what his thought process was at the time of the crash. He was just driving. The driver also stated during the interview that he thought his foot was on the brake pedal but apparently it was on the accelerator and his car lurched forward. At impact the driver of V1 was knocked unconscious, and transported to a local trauma center for treatment. Tests were positive for opiates and negative for alcohol.
The driver of V2 was a 35 year-old male who is reportedly in good health, with no hearing restrictions; He was wearing his contact lenses to correct his near-sightedness. He was well rested with 8 hours of sleep the night before. The driver had just left the supply house, and was headed to the shop. He takes lisinopril for high blood pressure. This was a scheduled trip, and he was not in a hurry. The driver of V2 claimed that V1 shot out in front of him really fast. Considering where both vehicles came to rest, V1 had significant longitudinal speed at impact. The driver also stated during the interview that he hit the brakes prior to impact and the brake pedal broke. Images of the interior of the vehicle during post-crash inspection shows the brake pedal missing.
