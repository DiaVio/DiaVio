The crash occurred at an urban intersection of two straight, level, concrete roadways controlled by an on-colors traffic signal. V1 was traveling on a road divided by a curbed grassy median with two lanes in each direction (with an additional right turn lane in the eastbound lanes), with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). V2 was traveling on a two-way, four-lane road with a left turn only lane that became a median at the intersection, with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekend morning crash were daylight, clear and dry.
V1, a 1999 Chevrolet Silverado 4x4 pickup truck, was driven by a 55 year-old male on his way from work to a store to pick up parts for his collision shop. The driver stated that he was eastbound on the road in lane two traveling 45 mph. Four or five vehicles up ahead went through the green traffic signal at the intersection. The driver of V1 stated that when he reached the light he could only see black because of the sun shining behind it, so he proceeded through the intersection. At the last second, the driver saw V2 to his right. The driver stated that he braked but a witness stated he observed no avoidance maneuvers for V1 prior to the impact, and that he appeared to be going full speed. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V1 went into lane three following the impact and the driver pulled over to the right curb lane facing east past the intersection and came to a stop. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver denied injuries at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, a 1997 Chevrolet Venture minivan, was driven by an 81 year-old male running errands. The driver stated that he was northbound in lane three and was the first vehicle stopped at the intersection at the red traffic signal for 5-10 seconds. When the signal turned green, V2 accelerated, intending to go straight. The driver stated that he never saw V1 prior to crash and took no avoidance actions. V2 rotated clockwise following the impact and came to final rest facing east in the intersection. V2 was towed due to damage. The fully restrained driver refused treatment for his injuries.
