A two-vehicle daytime collision occurred during daylight mid-afternoon hours on a weekend. The collision occurred at the intersection of a four-lane two-way arterial street with no traffic controls and a two-way side street with a stop sign posted as traffic controls. Both streets are straight and level at the intersection and both are paved with bituminous asphalt. In the pre-crash direction for the arterial street, the road has an uphill grade that ends 50-meters (164-feet) prior to the intersection. The arterial street also curves to the right with a radius of 173-meters (567.6-feet) on the crest of the uphill. The speed limit for the both roads is 48 kmph (35 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Honda Accord sedan with only a driver, was stopped at a stop sign facing south waiting to turn left onto the arterial road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Dodge Charger sedan, was heading west in lane two with only a driver. V1 turned left at the intersection in the path of V2. V2 steered to the left and the front of V1 struck the right side of V2. V2 then deflected further to the left, went up the south curb of the arterial road and struck a street sign. V2 then continued on, striking a pedestrian standing at the bus stop, then a tree with the left side of the car. V2 came to rest after striking a second tree with the front bumper. The driver of V2 and the pedestrian were transported to the hospital for injuries. V2 was towed due to disabling damage. V1 was impounded for a police investigation, but did not require towing. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 43-year-old female, did not speak English. Her family members were unable to translate well enough for the researcher to conduct an interview.
The driver of V2, a 35-year-old male, could not be reached. Medical records indicate this driver stated he was not taking any medications and had no previous illness or medical conditions. The driver did test positive for Opiates and Cannabinoids at the hospital about one hour after the crash. The medical records indicate he was a restrained driver (with airbag deployment) that impacted a tree going about 64 kmph, or 40 mph. According to witness statements in the police report, V2 was traveling at an excessive speed up the road and the driver of V1 was not able to see it in time. Assuming an even higher travel speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) for V2, the driver of V1 had 2.6 seconds between seeing V2 and the point of impact. This is sufficient time for V1 to have made an avoidance maneuver or complete the turn. It seems far more likely that V1 did not check to the left before proceeding from the stop sign. There are no sight line restrictions or limitations for either driver.
