This two-vehicle crash took place in the early afternoon on a weekend in the middle of a 4-way intersection. The weather was clear, the asphalt surface was dry, and the roadway was level. This particular roadway had a somewhat atypical layout in that lanes 1 and 4 were designated for motor vehicle travel through the intersection, while lanes 2 and 3 were designated lanes for use by both the trolleys that travel on this north/south roadway as well as for motor vehicles intending to make left turns. Lanes 1 and 2 ran northbound and lanes 3 and 4 ran southbound. A 30-meter raised concrete median separated lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4, and served as a physical barrier providing safety for individuals to both board and exit the trolley service. Overhead red/yellow/green traffic lights controlled the movement of north and southbound travel as well as an overhead sign above lanes 2 and 3 that read "Trolley" and "Left Turn." Red/yellow/green traffic control devices were also present on each corner of the intersection. Poorly visible (faded) left turn arrows were also painted on the asphalt surface of lanes 2 and 3. There was also one lane for residential parking on each side of this street. The posted speed limit for this roadway was 48 kmph (30 mph).
V2, a 2006 Dodge Durango, was traveling northbound in lane 2, the left turn lane. V1, a 2006 Chrysler Pacifica, had just exited the northbound shoulder where it had been parked and entered lane 1, also traveling northbound. The driver of V1, a 34-year old female, explained that she had been visiting friends and had been parked in the right shoulder lane. Her intention was to approach the intersection and make a left turn from the right lane because she was unable to access the left turn lane due to the presence of the raised concrete barrier. The driver of V1 entered the intersection and proceeded to make the left turn across lane 2 when the front of V2 struck V1's left door. The PAR estimated the travel speeds of both vehicles as being approximately 30 mph (48 kmph). The PAR for this case also stated that the driver of V2 was intending to make a left turn as well, although even without an interview from this driver, the evidence strongly suggests that V2 was in fact proceeding straight through the intersection instead of making the required left hand turn. The driver of V1 said that she was certain that V2 was going straight, but even stronger evidence for this conclusion can be found in both the extent of damage to V1's left side and the damage patterns and the positions of both vehicles at their final resting positions. Observation on scene revealed that it is a common occurrence for drivers in lane 2 to go straight through the intersection. This may be due to the faded nature of the painted arrows; however, extended observation leads one to conclude that most drivers simply choose to ignore the lane markings. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The driver of V2, a 25-year old male, could not be located for an interview. He told police that he was intending to make a left turn at the intersection. Both drivers were transported from the scene directly to a hospital with (unknown) minor injuries. Both vehicles were towed.
