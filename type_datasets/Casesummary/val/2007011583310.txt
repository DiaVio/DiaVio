V1, 2007 Buick Lucerne solely occupied by a 51 year-old female driver, was eastbound in congested traffic in lane 2 of the roadway described above. V2, a 1998 Chevrolet Venture minivan solely occupied by a 29 year-old female driver was eastbound in lane 2 of the same roadway described above in front of v1. Traffic in front of v2 came to a stop. V2 came to a stop. V1, front, contacted v2, rear. V1 came to rest in lane 2 just east of the point of impact facing east. The driver of v2 steered right so as to avoid contacting the vehicle in front of her and brought v2 to final rest on the right shoulder facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of v1 stated that she was in lane 2, doing about 30 mph, going to work in congested traffic that had been slowing and then speeding up when v2 came to a stop. She was about 1.5 to car lengths behind v2 and was not able to avoid rear-ending it. She did not know that traffic was stopping.
The driver of v2 stated that she was eastbound in lane 2 about 2 car lengths behind a vehicle in front of her and she saw v1 behind her but thought it was not “tailgating” her. She saw traffic slowing ahead and had to come to a stop and as soon as she did, felt v1 contact the rear of her car. She then steered right to avoid the car in front of her and came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder.
