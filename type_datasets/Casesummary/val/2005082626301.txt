This two vehicle daytime collision occurred just past noon. The collision occurred at the intersection of a north-south roadway and a side street. The intersection also includes the driveway to a fast-food restaurant. The pre-crash roadway for northbound vehicles is level asphalt paved road with a right hand curvature, consisting of five lanes of two-way traffic with the center lane a two-way turn lane. There is a three-color traffic signal for north and south bound traffic, which is set there for a pedestrian crosswalk. The driveway and side street intersect the road just north of the crosswalk. The speed limit for the road is 48 kmph (30 mph).
Vehicle one (V1), a 1987 Dodge B1 van, driven by a male (age unknown) was traveling north on the roadway in lane 2. Vehicle two (V2), a 19989 Nissan Sentra hatchback, driven by a 21 year-old female was entering the road heading west from the driveway, to turn left onto the main road. V1 skidded into the left rear of V2, sending V2 into a counter-clockwise spin. V1 then spun clockwise in a larger circle around V2, ending facing south in the two-way turn lane. V1 then attempted to leave the scene by driving on the intersecting street, but the vehicle came to a stop within half a block. Both vehicles were towed due to damage, and the driver of V2 was transported to the hospital for treatment of her injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
