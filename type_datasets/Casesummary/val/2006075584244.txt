This two-vehicle crash occurred shortly after dawn during daylight hours on a straight, dry, bituminous, driveway related, two-lane local roadway. This roadway has apartment parking lots on each side of the road and dumpster sheds close to the roadway. The posted speed limit on the roadway is 40 kmph (25 mph) and 16 kmph (10 mph) in the parking lots. It was very early in the morning, the sun was just coming up and sky was clear.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Acura Legend, sedan driven by a 22 year-old male with two passengers was parked facing east in the parking lot and was backing up to enter the roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Mazda Protege sedan driven by a 47 year-old female, was initially parked facing west and had backed up onto the roadway. It then drove straight down the roadway heading north. V1 backed in a westward direction into the roadway the same time as V2 approached and V1 was impacted on the right side with V2's front. V1 came to rest at the impact in the middle of the roadway on its wheels facing southeast. V2 rotated slightly counter clockwise and came to rest in lane one on its wheels facing slightly northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 stated that there is a wooden shed housing a dumpster close to the road, and he did not see V2 until he passed the dumpster shed and was in the roadway. He stated he started to accelerate to avoid the collision, but the evidence did not prove this. V1 was towed from the scene.
