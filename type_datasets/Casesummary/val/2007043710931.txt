V1 is a 1993 Chevrolet Lumina, four-door, with two-occupants traveling northbound in lane four (left turn lane). V2 is a 1998 Ford Taurus, four-door with one occupant traveling southbound in lane one. A Non-Contact Vehicle (NCV) was traveling southbound in lane four, directly in front of V1. The NCV and V1 both had a steady, unprotected green light to turn left. The NCV proceeded to make a left turn onto the westbound on-ramp and was successful. V1 followed behind the NCV and made its left turn. V2 was heading south toward V1. V2 locked up its brakes and steered right in an attempt to avoid striking V1, leaving 17.8 meters (58 feet) of skid marks. The front of V2 contacted the right, front of V1 in the intersection. After impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and traveled off the roadway onto the grass roadside, coming to final rest facing west 17.8 meters (58 feet) from impact area. After impact, V2 deflected toward the right, departing the roadway and coming to final rest facing west, 16.3 meters (53 feet) from impact area. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 62 year-old female who was transported from the scene with multiple traumatic injuries. She is not employed and is receiving monthly disability checks. She reports poor sleep due to chronic back and left knee pain. She wakes up frequently throughout the night and needs at least a one-hour nap during the daytime hours. On the day of the crash, she had left her residence to drop her younger sister off at a female shelter for the homeless. She reported feeling rested when she began the trip. She says she intended to turn left and enter the expressway. She entered the left turn lane with a solid green light and slowed to 24 kph (15 mph). There was a vehicle in front of her that proceeded to turn left. She didn't see any cars coming from the opposing direction, so she proceeded to turn left just behind the lead vehicle. Just prior to entering the on-ramp, she glimpsed right and noticed V2 coming toward her car at a high rate of speed. She also noticed the driver of V2 talking on a cell phone. She jerked the wheel to the left and braked, hoping that the driver of V2 would steer right and a collision would be avoided, but that wasn't the case. V2 struck the right, front plane of her vehicle. Her vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage.
The driver of V2 is a 38 year-old male who suffered minor injuries that did not require transport. He had just finished a 13-hour work shift and was on his way home. He was driving straight at 80 kmph (50 mph) in lane one. His traffic light was green and functioning properly. He says an opposing vehicle made a left turn in front of him with plenty of gap distance and did not require him to slow down. He says V1 then unexpectedly made a left turn in front of him, possibly trying to beat him through the intersection. He locked up his brakes, braced the steering wheel and steered right in an attempt to avoid a collision, but there was nothing he could do. After impact his vehicles entered the grass area to the right of the crash and came to final rest. His vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage.
