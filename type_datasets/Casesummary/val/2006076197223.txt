This is a three vehicle rear-end type crash that occurred in the left-turn-only lane (lane four) of a six-lane asphalt roadway. The westbound lanes curve left with a radius of 625 meters (2,050 feet) and a super elevation of 4%. There is a down hill grade of 5% pre-crash. The approaching intersection is controlled by a traffic control light with a left-turn only arrow. The speed limit for the area is 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred during the late morning in a generally heavy congested section of the route.
Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Dodge Caravan mini-van with two occupants, was stopped at the red light waiting for the green arrow to complete a left turn. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Chevrolet Venture mini-van with one occupant, was stopped behind V3. Vehicle one (V1), a 1966 Chevrolet C-10 pickup with one occupant, was traveling in westbound lane two slowing to turn into the left-turn only lane when the driver felt the brakes were not slowing the truck down. The front plane of V1 contacted the rear plane of V2 that caused V2 to be pushed into the rear plane of V3. All three vehicles came to rest at the impact location. V1 was towed from the scene; V2 and V3 were driven. None of the occupants were transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 16-year-old female high-school student who did not possess a driver's license, was driving from school back to her residence to drop off the truck because she felt uncomfortable driving it. A friend was going to pick her up. She stated the brakes had to be pumped several times in order to stop the truck and as she pumped the brake pedal to stop behind V2, she realized that the brakes were not working at all. She has completed a high school driver's education course but has not obtained her drivers license yet. She is familiar with the roadway and drives it daily and has driven the truck daily for the past 6 months.
The driver of V3, a 53-year-old female and her 84-year-old female passenger were stopped in front of V2 at the red light. No interview was obtained from this driver. V3 was not involved in first harmful event and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
