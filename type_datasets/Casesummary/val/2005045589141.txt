Case #2005-45-155
The crash occurred at the intersection of an east/west four-lane median divided highway with shoulders and a two-lane side street that intersected from the north. The highway had concrete islands at the intersection in the median that created a merge/turn lane for traffic turning left to and from the side street to the highway. The highway curved to the left (south) as it traveled westward with a radius of curvature of 274m and a 4% downgrade. The two-lane side street had right and left turn lanes and was controlled by a stop sign. Traffic counts from 2003 indicate the highway carried 46,779 vehicles per day in the crash area while the side street accommodated 5,960 vehicles daily. The posted speed limit was 80kph (50mph). There were no sight distance or obstructions present at the intersection. Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday afternoon. Interestingly, the intersection was redesigned in 2004 due to the high number of crashes. The changes have not appeared to decrease the volume of incidents. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle #1 was a 1997 Toyota Camry traveling southbound on the side street. Vehicle #2, a 1990 Honda Accord, was westbound on the highway in the left lane. Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left from the side street to the highway and was struck in the front left corner by the front of Vehicle #2. After impact both vehicles came to rest facing south in the intersection just west of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.
