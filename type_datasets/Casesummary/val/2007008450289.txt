Traffic flow was light and moving freely.
V1, a 1987 Mack tri-axle dump truck with one occupant, was traveling north in lane two. V2, a 1996 Ford Contour sedan with one occupant, was traveling west in lane one. V1 was coming down the hill approaching the intersection intending to stop for the traffic light. The operator of V1 turned on the exhaust brake on high and applied the foot brakes. The driver realized that the foot brakes were degrading and he would not be able to stop in time. At this point the driver of V2 had entered the intersection unaware of the problems with V1. The driver of V1 applied the foot brakes so hard he cracked vertebrae in his back and made a conscious effort to overturn the truck in order to get it to stop. The driver of V1 made a hard right turn and then a hard left in doing so the aggregate in the cargo box began to spill and the front of V1 contacted the left side of V2 causing V2 to rotate, roll and land on its left side. V1 rolled on to its right side spilling its cargo on to the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Mack tri axle dump truck, was driven by a 46 year old male who reported fractured vertebrae, shoulder pain, fractured orbital socket and a lost tooth. He advised that he was early for his delivery and was in no hurry. The driver was new to the job and had only been working as a driver for a month and the training was on the job. He advised he planned on overturning the truck in order to get it stopped when he realized his brakes were malfunctioning. Police investigation revealed that 5 of the 8 brakes were not adjusted properly.
V2, the Ford Contour, was driven by an 81 year old female, who reported no injuries but was transported as a precaution. She stated she could not remember much but she was on her way to meet a friend for lunch. When she entered the intersection she saw the front end of the Mack truck just outside her window. She thinks she blacked out because the next thing she could remember was that her car was on its side and the fire department was cutting her out.
