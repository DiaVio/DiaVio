This crash occurred on a two-lane undivided roadway in an area near a Y-intersection. There was one southbound lane and one northbound lane. The roadway had a downhill grade of 9 percent southbound, was bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). It was early evening on a weekday and conditions were clear.
V1 was a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door driven by a 56-year-old male. V2 was a 2003 Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicle driven by a 21 year-old female. V1 was traveling northbound and had just crossed over an intersection when the right side of the vehicle departed the roadway, traveling up a small embankment. The vehicle came back onto the roadway a short distance further and then crossed into the southbound travel lane where the front left corner of V1 sideswiped the left side of V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is 40 kmph for V1 and 40 kmph for V2.
V2 had been traveling southbound and the driver attempted to steer right to avoid the collision but there was not enough time. After V1 struck V2, V2 was spun counter-clockwise. During the rotation, V2's right rear wheel contacted the curb, breaking the wheel housing.
