This one-vehicle crash occurred during the early evening hours in the three northbound express lanes of an expressway that are divided from six southbound lanes by a concrete jersey barrier. The northbound lanes are divided into express and local lanes. The three northbound express lanes transition into two lanes and the right lane becomes an off ramp used to merge onto the four local northbound lanes. The four local lanes of the expressway were not a factor in this crash either. This crash only involves the three express lanes. This roadway was dry, is straight, level, and of concrete construction and had a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). At the time of the crash it was dark, but the roadway was illuminated by street-lights and the weather was clear and the traffic was light.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 2002 four-door Nissan Altima driven by a 54 year-old male was northbound in lane one of the express lanes. The driver was fatigued due to the strenuous activity of moving his office the previous day. He was on his way home from a sporting event when the collision occurred. The driver of V 1 was in the number one exit lane with the intent to exit the expressway, when a non-contact vehicle traveling in the number two lane encroached into the number one lane an cut in front of V 1. The V 1 driver braked and steered hard left, departed the travel lanes and road to the left, and contacted the concrete jersey median barrier with the front plane. V 1 then rotated counterclockwise and contacted the barrier with it's back right corner. V1 traveled across the travel lanes to the right and came to final rest on the right shoulder of the express lanes past the off ramp. The non-contact vehicle proceeded to take the exit and drove from the scene. V 1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
