The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a six-lane roadway divided by concrete curbed grass medians. There were three southbound and three northbound lanes. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 1997 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup with one occupant, was traveling in lane three. V2, a 2001 Lexus RX300 with one occupant, was traveling in lane three ahead of V1. V3, a 1988 Lincoln Town Car with one occupant, was traveling in lane two, ahead of V2. The driver of V3 slowed in her lane and activated her left turn signal. The driver of V2 slowed down to let V3 in front of him. The driver of V3 changed lanes in front of V2 and then slowed even more. V2 gradually slowed down behind V3. Despite an avoidance maneuver of steering right and locking the brakes, the driver of V1 could not stop in time. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. The back of V2 was pushed forward into V3. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
V1, the Dodge Ram, was driven by a 41-year old male who reported no injuries. He stated that he was traveling at about 72 kmph (45 mph) and that he was heading home from work. He said that the driver of V3 suddenly stopped, as if she was intending to make a left turn from a through lane. He pointed out that the left turn lane where the driver of V3 stopped was for traffic coming northbound, and that the left turn lane for southbound traffic was further down. He hit the brakes as hard as he could, but was unable to stop in time.
V2, the Lexus RX300, was driven by a 45-year old male who was transported to a hospital with possible injuries. He stated that he was on his way to the store from his house. He was traveling about 72 kmph (45 mph) in the left through lane. The driver said that he slowed down to allow V3, which was in the middle lane, to change lanes in front of him. He stated that as soon as she changed lanes, she immediately slowed down as if she was unsure whether she was in the right place to make the turn. He did not believe that there was anyone in front of her. He said that he gradually slowed down behind her, and then was hit from the back by V1, pushing him into V3.
V3, the Lincoln Town Car, was driven by a 67-year old female who reported possible injuries, but refused treatment. She stated that a vehicle ahead of her changed lanes from the middle lane into her lane, and then slowed down to make what appeared to be a left turn. Since there was no left turn lane available, the phantom vehicle was partially sticking out into lane three. The driver realized that she was going to have to adjust her speed in case the vehicle in front of her was unable to make an immediate left turn. She indicated that she gradually slowed down, and looked in her rear-view mirror to see the gentleman behind her slowing as well. The driver said that the phantom vehicle started to make its turn, and she had just taken her foot off the brake when she was hit from behind. Because her foot was not on the brake, she was pushed past the median, halfway up the next block.
V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, no Critical Pre-crash Event or Critical Reason was coded to the driver of the Lincoln Town Car. The driver of V3 was taking a prescription medication for a thyroid condition. One associated factor for this driver was recognition related. The driver of V3 was on a cell phone at the time of the accident. This was thought to have served as a distraction and may have contributed toward confusion as to where the left turn lane was located. Although the driver of V3 claimed that she was slowing in response to another vehicle in front of her, this was disregarded, as the driver of V2 (who had slowed to let V3 in front of him) reported that there was no vehicle slowing in front of V3. Another associated factor coded to the driver of V3 was a decision error - because she decided to slow down in the through lane for no reason.
