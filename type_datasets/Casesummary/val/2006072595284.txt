This three-vehicle crash occurred in the mid-afternoon on a northbound urban expressway. A positive barrier wall divided the expressway. The southbound lanes do not play into this incident. The northbound roadway consisted of three traffic lanes, with a posted speed of 89 kmph (55 mph). The roadway surface was bituminous asphalt, straight, and level. At this time there was rush hour congestion with stop and go traffic patterns, which was a factor for all three vehicles involved in this collision.
Vehicle one (V1), a white 2005 Mercury Mountaineer carrying one occupant was traveling in the fourth lane behind vehicle two (V2), a black 2004 Ford Explorer carrying one occupant, and vehicle three (V3), a red 2002 Ford Explorer carrying one occupant as well. V3 was traveling in the lead position; it slowed to a stop because of congested traffic and V2 slowed to a stop as well. The driver of V1 did not recognize the stopped traffic ahead and impacted the rear of V2 with the front of the vehicle. This impact then caused the front of V2 to impact the rear of V3, which in turn caused the front of V3 to graze or slightly impact the barrier wall on the front left corner. V1 and V2 were both towed with significant front-end damage. V3 was not towed. The occupants in V1 and V2 had no indications of injury while the driver of V3 suffered a possible injury but was not transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
