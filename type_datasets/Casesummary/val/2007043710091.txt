This multi-event two-vehicle crash occurred at a rural four-legged intersection. The main roadway is two-lane, two-way, undivided with no traffic control devices. To the west is an entranceway to a church controlled by a stop sign. To the east is an entranceway to a residential neighborhood controlled by a stop sign. Westbound approach curves right with a slight uphill grade. Northbound approach is straight with a downhill grade. The speed limit for the main roadway is 72 kph (45 mph) while the secondary roadway is 40 kph (25 mph). Setting was early evening hours on a weekend. Conditions were daylight, sunny and dry with no adverse atmospheric conditions. Traffic flow was light.
V1 is a 2001 Ford Focus, two-door hatchback with three occupants stopped at the westbound stopl sign waiting to turn left and travel south. V2 is a 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe, two-door utility with two occupants, towing a small trailer, traveling northbound in lane one. A non contact car was stopped at the eastbound stop sign waiting to turn left and travel north. As V2 entered the intersection, V1 made its left turn. The front of V1 contacted the right, rear of V2 (event 1). V2 steered left crossing the center-line entering the southbound travel lane in an attempt to avoid a collision. The right side of V2's trailer then sideswiped the front-end of V1 (Event 2). After Event 2, the trailer rotated clockwise and started to jackknife. The trailer departed the road to the left causing V2 to rotate clockwise in the roadway. V2 left 24.4 meters (80 feet) of yaw marks before overturning, left side leading in the travel lanes. V2 rolled over 34 meters (111 feet) totaling five-quarter turns before contacting a 30 cm diameter tree with its right side (Event 4). V2 came to final rest on its left side facing south 53.8 meters (176 feet) from impact. V1 traveled 4.7 meters (15 feet) after impact and came to final rest facing northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 34 year-old female who was not injured in this crash. She tells me that herself, her husband and son were leisurely driving around looking at new houses to buy. She is new to this area of town and has never driven on this roadway before. She says as she approached the four-way intersection, she intended on turning left. She stopped at the stop sign, looked left, then right, saw nobody coming in either direction, so put her vehicle in gear and proceeded to turn left. She says V2 came out of no-where from the left and she never saw him until she was contacting his right side. The sun was setting and in the eyes of this driver, but she adamantly denied that being a factor in the crash when questioned about it by me. Her vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage.
The driver of V2 is a 22 year-old male who suffered minor injuries in this crash. On this leisurely afternoon, he drove over to a friend's house five minutes away to pick up some furniture. After loading approximately 500 lbs of furniture into his homemade trailer, the driver and his friend drove home to unload the furniture. As he came around a left curve at 72 kph (45 mph) he noticed V1 on the right side of the intersection and another vehicle stopped on the left side of the intersection, up ahead. He didn't think much of it, so continued on his straight path. As he entered the intersection, he saw V1 start to pull out into his lane. He knew braking wasn't an option, so he steered left to avoid a collision, but V1 struck his right, rear quarter panel. His trailer then contacted the front of V1, causing it to go airborne and jackknife, spilling his furniture on the roadside. Once his vehicle started to yaw clockwise, the tires caught, causing his vehicle to roll over several times and come to rest against a tree. His unrestrained friend and dog were both ejected from the vehicle during the rollover sequence. His vehicle suffered disabling damage resulting in it being towed.
