This single-vehicle crash occurred during morning daylight hours on a weekend. The crash occurred on a curved left stretch of a six-lane, dry, positively divided, concrete expressway. The sixth lane is a designated high-occupancy-vehicle lane, and the speed limit in the area of the crash was 105 kmph (65 mph). At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 2000 Toyota Echo two-door coupe, was traveling southbound in the fifth lane and negotiating a leftward curvature. A non-contact vehicle moved from the fourth lane towards the fifth lane. V 1 veered left impacted the concrete traffic barrier with its front plane. V 1 came to rest in the sixth lane. The 41-year-old female driver of V 1 told the police that she veered away from the non-contact vehicle, but she told the researcher that she was impacted on the right front panel by the other vehicle. Her other responses maintain that version, but it is not supported by physical evidence. The driver also reported that her thoughts were focused on her destination, that being the first day of classes. She also said that she maintains high stress levels related to her work. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1.
