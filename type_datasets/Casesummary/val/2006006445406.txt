This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekend on the right (east) roadside of a divided residential roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of three lanes in each direction divided by a curbed grass median. The roadway was bituminous, dry, and level and featured a posted speed limit of 64kmph (40 mph). The roadway curved to the left as one continued northbound. The roadway was free of noticeable defects and the painted lane lines were well marked. The traffic flow was minimal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1998 Ford Explorer, was northbound in lane two negotiating the left curve. As V1 continued through the curve it began to lose control. The driver braked and steered to the left and than to the right. The driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle and V1 departed the roadway to the right. As V1 departed the roadway its right front corner struck the curb and damaged its undercarriage. V1 continued along the curb and struck a light pole with its front. This second impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise back across the three lanes of traffic and strike the curbed median. V1 came to final rest as its right front tire dug into the soft ground of the median. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 19-year-old female, was traveling with her sister and 5-month old child to a friend's house. The driver and child were uninjured while her sister sitting in the right front passenger seat was transported for non-incapacitating injuries. Numerous attempts to contact the driver of V1 proved unsuccessful, however a surrogate interview with the passenger was obtained. The passenger informed this researcher that she and the driver were talking and singing along with the radio and “probably” going to fast for the curve. The passenger refuted the claim made on the PAR that the brakes failed, and stated that they worked fine. She did state that the driver had very little experience with the SUV and was generally uncomfortable driving it.
