Vehicle one was a 1998 Chrysler Concorde 4-door sedan traveling east in lane two. Vehicle two was a 1999 Lexus RX300 sport utility traveling south in lane two.

Vehicle four was a 1989 Nissan Stanza 4-door sedan parked just ahead of V3. Vehicle five was a 1995 Ford Explorer sport utility parked just ahead of V4. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time. The left plane of V1 was impacted by the front of V2 (Event 1). V1 rotated counterclockwise 300 degrees before coming to rest east of the intersection in lanes one and two. V2 continued off the southeast corner of the intersection and rear-ended V3 (Event 2), which was parked. V3's front was pushed forward into V4's rear (Event 3). V4's front was pushed forward into V5's rear (Event 4). Vehicles 2, 3, 4, and 5 all came to rest in the right parking lane on the outgoing east leg of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
The Chrysler Concorde (V1) was driven by a 34-year old male who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries, along with his passenger. He was unable to be located by phone or at his address for an interview. The investigating officer estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 56 kmph (35 mph) and 64 kmph (40 mph), respectively. His Chrysler sedan was towed due to damage. A witness on the police report told police that V1 ran a red light.
The Lexus RX300 (V2) was driven by a 34-year old female who suffered possible injuries, but was not transported. She stated that she was heading to work when V1 crossed the intersection in front of her, forcing her vehicle into the parked car. She didn't have a chance to react in avoidance. She estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 48 kmph (30 mph). Her Lexus sport utility was towed due to damage.
No Critical Pre-crash Event or Reason was coded to vehicles three, four, or five because they were not in-transport at the time of the crash.
