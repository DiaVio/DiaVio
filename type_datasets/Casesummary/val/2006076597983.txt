Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chevrolet Venture mini van, was westbound and had just exited a right hand curve when the vehicle began to fishtail on the wet roadway. The vehicle initiated a clockwise yaw as it ran off the right side of the roadway then crossed an extended dirt shoulder where it impacted a small dirt embankment. This vehicle then traveled up the embankment and came to rest facing west. The 80 year-old male driver stated to police that he had reached for something inside the vehicle. The driver and 83 year-old passenger were transported to a local hospital where they were treated and released. The vehicle was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver and wife were returning to their residence from their daughter's funeral that was held out of state. The driver stated that they had been on the road for 3 days and were about 193 kilometers (120 miles) from their destination. He had driven approximately 2,816 kilometers (1750 miles) in the three days and stated he was somewhat fatigued. He is familiar with the vehicle and rarely drives the route. The driver stated that he is in fair health having survived lung cancer and prostrate cancer for which he takes a daily regiment of drugs. He stated that they had been on the road this day for about 10 hours. He thought the vehicle had lost steering control just before the crash: like something had broken at the right front wheel area. However he did not state this to the investigating officer but instead stated he was reaching for something to his right and took his eyes off the road. Upon inspection of the vehicle the damaged right front wheel could be seen and the skid marks at the scene showed all tires to be in their respective positions up to the first impact. A witness who was traveling in the opposite direction stated the vehicle seemed to fishtail before it left the roadway.
