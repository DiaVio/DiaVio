A three vehicle rear-end crash occurred heading east on a two-way city street with two lanes of travel. The road is paved with bituminous asphalt, and has an uphill grade of +7% heading east. The posted speed limit for the road is 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday evening about 2 hours before sunset.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Volvo V40 station wagon, was traveling east on the roadway going straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 GMC Sierra pickup, was stopped facing east behind vehicle three. Vehicle three (V3), a 1995 Honda Accord sedan, was stopped in front of V2 with only 1.2-meters (four feet) of space between V2 and V3. V3 had come to a stop because vehicles ahead of V3 were stopped for an unknown reason. There were no traffic controls for this direction of travel, but there was an intersecting side street a short distance forward from where the crash occurred that may have been related to why the forward traffic stopped. V1 did not stop in time and its front impacted with the rear of V2, pushing V2 into V3. The driver of V3 was transported to the hospital due to injury, and V3 was towed. V1 was towed due to disabling damage, but V2 was driven from the crash scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V3 was a 26-year-old female who was traveling with three additional passengers. She was on an errand giving her friend and her friend's children a ride to their house. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event, but its pre-event movement was coded: stopped in traffic lane.
