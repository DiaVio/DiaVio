This two-vehicle late afternoon crash occurred in an urban intersection of two five-lane roadways which are controlled by operating overhead tri-color traffic signals with pedestrian controls. The roadway is straight, level, and bituminous where the crash occurred, and has a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The westbound road has a downhill grade until just before the threshold of the intersection. Several lanes in the north part of the intersection were closed for construction. Eastbound traffic in the west entry to the intersection was limited to two lanes and a "No Left Turn" sign was placed in the number two lane. Westbound traffic in the east entry to the intersection was limited to three lanes. There were also a large number of orange and white diagonal signs topped by flashing amber lights which delineated the closed lanes, etc. At the time of the crash, the roads were dry, the sky was clear and there were no road defects or sight restrictions.
Vehicle one (V1), a red 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix 2 door with one occupant, was eastbound in the number two lane which was clearly marked with a "No Left Turn" sign at the approach to the intersection. The driver, a 25 year old male, was stopped at a green light, waiting for traffic to clear, intending to turn left. Vehicle two (V2), a white 1998 Honda Accord 4 door was westbound at a speed of about 56 kmph (35 mph) approaching the intersection intending to go straight. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
The V2 driver, a 29 year old female, was westbound and entered the intersection going straight. The V1 driver entered the intersection to complete the left turn when the light turned red and the front of V1 struck the front of V2. V1 and V2 came to final rest within the intersection near the point of impact. The V1 driver did not attempt an avoidance maneuver, but did state that a westbound vehicle was turning left and may have partially obscured his vision of V2. He added that he had not noticed the "No Left Turn" sign. V1 was towed due to damage and V2 was not towed due to damage. The V2 driver stated that he did not see V 1 until the crash occurred and did not attempt an avoidance maneuver. She stated that she was within the intersection when the light turned red and did not have enough time to brake before the crash. She stated that she had seen V1 stopped in the intersection and assumed that she had enough time to clear the intersection and thought that V1 would wait for her. A witness who was traveling behind V2 westbound stated that he saw V1 stopped at the intersection waiting to make a left turn and added that as the light turned red, V1 began to complete the left turn and V2 ran the red light and collided with V1.
Associative factors: the westbound vehicle that was turning left may have restricted the V1 driver's line of sight to V2; the traffic barriers may have been a distracting factor for both drivers.
