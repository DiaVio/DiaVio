This crash occurred on a weekday afternoon on an undivided, two-lane, rural roadway. The east/west roadway consisted of one lane in each direction and featured a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55 MPH). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1995 Chevrolet Tahoe, was eastbound on the roadway. V1 crossed over the centerline, into the westbound lane, off the left side of the roadway and sideswiped a 30cm diameter tree with its front. V1 continued down the embankment, sideswiped a 38cm diameter tree with its front, then struck and uprooted an 18 cm diameter tree with its front. V1 continued over a large boulder and sideswiped another large tree. V1 continued down the embankment, struck two small saplings with its front and came to rest facing in an easterly direction. V1 was towed due damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
V1 was driven by a belted 63-year-old male who was transported, treated and released with minor injuries. The belted occupants, a 65-year-old female right front passenger, 22-year-old male second seat left passenger and 30-year-old female second seat right passenger were all transported, treated and released for minor injuries. The driver (through an interpreter, he spoke very little English) advised that he had left his upstate cabin and was traveling home. He had been talking to his passengers who were in the rear seat. They became quiet and he turned to see why. When he turned his attention back to the road he was off the left side of the roadway heading into the trees. He brake and steered in an attempt to avoid the crash, but was unable to. He wore bifocals for myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (far-sighted) conditions. He took medications that morning for high blood pressure and diabetic conditions.
