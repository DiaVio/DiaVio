The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of an east/west interstate in an interchange area where two lanes exited off to the north initially but also ends up an east/west interstate. There were four westbound travel lanes with paved shoulders and a concrete barrier wall separating eastbound lanes from westbound. At the interchange there is an approximately 50meter gore and a grassy area with a roadway identifier sign in the split. There is also a slight curve left with a radius measuring 563meters. Lane two of the westbound interstate splits into two lanes (unmarked) just before the gore. The roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 89kph (55mph). Conditions were dark, unlit and raining with wet roads on a weekday morning.
Vehicle #1 was an unknown tractor pulling a tanker trailer (hit and run) that was traveling in lane two of the westbound interstate lanes when it rear-ended Vehicle #2 at the beginning of the curve left (south). Vehicle #2 was a 1996 Dodge Intrepid also traveling in lane two of the interstate. Vehicle # 1 continued on westbound without stopping. After initial impact Vehicle #2 slid in a clockwise yaw west into the gore at the split and into the grass area. It struck a sign with its left before crossing the grass area and the two lanes that split off to the northwest coming to rest on the right side of that roadway partially on the shoulder facing north. Vehicle #2 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of Vehicle #1 drove away from the scene and was unable to be located.
Vehicle #2, was driven by a thirty six year old belted male that was uninjured in the crash. Due to a language barrier only a brief statement was acquired on-scene and follow up attempts were unsuccessful.
