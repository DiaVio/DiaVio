This three-vehicle crash occurred a couple hours before mid-night on a dry, dark, unlighted, asphalt four-lane roadway. The highway runs east/west at this point with two lanes running east and two lanes running west that are separated by a depressed grassy median. The crash occurred just after an on-ramp from the right to the highway; therefore, there were three lanes that had narrowed into two lanes at the point of the crash. There is a yield sign posted on the on-ramp. There is a merge sign posted on the south side of the highway just before the on-ramp for eastbound traffic. The speed limit is 89 kph (55 mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions.
Vehicle one (V1) an unknown vehicle, merged onto the highway and was traveling in lane one. Vehicle two (V2) a 2000 Plymouth Neon sedan driven by a 17 year-old female was eastbound in second lane. Vehicle three (V3) a 1996 Oldsmobile Bravada SUV driven by a 28 year-old female also merged onto the highway and began traveling east in the second lane behind V2. V2 went to change lane from lane two to lane one when it's right side contacted V1. After the first impact V2 rotated clockwise across lane two. During the rotation, it was contacted on its right side by the front of V1 in lane two. This caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise into the center median on the north side of the highway. V2 came to final rest facing northwest in the center median on the north side of the highway. V3, after impact, rotated clockwise and continued across the eastbound lanes of traffic and off the right side of the road. V3 came to final rest facing east in the depressed grassy median on the south side of the highway. V1 fled the scene of the crash in an unknown direction. V2 and V3 were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
