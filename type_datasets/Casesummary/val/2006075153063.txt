This two-vehicle rear-end crash occurred in the southbound lanes of an expressway. The north and southbound lanes are divided by a grass median. The southbound traffic lanes consisted of two through lanes that were about to merge with two entrance ramp lanes. The roadway was straight, level and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred during the early afternoon hours with moderate to heavy traffic flow. The sky was clear and the road was dry.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer with one occupant, was stopped southbound in lane two. The vehicle had stalled due to engine deficiency. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Saturn LS1 with two occupants, was also southbound, in lane two following a non-contact vehicle approaching V1. The driver of V2 was following at a gap the driver estimated at 15 meters (50 feet) at a driver-estimated speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The driver of the non-contact vehicle suddenly veered into the median when the driver of V2 detected V1. The driver of V2 braked leaving tire skid marks of 44 meters (149 feet) before the front of V2 struck the rear of V1. Both vehicles moved together before coming to rest in lane two. V1 was driven from the scene while V2 was towed. None of the occupants were transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a fifty-two-year-old male, was just driving around town from home when the crash occurred. He was rested, drives this route several times a month and is very comfortable with the vehicle. This driver has diabetes, which is controlled by Lexapro and Gluocovance taken regularly. The driver stated the engine in V1 just stopped running and there was too much traffic in the right lane so he could not make it to the right shoulder. He did not try to drive into the median or left shoulder. He stated he was stopped for over 30 seconds before V2 struck the rear of his vehicle.
The driver of V2, a fifty-seven-year-old male, was on his way to his son's house from running an errand when the crash occurred. He was well rested, drives this route monthly and is comfortable with the vehicle. He was talking to his son, the right front passenger, at the time of the crash. According to the driver, he was following a pickup truck (non-contact vehicle) at a gap distance of 15 meters (50 feet) at a driver-estimated speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The truck was a view obstruction and the driver of V2 did not detect V1 until the truck veered into the median. The driver could not steer right because of the traffic in lane one and could not steer left because of the truck.
