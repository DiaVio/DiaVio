Vehicle #1 (V 1), a 2001 Lexus IS300 sedan, driven by a 27 year-old female was traveling north in lane four of five. The driver initiated a lane change to the right, noticed that lane four was occupied by another vehicle, steered hard to the left, departed the road to the left and had a front event with the concrete jersey barrier, re-entered the roadway in a counterclockwise yaw on a northeast trajectory, crossed all lanes to the right, departed the roadway and had a second front event with the concrete barrier located off the right side of the road. V 1 came to rest partially on the right shoulder and partially in the number one lane facing generally southwest. A witness, the driver of the non-contact vehicle, stated that he thought that V 1 had been in the HOV lane before the encroachment into his lane and that after the V 1 driver steered away from his vehicle apparently struck the left barrier, but he did not actually see or hear V 1 strike the left barrier. V 1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
