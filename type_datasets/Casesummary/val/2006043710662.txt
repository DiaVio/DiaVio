This two vehicle, multi event crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a four-way urban highway interchange. There were three northbound lanes one of them was a left turn lane and two southbound lanes. To the east was a highway off-ramp with a traffic control device and to the west was a high-way on ramp. The roadway had a posted speed of 72 KMPH (45 MPH) and was straight on the south side of the intersection and it had a curve on the north side of the intersection. Roadway was bituminous asphalt and dry with no adverse atmospheric conditions. The setting was morning hours on a weekday. Traffic at the time of the crash was heavy, rush hour traffic.
Vehicle 1 is a 2005 Honda Civic sedan with one occupant, traveling northbound in lane three, the left turn lane with the intention of turning onto the west bound highway on-ramp. Vehicle 2 is a 1998 Nissan Frontier pickup truck with one occupant traveling southbound in lane one with the intention of crossing straight through the intersection. The traffic light turned yellow for V1 and V2. V1 turned left and impacted the left side of the V2. Vehicle 2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, in effect striking an electric pole with the right back side of his pickup truck, then striking a highway guardrail with the front right side. He then traveled along the level grass shoulder before returning back onto the roadway and coming to final rest approximately 50 meters (165 feet) south of initial Point of Impact in lane 3 of the southbound lanes facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
Vehicle 1, the Honda Civic, was driven by a 39 year-old that works 40 hours per week at a bank. He does not report any fatigue, emotional or health related issues, but has been required to work rotating shifts recently, involving working on Sundays. This driver was on his way to work from his residence when this crash occurred. He was in the left turn lane attempting to turn onto the west bound highway on-ramp. He reported having a yellow light and proceeded to go through the intersection. He said he looked, but did not see any vehicles coming from his right. He made no avoidance maneuvers before striking the left side of Vehicle 2. He kept iterating that the intersection has poor distance visibility and that there should be left turn arrow instead of a steady green because rush hour traffic is so heavy that you can't see what's coming from the opposite direction. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene with disabling damage.
Vehicle 2, the Nissan Frontier, was driven by a 17 year-old high school student. He does not report any fatigue, emotional, or health related issues, but reports being stressed out about final exams at school that day and was thinking of these concerns when the crash occurred. This driver was on his way to school from his residence when the crash occurred. He was in lane 1 traveling southbound through the intersection when the crash occurred. He advised he was traveling 72 KMPH (45 MPH) as he crossed through the intersection. He says the light was yellow as he went through the intersection, and that cars stopped in lane to his left (lane 2), obstructed his vision of Vehicle 1, that ran into him. The driver steered right to avoid the collision, but was unsuccessful and his vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling damage.
