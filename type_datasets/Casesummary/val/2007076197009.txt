This single-vehicle crash occurred in a rural canyon residential area on a 2-lane asphalt roadway. The southbound lane is straight and level at the pre-crash location then curves left dramatically where a bridge crosses over a dry creek bed. There are warning signs for curves in the road and for the narrow bridge. There is also a reflector roadside sign at the beginning of the small bridge on the right side. The speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred very late at night with no street lights present.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford F-250 Super Duty pickup, was southbound when it failed to negotiate the left curve and began to skid longitudinally and impacted the reflector sign located at the beginning of the bridge. V1 continued forward and traveled over the edge and down the embankment where it flipped one-quarter turn to the right and came to rest on its right side in the creek bed facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver fled the scene and was unable to be contacted for an interview.
