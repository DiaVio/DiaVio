Vehicle 3, a 2003 Toyota Camry was in front of V2, which came to abrupt stop causing for slowing traffic. This caused V2 to also decelerate quickly which caused Vehicle 1 to impact the back of Vehicle 2; Vehicle 2's front bumper then contacted Vehicle 3's back bumper. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
A 59-year-old male who claimed to be keeping up with the traffic drove vehicle 1. V1 was towed due to damage but the driver was not injured. He was cited for failure to use due care, as he was unable to stop in time. He also could not produce proof of insurance.
