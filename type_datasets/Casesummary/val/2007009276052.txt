The crash occurred on a one-way northbound roadway with 7 lanes. The lanes had a slight uphill elevation of about 3 percent with a left curve. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a roadway that led to a stadium but could also be used to access other parts of roadways. The crash occurred in the late part of the evening. Traffic was light at the time.
V1, a 2005 Ford Mustang convertible, was driven by a 27-year old female who was traveling alone and was under the influence of alcohol. V1 was traveling in lane 1 when it struck the curb and departed the roadway to the right. The driver drove on the sidewalk for about 30 meters before striking a tree with the front and came to rest against the tree. Upon arrival by police, the driver was handcuffed and refused a Breathalyzer test. The investigating officer reported that the driver "reeked" of alcohol. In an interview conducted three weeks later, the driver stated that she had left a company party and that she was on her way home when she took a different route to avoid traffic. She claimed that some animal ran out in front of her and she swerved to avoid hitting it and lost control of her vehicle, thus hitting the tree. In following up with the investigating officer, it was learned that the driver of V1 had made no mention about an animal being in the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
