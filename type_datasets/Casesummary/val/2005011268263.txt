V1, a 1999 Chrysler Concorde, was proceeding south out of a commercial (gas station) driveway turning left (east) onto a 5 lane roadway. This driveway was approximately 60 meters west of a fully controlled intersection. In order to travel east on this roadway, V1 needed to cross 2 westbound lanes and 1 center turn lane used by the eastbound traffic at the aforementioned intersection. V2, a 1989 Dodge Caravan, was westbound in lane 2 of the 5-lane east/west roadway. V2 had just proceeded through the intersection west of the driveway and V2 was traveling at a constant speed. Traffic was backed up in lane 1 of the westbound lanes so V1 was going between stopped cars in lane 1 to turn left. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
