The crash occurred on a two-way bituminous roadway in the early evening hours on a weekday. The roadway consisted of three lanes with a travel lane in each direction; a center left turn lane, and bicycle lanes between the travel lane and the curb in each direction. Conditions were dark but lighted, it was lightly snowing, and the straight roadway was snow, slush and ice covered. The posted speed limit was 56kph (35mph).
Vehicle 1, a 2000 Suburu Legacy driven by a 31 year-old male, was southbound on the road traveling up a 3% grade. The driver slowed behind a bus turning right onto a side street in front of V1. As the bus turned, the driver of V1 sped up and lost control on an icy section of the road. The driver attempted to brake and steer the vehicle left to regain control but V1 spun clockwise, crossed the bicycle lane and struck a curb on the right road edge. The driver steered left and V1 then rotated counterclockwise and crossed the lane edge on the left, the left turn lane and into the path of V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle 2, a 2002 Ford Focus driven by a 34 year-old male, was northbound on the same roadway when V1 traveled out of control from west to east on the road in front of him. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the northbound travel lane, and came to rest facing southwest in the same lane. V2 rotated to the left and was pushed partially into the bike lane, where it was struck by vehicle 3.
Vehicle 3, a 2005 Mazda 3 driven by a 29 year-old female, was northbound in the lane behind V2, and after V2 spun counterclockwise in front of V3, the front of V3 struck the left side of V2. V2 came to rest in the northbound bike lane area in the mouth of a commercial driveway facing northwest. V3 came to final rest in the bike lane facing north.
Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed due to damage. Vehicle 3 was driven from the scene. The driver and passenger airbags in V1 and V2 deployed. Medical treatment of drivers and passengers, all restrained with lap and shoulder belts, was refused at the scene.
Another factor coded for this driver was fatigue as he worked doing research at the university all night and slept 4 hours during the day and described himself as “feeling tired today”. An associated factor was coded for this driver as he is usually the passenger in the vehicle driving down that road, and only drives it himself monthly.
The driver was cited for “Speed too fast” in the crash. The driver was wearing a contact lens to correct a myopic condition and stated that he was on medication as a preventative measure and also takes Vitamin B daily. A possible associative factor was coded for his antibiotic, which is preventative for many different infections, and has potential side effects including drowsiness, confusion, dizziness and visual disturbances. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.
