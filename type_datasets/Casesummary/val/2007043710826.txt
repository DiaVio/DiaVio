This single-vehicle rollover crash occurred on a straight stretch of north/south roadway divided by a grass median with no barriers present except for positive guardrails surrounding the bridge. There were two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. Northbound approach contained a negative 7.8% downhill slope, then leveled out as it approached the bridge. The road surface is bituminous asphalt with a posted speed limit of 88 kph (55 mph). Setting was afternoon hours on a weekday. Conditions were clear, sunny and dry.
Vehicle One was a 2001 Pontiac Sunfire, two-door, compact with one occupant traveling northbound in lane one. V1 departed its lane to the left and slightly crossed the west yellow fog line. V1 then steered right and re-entered lane one with its right side. V1 then steered left, overcorrecting, and started in a counterclockwise yaw. V1 left approximately 29.0 meters (95 feet) of yaw marks on the road before departing the road to the left. V1 traveled down the grass median, then back up it with the right side leading. When V1 met the southbound lanes, it overturned 2 quarter-turns, while traveling across the southbound lanes. V1 then departed the west side of the roadway and traveled down a -29% ditch and came to final rest on its top facing west approximately 31 meters (102 feet) from rollover initiation. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.
The driver of V1 is a 55 year-old female who suffered evident injuries and was transported to the hospital for treatment. She is an otherwise healthy female with no prior medical conditions. She has a full time job nightly, and a part-time job daily. She works an average of 61 hours per week. The night prior to the crash, she left work two hours early because she was tired and needed to "lay" down. The next day she worked a few extra hours at her day job because she had that night off. She normally meets her mother once weekly for an afternoon sandwich. But when she left work this day, she was too tired and wanted to go home and take an hour nap first; which she had never done in the past. She was unsure why she had been so tired the past few days. When she left work, she called her mother on her cell phone while driving, and explained the situation. She then hung up the phone and placed it in the center console because it bothers her when people drive and talk on their cell phones. The last thing she could recall was putting the phone down and driving straight ahead in lane one. She feels like she may have blacked out or had a seizure, even though she has no prior history and the medical tests performed at the hospital were negative for any abnormal conditions. Her vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling rollover damage.
