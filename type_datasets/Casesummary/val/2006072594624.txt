This three-vehicle crash occurred during late afternoon daylight hours in the westbound lanes of an expressway that has four lanes in each direction which are divided by a concrete jersey barrier. All vehicles were westbound in the number four lane. The area of the crash is a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear, the roads were dry, and there were no sight restrictions or road defects. Traffic was typical moderate rush hour congestion.
Vehicle one (V 1), a 2003 Hyundai Tiburon two door driven by a 25 year-old male was westbound in lane four.
