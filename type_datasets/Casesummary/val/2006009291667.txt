The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane undivided roadway (two lanes each direction) with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a level, bituminous, dry roadway with a slight curve to the left. It was dawn on a weekday with clear skies. Traffic was heavy during commuting hours.
V1 was a 2007 Toyota Camry four-door sedan driven by a 47-year old female who was on her way to work. She was traveling east in lane 2 when a non-contact vehicle crossed over the double yellow lines from the opposite direction, encroaching into the path of V1. The driver of V1 steered right in an attempt to avoid a head-on collision with the non-contact vehicle. This action caused the front right of V1 to strike the left rear side of V2, a 2003 Chevrolet Silverado pickup that was traveling east in the first lane of travel. The driver of V1 did not know if she braked or not during the avoidance and impact sequences, and after striking V2, she continued forward, drove off the roadway onto a center island and struck a tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V2, the 2003 Chevrolet Silverado, was driven by a 37-year old male. V2 was traveling eastbound in lane 1 at an unknown speed. The driver of V2 did not want to talk and drove away with a flat left rear tire. Later attempts to inspect V2 or interview the driver were unsuccessful. The driver flatly refused to provide any information. No one was transported due to injuries.
The police accident report did not list the non-contact vehicle as a cause; it only stated that V1 merged into lane 1, striking V2. Due to the damage points and the heavy traffic on the roadway at the time of the crash, it was thought that the non-contact vehicle was present when the crash occurred.
