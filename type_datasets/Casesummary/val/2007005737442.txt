The crash occurred at the intersection of a north/south three-lane undivided roadway and an east/west undivided two-lane roadway that ended at the intersection in the westbound direction. The north/south roadway had a left turn-only lane in each direction with one through lane. The north/south roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35mph). The westbound roadway had a downhill grade of 5 percent and a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The intersection was controlled by traffic signals all around. The crash occurred mid-afternoon on a weekday. The weather was clear and sunny and all roadways were bituminous and dry. This was a heavily traveled intersection.
V1, a Ford F250 pick-up truck with cap, was traveling northbound with the intention of continuing straight through the intersection. V2, a 2005 Mercedes Benz CLK convertible, was stopped on the westbound roadway intended to turn right at the intersection. As per a witness who was behind V2, when the traffic signal turned green, V2 entered the intersection to complete its right turn. At that time, V1 went though the red light and the front right corner of V1 struck the front left side of V2. After impact, V1 rotated clockwise 45-50 degrees and skidded until V1 tripped and rolled over. The combination of the angle of the tire and the speed of the vehicle caused a trip-over rollover. The vehicle rolled 4-quarter turns involving an embankment before coming to final rest on all four tires, facing east, partially on the roadside. The driver, a 22 year-old male who was the sole occupant, stated that he was not wearing a seat belt, was able to exit his vehicle under his own power and was transported to the hospital for abrasions and a kidney contusion. The driver stated as he proceeded through the intersection traveling 35-40 mph, he saw the other vehicle "creeping" into the intersection. He stated he steered his vehicle to the left but was unable to avoid contact. The driver was in good health and was familiar with this roadway due to his job. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V2 was driven by a 62-year old female, who was the sole occupant. The driver reported that she was traveling westbound and was stopped for a red traffic control device. The driver had her right turn signal on and intended to make a right turn. When the TCD turned green, the driver proceeded into the intersection when a vehicle approaching from the right struck her vehicle. V2 then rotated clockwise and came to rest partially off the right side of the roadway in the northbound lane. The driver was not injured and refused medical treatment. The driver stated she did not see the other vehicle until contact was made, therefore she didn't think that she made any avoidance maneuver. The witness on-scene stated she was stopped at the red signal behind V2 and confirmed the driver of V2's version of events. The driver was in good general health and was familiar with this roadway.
