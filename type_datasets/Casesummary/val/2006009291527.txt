The crash occurred on an east/west undivided three-lane roadway. The middle lane was a turning lane for both directions. This was a level, bituminous roadway with a left curve for westbound traffic and a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was dawn on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was moderate and sun glare was not a factor.
V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche pick-up truck with one occupant, was traveling east in lane one, negotiating the left curve when he dozed off and V1 drifted to the left across the middle turn lane and then into westbound lane. V2, a 1995 Honda Accord four-door with one occupant, was traveling west in lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V2 had no time to react and the two vehicles collided, front-to-front, in the westbound lane.
V1, the Chevrolet Avalanche, was driven by a 51-year old male who was transported due to injuries. He stated that he had just come from work, 35 miles away, and was on his way home, one block away. He advised that he was traveling at about 64 kmph (40 mph) when he entered the curve and fell asleep. His vehicle drifted over the line to the left and collided with V2. There were no avoidance maneuvers.
Witness #1 stated that she was 5 to 7 car lengths behind V2, traveling at 32 to 40 kmph (20 to 25 mph). She looked ahead and saw V1 appear to be turning left onto an adjacent roadway, although she didn't see any indicator lights blinking on V1. She thought at the time that if V1 turned at that moment that he would collide with V2. Until she got to the scene, she thought that was what happened, but when she looked at the location of the crash, she saw it was located well past the adjacent street. At the location of the crash, there was no place V1 could have turned left into. She had no idea why V1 did what it did.
V2, the 1995 Honda, was driven by a 51-year old male who was transported due to injuries. He stated that he was traveling at a rate of 48 kmph (30 mph) and had left his home, about 20 miles away, half an hour previously on his way to work. He was going straight, approaching the curve when V1 suddenly crossed the middle turn lane, came into his lane, and collided with his vehicle. He stated he had no time to react, neither braking nor steering.
