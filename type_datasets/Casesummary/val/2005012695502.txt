V1, a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire, was traveling southbound on a three-lane, one way, dry, concrete highway with a positive barrier in daylight conditions. V1 was traveling in the second lane of travel. V1 reported that there was a non-contact vehicle in front of her that merged onto an off-ramp to the right. At the last second the non-contact vehicle changed her mind and steered left back into V1's lane of travel. V1 tried to avoid contacting the other vehicle and steered left. V1 contacted the median wall with its right front and rotated counterclockwise. V1 then contacted its right rear to the median wall before coming to final rest up against the wall facing north.
The driver of V1 was a 25-year-old female who had reported that she had been traveling between 82-97 Kph (51-60 MPH) prior to the crash. She had no health related problems and had taken no medication prior to the crash. She was rested and was on her way home. She was wearing her prescribed contacts that corrected a Myopic (near-sighted) condition. She was also wearing over-the-counter sunglasses at the time of the crash.
