V1 was a 2005 blue Hyundai Sonata 4 door sedan driven by a 58 year-old female with two of the driver's grandchildren with her, ages 4 and 5. V1 was traveling northbound in the second lane, going to the store to drop off a pair of glasses for repair, do some shopping and have lunch with the kids. The driver is familiar with this intersection since she drives it once a week. As the driver approached the intersection, the light turned red. Some time during a 1-block distance while approaching the intersection, the driver suffered a narcoleptic episode for a short few seconds. During this time, the driver fell asleep and did not know what happened until she was struck. The last thing the driver remembers is seeing a green light. The left side of V1 was first struck by the front of V2; then the left front side of V1 was struck by the front of V3. V1 was towed due to damage.
V2 was a red 2000 Chevrolet Blazer 4 door SUV driven by a 21 year-old male with his 21 year-old girlfriend as the right front passenger. The driver of V2 had 12 hours of sleep the night before, and woke up rested. The driver was very familiar with the roadway since he drives it daily. At the time of the crash the driver and passenger were returning the passenger to work and listening to the radio. The driver of V2 saw approaching V1 but assumed that she would stop at the stoplight. V2 braked, but still slid into the left side of V1. After the impact with V1, V2 was contacted on the left side by the right front of V3, who was on the left side of V2 in the third lane. After the crash, V2 ended up against the left side of V1 facing northeast. Vehicle 2 was towed from the scene due to damage.
V3 was a black 1997 Nissan Altima 4 door sedan driven by a 40 year-old Middle Eastern female driver who did not speak English. It is unknown what, if any, medication the driver was under at the time of the crash. The person who translated for the driver said it was improper to ask that kind of information along with other personal information. V3 was heading east in the third lane approaching the intersection, when V1 crossed in front of V3. The driver of V3 tried to veer to the right to avoid V1, but contacted the left side of V2, then struck the left side of V1. V3 ended up facing east in the middle of the intersection at final rest. V3 was driven from the scene.
Vehicle 3 was not involved in first harmful event and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
