Case Summary #2007-43-117
This single-vehicle crash occurred on an urban three-lane, one-way roadway. This is a northbound road with a -4.6% grade and a +3.3% super-elevation. The road begins by curving left, it then straightens out for 25 meters (82 feet); it then curves sharply to the right for 63 meters (207 feet) before straightening back out. This road contains raised curbs and sidewalks on both sides with a posted speed limit of 56 kph (35 mph). Setting was evening hours on a weekday. Conditions were dusk, raining, wet roads with cloudy skies. Traffic flow was light. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
V1 is a 2002 Honda S2000, subcompact convertible with one occupant traveling northbound in lane three. V1 entered the right curve and intended to switch lanes to the right. V1 lost control in the roadway and began to rotate clockwise. V1 crossed all three lanes while rotating and struck the raised barrier curb. V1 went over the curb and struck an 80 cm diameter square concrete bridge support with its left side (Event 1). While V1 was fully engaged in the bridge support, it rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest against the support facing north,
The driver of V1 is a 29 year-old male who suffered a broken nose in the crash and was transported from the scene for treatment. He works 50 hours per week in the downtown business area. He had just left his office about 5 minutes prior to the crash and was on his way home. He stopped at the stoplight prior to the curve and remembers being the only car on the road. The light changed to green, so he proceeded forward in the far left lane at 56 kph (35 mph). After successfully negotiating the left section of the curve, he entered the right curve. Due to the sharpness of the curve, he decided to switch lanes to the right. As he switched lanes, his car suddenly lost control in the roadway and rotated clockwise toward the right side of the road. He looked left as his car with sliding, just in time to see himself impact a large concrete pillar with his left side. He then jumped out the window and flagged down a motorist to call for help. His car suffered disabling left-side damage and was towed from the scene.
