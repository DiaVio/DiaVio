This three-vehicle, rear-end crash occurred in the early evening hours on a weekday. It took place on a four-lane, two-way roadway, which was not physically divided. There were three lanes for westbound traffic and one lane for eastbound traffic. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with a slight downhill grade. The roadway precedes a four-way intersection, which was controlled by traffic lights in all directions. The posted speed limit was 64kmph (40mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, and traffic flow was normal. It should be noted that this researcher believes that sun glare was a factor because it was evident during travel to the crash site.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Honda CR-V, was heading west in lane two approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Ford Escort, was stopped in lane two, directly ahead of V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 1996 Hyundai Elantra, was also stopped in lane two in front of V2. The front of V1 contacted the back of V2. The impact then caused vehicle two to be pushed into the back of vehicle three. All three vehicles came to final rest shortly after impact in their original lane of travel. Vehicles one and two were towed from the scene, however vehicle three could be driven. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 17 year-old female, suffered possible injuries and was taken to the hospital for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. An interview was conducted with the mother of the driver. She related that her daughter was driving on the roadway, and the next thing she remembered were the airbags deploying. She informed me that her daughter has no record of any medical problems and her health is good. She recently started some topical medication for acne, but the mother did not know the names of the medication. She was not tired, but had only been driving for 5 weeks. The mother claimed that her daughter was familiar with the roadways. The vehicle had just been inspected and was in good working condition.
The driver of V2, a 21 year-old female suffered possible injuries but did not require transportation to a medical facility. There were four other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred, one of which was taken to the hospital for medical treatment. After numerous attempts, including one with the driver's lawyer, an interview could not be obtained. For this reason, it is unclear if any fatigue or health related factors contributed to this crash.
The driver of V3, a 57 year-old female, was not injured as a result of the crash, and did not require any medical attention. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from this driver. For this reason, it is unclear if any fatigue or medical related issues contributed to this crash.
There was no Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle because it was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, no Critical Reason could be coded to this vehicle. One associated factor coded to this vehicle was sun glare.
