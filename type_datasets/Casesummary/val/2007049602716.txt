This two-vehicle rear-end crash occurred at an intersection with traffic lights, on a weekday during early afternoon hours. The location was a four-lane divided (without positive barrier) straight, level, asphalt roadway. The speed limit is 56 kph (35 miles). The weather was clear and the roads dry. There was medium traffic at the time.
Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo with four doors and one occupant, was traveling north in the third lane of traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue with four doors and one occupant, was stopped at the red light at the intersection, ahead of V1. At the intersection, the front of V1 impacted the rear of V2. V2 was pushed forward into the intersection. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The drivers were not injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
A 20-year old male drove V1. He was following his friend, driving V2. They were both heading to a local repair shop to drop off V2. The parents of the driver of V2 own both vehicles. Both drivers had driven for about 10 minutes. The driver of V1 said he was following at a distance of about 4 car lengths, estimated to be 20 meters (66 feet). He said he did not realize his friend in V2 was stopped at the light. When he realized V2 was stopped, he noticed a semi-truck occupying lane two, making it impossible to change into lane two to avoid a collision. He applied the brakes and steered to the left instead. The driver was in good health and well rested. He does not take any medication. He possesses a valid driver's license and is familiar with the area. He had driven V1 before and was comfortable with the vehicle despite the fact it was not his own.
