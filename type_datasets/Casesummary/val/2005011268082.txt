The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way, two-lane road at the point where the road is oriented to the south just prior to a curve to the east. Conditions were dark, unlit, and foggy in the hour before daylight. The wet bituminous road had a posted speed limit of 64kph (40mph).
This is a Y intersection where the north/south road intersects the road that curves to the left running north/south to east/west. The crash took place at the base of the curve as it met the straight road heading north/south. This road was controlled by a stop sign, with an advance warning sign alerting drivers to the presence of the stop sign, prior to the intersection. This road also had a posted speed limit of 64kph (40mph). Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
Vehicle 2, a 1999 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling straight south (eastbound) on the road just approaching the curve to the left, in a line of vehicles slightly spread out. The driver of V2, a 35-year old male, saw headlights coming out of the dark, right in front of him, with no time for avoidance actions.
Vehicle 1, a 1991 Pontiac Grand Prix driven by a 43-year old male, was northbound on the north/south road. V1 stopped at the stop sign, looked for on-coming traffic from the north and westbound traffic coming from his right, and proceeded to go straight through the intersection, intending to cross the eastbound lane and travel westbound. The driver of V1 stated that as far as he could see, it was clear before he went. He also stated that due to the fog, he apparently could not see far enough ahead. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in the eastbound lane and pushed V2 toward the westbound lane.
V3, a 2004 Ford Taurus, was traveling straight, approximately 50 feet behind V2, driven by a 28-year old male. When V1 struck V2, and V2 came to a stop in the road partially in the westbound lane, the driver of V3 braked, with full ABS application, and tried to swerve to the right to avoid V2. The front left of V3 struck the back right of V2. V3 then attempted to travel to the right of V2 to avoid further damage, but V1 came to rest in the eastbound lane partially on the roadside, directly in the path of V3. The front left of V3 struck the left front and passenger area of V1. V1 was pushed to final rest facing northeast off of the road on the west side by V3.
V3 came to rest just off of the road on the west side and was drivable from the scene after the crash. The restrained driver of V3 was not reported as injured, and the airbags did not deploy. Although the other motor vehicle was stopped in the lane, the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to V3, as this vehicle was not involved in the first harmful event. V3 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of V2, described by the driver as 50' ahead of him in the fog, but the Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle, as this was a secondary impact. The 2004 Ford Taurus was a loaner, which the driver had picked up two days prior to the crash. The driver had been driving passenger cars for 12 years and seemed familiar with the type of vehicle and the roadway. The driver wears required lenses to correct a myopic condition, but has no other emotional, health, work or sleep-related issues. The driver was holding a cup of coffee in his right hand while steering with his left hand. He is properly licensed, and based on the vehicle inspection, V3 had no mechanical defects contributing to the crash.
