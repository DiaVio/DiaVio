This two-vehicle crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in an intersection between the main roadway of a parking lot and a connecting driveway. At the location of this crash, the main thoroughfare runs north and south with divisional islands on both sides separating the parking spaces. There are directional arrows and stop line markings painted on the ground indicating which direction vehicles are required to travel. There was a heavy rainstorm, and the roadway was wet at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1995 Toyota Celica with one occupant, was northbound on the lot's primary roadway. V2, a 1996 Ford F-350 with one occupant, was westbound, the wrong way, on a one-way driveway that intersects with the primary roadway. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1, pushing V1 onto a divisional island where it came to final rest. V2 came to final rest at the point of impact. V1 and V2 were both towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
A witness on-scene stated that he saw V2 rapidly crossing through the parking lot before colliding with V1. He was ignoring all traffic control devices in the parking lot.
