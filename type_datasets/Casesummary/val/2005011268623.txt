The crash occurred on a two-way, three lane, straight, level, bituminous roadway at an intersection controlled by stop signs for the two-way, two lane cross street. Conditions were clear and dry on the weekend afternoon, on the road with a posted speed limit of 80kmh (50mph). All three vehicles were heading westbound on the same road.
V3, a 1999 Ford Contour, driven by a 36 year-old male was stopped at the intersection in the left turn lane waiting for traffic to clear to complete a left turn. V2, a 1997 Eagle Talon driven by a 35 year-old female, was stopped behind v2, also waiting to turn left. V1, a 2001 Saturn SL2, driven by a 25 year-old male, was traveling near the posted speed limit looking for the street signs of the cross street. The driver of v1 who had moved from out of state 4 days prior to the crash, was unfamiliar not only with the road, but with the signage. The driver did not notice v2 and v3 stopped in the road ahead of him as he looked right and then left for the street sign. The front of v1 struck the back of v2, and the front of v2 then struck the back of v3. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
