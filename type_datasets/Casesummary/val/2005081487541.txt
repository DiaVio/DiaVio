This four-vehicle collision occurred in the morning during daylight hours in a busy 4-way intersection controlled by traffic and pedestrian signals. The three northbound lanes are straight and have a 2% downhill grade. The two eastbound lanes have an 8% uphill grade and are separated from westbound lanes by a 2-way center turn lane. There is one southbound lane. None of the roadways are divided; all were dry at the time of the crash and are of bituminous construction. The speed limit for both sections of roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear, traffic was moderately congested and there were no road defects or sight restrictions.
Vehicle one (V1), a light blue 1984 Mazda pickup, was northbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), an unknown hit and run vehicle was entering the northbound roadway from a private drive located on the west side of the roadway. V2 collided with the left side of V1 aft of the left rear axle, then left the scene; no further information is available on either the driver or vehicle. After impact with V2, V1 entered the oncoming lane, proceeded into the intersection, and the front of V1 and left side of vehicle three (V3), forward of the left front axle. V1 completed the left turn, entered the oncoming eastbound lane, and collided front to front with vehicle four (V4) that was stopped facing east. Both vehicles came to rest near the impact point. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
V3, a 1999 Pontiac Montana, was traveling northbound in lane two. V3 came to a controlled stop on the side of the westbound lanes after the impact with V1.
