The crash occurred at an intersection in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, rural roadway. The intersection was controlled with stop signs in the north and south directions only. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 88kmph (55 mph) in all directions. The eastbound approach of v1 was on level ground and curved to the right, while the southbound approach of v2 was on a 4% downhill grade. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was early afternoon hours on a weekend.
Vehicle one was a 2003 Acura 3.2TL sedan traveling eastbound negotiating a slight right curve. Vehicle two was a 1992 Nissan Sentra sedan stopped facing south. Both vehicles proceeded through the intersection. The front of v1 impacted the right side of v2. V1 traveled off the southeast corner of the intersection, impacting a stop sign with its front and coming to rest against the sign. V2 rotated clockwise 180 degrees before coming to rest on the east roadside several car lengths down the southbound roadway away from the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.
The Acura sedan (V1) was driven by a 29-year old female who was accompanied by three passengers. She was reported to have possible injuries, but was not transported from the scene. She stated that she was heading home from the veterinarian when the other vehicle pulled in front of her from the left. She didn't have a chance to react before the collision. Her estimated speed was 50 mph. The Acura sedan was towed due to damage.
The Nissan sedan (V2) was driven by a 17-year old female with one other passenger. She and her passenger were transported to a local hospital with possible injuries. She stated that she was heading to her grandma's house on a road she drives daily. She claims to have looked both ways but was not able to see the oncoming vehicle due to roadway curvature and trees. Images from the scene reconstruction dispute this claim. This driver estimated her speed at 5 mph, and was also not able to react before the collision. The Nissan sedan was towed due to damage.
