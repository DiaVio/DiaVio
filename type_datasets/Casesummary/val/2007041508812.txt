The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, seven-lane roadway, which was divided by a curbed median. There were four southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2004 GMC Sierra with one occupant, was traveling southbound, weaving in and out of multiple lanes, zigzagging through traffic. V2, a 2006 BMW 325Ci with one occupant, was stopped facing east, preparing to enter the roadway from a parking lot. As V2 pulled onto the roadway, the front of V2 made contact with the right rear tire of V1. After impact, the back of V1 rotated counterclockwise while continuing in a southbound direction. The left rear tire rim made contact with the curbed median. V1 continued southbound another sixty to seventy-five meters, rotating 180Â°, coming to final rest on the roadway facing north. V2 came to final rest near the point of impact. Both V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The GMC Sierra was driven by an 18-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way to pick up his girlfriend before going to a restaurant. The driver indicated that he was traveling in lane three at a speed of approximately 72 kmph (45 mph). The motorist denied witness reports that he was racing, or weaving in and out of traffic. The driver insisted he was merely following behind another vehicle, when the driver of V2 pulled out. The motorist also contradicted a report that the driver of V2 was making a right turn out of the parking lot. The driver of V1 believed that the other motorist was attempting to cross the path of V1 in order to make a left turn. According to the driver of V1, contact was made in lane three, not lane one. This could not be verified, however. The driver of V1 declared that he was not treated fairly at the scene of the crash, and that the police showed bias against him due to his age.
The BMW 325Ci was driven by a 78-year old male, who refused treatment. He stated that he had just left a restaurant and was preparing to make a right turn out of the parking lot. The driver said that when he looked left, there was no one in his travel lane. He was taken completely by surprise when he was hit, as he turned right, out of the parking lot exit.
