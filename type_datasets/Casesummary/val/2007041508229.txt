This crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a two-way, eight-lane roadway, which was divided by a curbed median. There were five northbound lanes, with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). This was a bituminous, straight, and level roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
V1, a 2006 Toyota Matrix with one occupant, was northbound in lane four. V2, a 1996 Ford Explorer with two occupants, was also northbound in lane four ahead of V1. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. V1 was traveling at a higher rate of speed. V2 entered the intersection while V1 failed to adjust its speed. The front of V1 struck the back of V2. After impact, V2 continued northbound, coming to final rest near the center median. V1 continued northbound as well, rotating in a counterclockwise direction. V1 traveled approximately 35 meters from point of impact, before coming to final rest in the northbound travel lanes. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1 and 113 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1, a 26-year old female, was transported for treatment of non-incapacitating injuries. She stated that she was on her way home from her boyfriend's house. She claimed that she approached the intersection in the left turn lane, coming to a complete stop due to a red traffic light. The driver said she was the first of two or three vehicles in the left turn lane, and had intended to make a U-turn when the light turned green. She indicated that as she entered the intersection (on a green arrow), she was struck by V2. She said that she did not see the other vehicle prior to impact, and did not know which direction the other driver came from. The driver's statement conflicted with vehicle damage patterns, as well as physical evidence at the scene.
The driver of V2, a 47-year old female, suffered minor injuries but was not transported. She stated that it was her daughter's first day at a new job, and she was driving her to work. As they were driving, she noticed in her rearview mirror that a car in her lane was rapidly overtaking her. As V1 got closer, the driver started to think she would be hit from behind. As the driver entered the intersection, she started to move to her left to get out of the way. She was still in the process of moving over, when she saw the other driver swerve to the right at the last second. The driver said that the other motorist clipped the back right corner of her SUV, and then spun around two or three complete times.
