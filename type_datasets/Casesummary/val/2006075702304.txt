This two-vehicle crash occurred on a rural three-lane, undivided highway. In the northbound direction, there are two travel lanes and the roadway is straight and uphill. In the southbound direction, there is a single travel lane and the roadway is straight and downhill. The posted speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours on a weekend afternoon. Traffic flow was light.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Focus with one occupant, was southbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu with one occupant, was southbound in lane one in front of V1. The driver of V2 saw a non-contact vehicle heading northbound in lane two pull into the southbound lane before it turned left onto a gravel driveway. The driver of V2 quickly applied the brakes and V2 was hit in the left rear by the right front of V1. V2 lost control and departed the roadway on the right. The driver of V2 overcorrected with a sharp left turn, which sent V2 into a counterclockwise yaw. V2 quickly reached a trip point when it was approximately perpendicular to the roadway, facing east-southeast, and rolled two quarter turns. V2 came to rest facing east-northeast on its top. V1 drove to a controlled stop on the roadside just before the point of V2's rollover. V1 was towed due to minor front-end damage; V2 was towed due to moderate top damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.
