A three-vehicle daytime intersection type collision occurred in the intersection of two one-way urban arterial roadways. The southbound roadway has three lanes, is concrete with a steady downhill grade of -7%. Parallel parking is allowed on both sides of the street. The westbound roadway also has three lanes, is also concrete, and has a downhill grade of -8% before and after the intersection. The speed limit for both roads is 48 Kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the road was dry.
Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet T10 pickup with only a driver, was traveling south in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 1988 Ford Festiva hatchback with only a driver, was heading west in lane two. Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Ford Expedition SUV with only a driver, was heading west in lane three adjacent to V2. V1 entered the intersection as V2 and V3 were crossing, and the front of V1 stuck the right front of V2. V2 was pushed into the right side of V3. V1 rotated clockwise ninety degrees, and came to rest in the intersection. V2 rotated forty-five degrees and came to rest in the intersection. V3 rotated clockwise and the left rear tire folded under and the left rear rim caught on the concrete pavement. V3 then rolled onto its roof and came to rest facing east. All vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. Only the driver of V3 was transported due to injury. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 54-year old male familiar with the road, on his way to work having just dropped his wife off several blocks north. The driver stated that he normally catches steady green lights along this road, and was not expecting a red light. Before entering the intersection, he was looking inside the vehicle to drink his coffee. The driver suffers from neck problems and has high blood pressure. He had missed work the prior week due to medical problems. He also stated he had some financial problems.
A 55-year old female who refused to be interviewed for this study drove V3. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. A critical reason was not assigned to this vehicle.
