This crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the middle of a suburban intersection. The intersection consisted of physically divided (grassy median) six-lane north/south roadway and a physically divided (grassy median) four-lane east/west roadway controlled by a properly function traffic signal. The bituminous north/south roadway was dry and level with a slight curve right as on traveled southbound. The roadway featured a speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The traffic flow was heavy as it was morning rush hour, but there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V2, a 2006 Mitsubishi Outlander with one occupant, was traveling Northbound in one approaching the same intersection where it intended to continue straight. As V1 began turning left it was struck on the right side by the front of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the northbound lanes in the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.
