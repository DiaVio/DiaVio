V1, a Honda Odyssey minivan with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one when it entered the intersection without stopping for a red light. V2, a 1999 Chrysler Concorde 4-door with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one when it entered the intersection. The drivers of both vehicles did not see the other vehicle until the collision occurred and did not have time to avoid the collision. V1's left front struck the right front quarter panel of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest within a couple of meters of point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, the Honda Odyssey, was driven by a 37-year-old male who reported no injuries. The driver stated that he was traveling approximately the speed limit, 40 kmph (25 mph), when he passed through the intersection. The driver claimed that he had a yellow light when he entered the intersection and it must have turned red once he was already in the intersection. The driver was running an errand to the store before going to work this morning. He stated he was not in a hurry and did nothing to avoid the accident since he did not see V2 until it hit him.
V2, the Chrysler Concorde, was driven by a 20-year-old female who reported no injuries. The driver stated that she was on her way to work and was stopped at the intersection with a red light for about 30 seconds. Then the light turned green and she proceeded into the intersection and felt the impact. Until this point, she did not see V1, since she was looking straight ahead the whole time and not looking around the intersection. The driver stated that she could not have been going more than 16-24 kmph (10-15 mph) at the time of the collision because she was coming from a complete stop.
