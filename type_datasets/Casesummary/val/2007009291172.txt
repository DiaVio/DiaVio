There was alcohol found in the pick-up and the driver admitted to smoking marijuana prior to the crash. The driver stated that they were traveling south in lane one after leaving the driver's home intending to get hamburgers. As they approached the intersection, the driver suddenly decided to return home, claiming that he used the turn signal, he steered left into lane two. He didn't remember another vehicle traveling next to him in lane two prior to his steering left. Once he entered lane two, something hit the left side of V1, causing his vehicle to spin counter clock-wise 90 degrees before coming to rest across lane two. V1 came to rest facing east against the guardrail south of the intersection. After being confronted by police about the odor of marijuana in his vehicle, he admitted that prior to the crash; he had seen a police cruiser with flashing lights stopped on the road ahead. In a panicked attempt to avoid passing the cruiser, he decided to make a u-turn at the intersection and return home. After the crash, the driver exited V1 and threw his "pipe" and marijuana into the grass median". The passenger in V1 stated that he had no idea what happened. The driver was transported for possible injuries; his passenger was later transported for unknown injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver stated that she had been traveling south in lane two at a rate of 92 kmph (57 mph) on her way home after stopping by her mother's house. She had been traveling slightly behind V1 in the adjacent lane for about a mile, when the driver of V1 suddenly turned his vehicle in front of hers. She had no time to react when the left side of V1 slammed into the right front side of V2. The force of the crash caused V2 to decelerate suddenly, coming to rest in lane two at the south end of the intersection. The driver and her husband had also seen the lights of the police cruiser stopped ahead and assumed that the driver of V1 had attempted the sudden left or u-turn to avoid passing the cruiser. The husband confronted the driver of V1 after the crash, but the driver of V1 denied any knowledge of what happened. The husband also smelled the marijuana on the driver of V1.
