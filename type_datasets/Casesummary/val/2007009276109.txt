This crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the southbound lanes of a divided limited access highway. The north/south highway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a wide grassy median. The bituminous highway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1997 Toyota Camry with two occupants, was southbound in lane one. V2, a 2001 International school bus with four occupants was also southbound in lane one in front of V2. V1 failed to keep a safe distance and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. V1 was disabled and was towed from the scene due to damage. Upon this researcher's arrival, V2 had already left the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
