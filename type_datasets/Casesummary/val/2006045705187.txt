This crash occurred on a primary arterial road that ran east/west, and was divided by a grassy median. The roadway was composed of three eastbound lanes with the first lane designated as a right turn only lane for an upcoming side street. The arterial was bordered on the southeast side by a guardrail that began just past the side street and curved right to follow parallel to the arterial on the south side. The arterial was straight and level and the portion of side street pertinent to this crash was also level. The speed limit on the arterial was 72 kmph (45 mph). The roadway was dark and unlit on a weekday night.
V1, a 1993 Ford Ranger, was eastbound in the right lane of the roadway and crossed into the right turn only lane (still traveling relatively straight) and crossed the side street, departing the right roadside and struck the part of the guardrail at the side street head on with the front plane of V1. V1 destroyed about 6 meters of guardrail and came to rest on top of the guardrail posts facing east. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
