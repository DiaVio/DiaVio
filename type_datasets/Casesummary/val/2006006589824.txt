This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday in a mid-block section of a four-lane divided urban roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of two lanes in each direction with curbside parking lanes divided by raised (15cm) cement median. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight and featured a positive grade of 7%. The posted speed limit was 56kmph (35 mph). The roadway was dark, but illuminated by overhead streetlights. Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1991 Toyota Corolla, was northbound in lane two when it drifted left and contacted the raised median with its left rear tire. The impact caused the left rear tire to blow out and the vehicle lost control. V1 crossed back over the northbound lanes of traffic and contacted the concrete barrier on the right roadside. V1 continued traveling scraping the concrete barrier while riding the curb for several meters and blew out the left front tire when the tire contacted the curb edge. V1 traveled several more meters onto the roadway rotating clockwise where it came to final rest facing eastward. V1 was towed due to severe damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.
The driver of V1, a 19-year old male, said he was traveling north in lane two and began to daydream and didn't realize he was drifting left. As he began to focus he slammed his brakes and steered to the right. He heard a noise and realized his back tire had blown out. He loss control of the vehicle, jumped the curb, and slammed into the wall. That's when, he said, his other tire, front left, blew out. He travels this route daily and is comfortable with the roadway. He was transported to the hospital with minor injuries.
