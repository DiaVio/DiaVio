This crash occurred in the northbound lane of an undivided two-lane highway. There was a slight left curve in the southbound direction, and the roadway was level and dry. The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph). It was early afternoon on a weekday. The weather was clear and traffic flow was light. The northbound lane had a 2.5m shoulder with a guardrail on the edge of the roadway.
V1 was a 1998 Toyota Camry driven by a 47-year old female traveling in the southbound lane. V2 was a 2003 Ford F-550 driven by a 44-year old male traveling in the northbound lane. For an unknown reason, V1 crossed the centerline of the roadway, encroaching into the northbound lane. The driver of V2 saw V1 coming into his lane and pulled his vehicle as far to the right as possible, nearly coming into contact with the guardrail. V1 continued into the northbound lane and struck V2, which was now partially on the shoulder, in the cargo portion of the vehicle. V1 spun around after impact, coming to final rest in the southbound lane, facing north. V2's back-end was pushed up onto the guardrail, which then caused the vehicle to roll four-quarter turns and come to final rest with its backend still on the guardrail. The driver of V1 suffered fatal injuries; the driver of V2 suffered minor injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
