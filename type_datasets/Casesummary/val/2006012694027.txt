This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a four-way intersection. The intersection consisted of a two-way, five-lane north/south roadway and a two-way, five-lane east/west roadway controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. Each roadway consisted of two lanes in each direction with a middle lane serving as a designated left turn lane. Both roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level and featured a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was eastbound in the turn lane as it intended to turn left at the intersection. V2, a 1997 Ford Taurus GL, was westbound in lane one approaching the same intersection where it intended to go straight. As V1 began it's left turn towards the northbound lanes it was contacted on the right side by the front of V2. The impact caused V1 to begin rotating clockwise before coming to final rest in the northbound lanes just past the intersection. After impact V2 departed the roadway over the northwest corner and came to final rest in a parking lot on the northwest side of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1 was driven by a 71 year-old female that stated she is in fair health due to a recent bout with cancer. She was taking numerous medications as treatment of this condition. She also wears prescription lenses that correct a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition. She was on her way home from a luncheon at the time of the crash. She stated she was the third vehicle back in the left turn lane. As the other two vehicles made there turns she claimed she checked for oncoming traffic, but saw none. She thought it was clear to turn. She stated as her vehicle was contacted she looked to her right but the right side curtain airbags deployed and she could not tell were the other vehicle came from. The driver was transported due to minor injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.
V2 was driven by a 57 year-old female in good health who only needs corrective lenses for reading. She stated that she was on her way to the bank with several friends. She stated even though she was talking to the other occupants in the vehicle she noted the Jeep in the left turn lane and had slowed a little to see what the driver was going to do because another vehicle had just made a left turn in-front of the Jeep. She stated at the last minute the Jeep turned and there was no place to go. After contacting the right side of the Jeep she stated she saw her occupant hit the windshield and that the air bags did not deploy (this researcher found out during the interview that the airbags in this vehicle had deployed during a previous accident). The driver and the passenger in the right front seat were transported for treatment of various injuries and V2 was towed due to damage.
