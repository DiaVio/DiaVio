The crash occurred on a westbound 5-lane interstate divided by a double guardrail on the left and a thick forest on the right. Both sides of the roadway had shoulders on this dry, straight, level, bituminous road with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). Traffic was heavy in all lanes during the weekday early morning at dawn. The sky was dark and cloudy. There was an existing five-vehicle collision in the westbound lane four.
The current crash occurred following stabilization of a previous crash that involved five vehicles, two of which were then part of this crash. The driver of the first vehicle (a 2006 Honda Element) had been rear-ended when he had to slam on his brakes to avoid a non-contact vehicle in front of him. He was successful in avoiding a collision with the vehicle ahead of him but was rear-ended by the vehicle traveling behind him, a 2007 Toyota Avalon. After this crash, the 2007 Toyota Avalon was rear-ended by another vehicle, a 2001 Jeep Cherokee. The Jeep Cherokee was then rear-ended by V3, which was then rear-ended by V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
V1, a 2003 Hyundai Accent four-door sedan, was driven by a 54 year-old female. She stated that she had left home 25 minutes prior to the crash and was on her way to work. The driver of V1 was traveling west in lane four at a rate of 105 kmph (65 mph) when the vehicle a distance ahead of her stopped suddenly (V2, which had been involved in the previous crash). In an unsuccessful attempt to avoid a collision, she braked hard, unable to change lanes due to surrounding traffic. Her vehicle continued forward, without skidding or lock-up, until the front of V1 struck and went under the rear of V2. The driver of V1 stated that her brakes seemed to work fine, but her vehicle just kept going forward. The driver of V1 was transported due to injuries from the airbag.
V2, a 2003 Toyota Avalon four-door sedan, was driven by a 48 year-old male traveling with his 39 year-old wife. The driver stated that he had left home ten minutes prior to the crash and was on his way to work. The driver stated that he had been stopped for a few seconds in lane four after being involved in a minor front-end collision when his vehicle was suddenly jolted forward and up from the rear. This was caused by the front of V1 striking the rear of his vehicle. The driver of V2 was unaware of V1's approach until after the crash. The occupants of V2 were not transported but the passenger of V2 was later driven to the hospital for shoulder pain.
V3, a 2002 Volkswagen Passat four-door sedan, was driven by a 32 year-old male. The driver stated that he had left home ten minutes prior on his way to work. The driver stated that he had been stopped for a few seconds in lane four after being involved in a front-end collision with another vehicle and a rear-end collision with V2. He became aware of V1 when his vehicle was suddenly jolted forward from the rear for a second time by V2 due to V2 being rear-ended by V1. The driver was uninjured.
