The crash occurred on a two-way, two lane, rural, slag road with a statutory speed limit of 89kmh (55mph). Conditions were clear, dark, unlighted and dry on the straight and level road, in the late evening hours at the beginning of the weekend. V1, a 1983 Ford Crown Victoria, was traveling westbound when it left the road on the left side and the front of v1 struck and broke a small metal sign post and then struck a utility pole. V1 came to rest facing southwest against the pole. The wooden utility pole (26cm diameter) remained upright, but a high voltage wire at the top of the pole was knocked loose and hung below the remaining wires. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.
The driver was familiar with his vehicle and drives that roadway every once in a while with the same passenger. No vehicle defects were found during inspection. Police coded 'speed too fast' on their report as a Hazardous Action, but did not issue a citation for speeding. The driver was not fatigued, reported no stress related issues, or medical conditions per passenger and was not in a hurry. The driver was properly licensed with no restrictions.
