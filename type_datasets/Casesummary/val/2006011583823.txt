V1, a 2006 Buick Lucerne 4-door sedan, was eastbound in lane 1 of two eastbound lanes of a straight, level, bituminous 4-lane, interstate. The east and westbound lanes were separated by a grass median. The posted speed limit was 113 kmph (70 mph). At the time of the crash, it was daylight and the roadway was dry.
V1 was driven by a 76-year old female. Ten minutes before the crash, she had just picked up V1 at the dealership. She had driven approximately 5 miles when she came upon a slower-moving truck in her lane. She decided to change lanes to the left to pass the truck. As V1 began to enter lane 2, a non-contact vehicle that had been following V1 swung out into lane 2 at a high rate of speed to pass V1. The driver of V1 swerved right, lost control and exited the roadway to the right in a clockwise yaw. V1 continued to rotate clockwise while sliding off the road and struck a tree with its back end. V1 came to rest facing west. Neither the driver nor her 78-year old passenger was injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
