The crash occurred on a suburban, two-lane, undivided, bituminous roadway. The roadway was oriented in an east to west direction with occasional driveway and neighborhood accesses. The posted speed was 72 KMPH (45 MPH). Roadway grade was a minimal 0-1% downhill with approximately 5% super elevation for all lanes. Conditions were foggy for this early dawn weekday crash.
Vehicle #1 was a 2004 Ford Mustang coupe facing west and stopped for traffic ahead waiting to turn left into a neighborhood entrance. Vehicle #2 was a 2005 Ford F350 Super Duty Crew Cab approaching eastbound in the oncoming lane of traffic. Vehicle #3 was a 2000 Ford F150 Supercab traveling westbound, approaching V1 from behind. V3 did not reduce speed as it approached V1 and subsequently steered left across the roadway to avoid colliding with V1. The front of V2 then contacted the right side of V3, causing V3 to roll left one-quarter turn onto its left side in the south roadside. V2 was steering left and braking at the time of the collision in an effort to avoid the collision. This maneuver caused the front of V2 to impact the left side of V1. V2 came to rest facing southwest in the roadway. V1 came to rest facing northwest in the north roadside. Police Reported Travel Speed is 0 kmph for V1 and 0 kmph for V2.
The Ford Mustang (V1) was driven by a 33-year old female who reported possible injuries but was not transported. She stated that she saw V3 approaching in her rear view mirror and felt a crash was imminent. The Mustang was towed, but not due to damage.
No Critical Precrash Event and no Critical Reason were coded to the driver of the Mustang because she was not involved in the first harmful event (the impact between the F350 and the F150). The driver of V1 was familiar with both her vehicle and the roadway, and was taking no medications. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. The weather (fog) was coded as an associated factor for all involved drivers.
The Ford F350 (V2) was driven by a 32-year old male who reported possible injuries but was not transported. He stated that he could see traffic in the oncoming lane stopped waiting to turn left when the last vehicle (V3) swerved around the others and into his direct path. He braked and steered left, striking both V3 and V1. The F350 was towed due to damage.
The Ford F150 (V3) was driven by a 19-year old male who suffered police-reported non-incapacitating injuries and was transported to a local trauma center. The driver had to be extricated from the vehicle by emergency personnel due to vehicle crush and damage. He was not willing to be interviewed for this crash. The F150 was towed due to damage.
