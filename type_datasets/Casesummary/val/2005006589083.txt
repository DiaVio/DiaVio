The two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection. The northbound roadway (Vehicle 1) was a two lane undivided asphalt, dry, and level roadway. The eastbound roadway (Vehicle 2) was also a two lane undivided roadway; however, there were metal trolley tracks planted in cement on both sides of the roadway. The posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25mph) for all directions. The intersection was controlled by signalized traffic lights without pedestrian crossing for all directions. The crash occurred in the early afternoon on a weekend. There were no adverse weather conditions and traffic flow was normal.
Vehicle 2, a 1995 Mazda Millenia, was traveling eastbound, speed unknown, and was crossing through the intersection when its front contacted the left front side of Vehicle 1, a 1995 Honda Accord. The police report indicated that it was unknown as to which vehicle had the right of way; however, scene evidence, vehicle damage, and final resting points indicated that Vehicle 2 ran the red light. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
The driver of Vehicle 2, a 30-year old female, was issued several citations. One of the violations was for driving a motor vehicle without a valid driver's license. The other was for driving with illegal movement and another for not having the vehicle properly insured. The driver of Vehicle 2 was unavailable for an interview. She was taken from the scene to the hospital with minor injuries.
The driver of Vehicle 1, a 24-year old female, stated that she had the right of way and had the green light.
