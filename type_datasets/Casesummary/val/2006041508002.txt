The crash occurred at the intersection of two roadways. The east/west roadway was a two-way, seven-lane, uncontrolled street, divided by a concrete curbed median. The north/south roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street, controlled by a stop sign. These were straight, level, asphalt roads, with an east/west posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). Conditions were dark with streetlights on a weekend evening. The roads were dry with clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.
Both vehicles were initially traveling in opposite directions on the east/west roadway, approaching the same intersection. V1, a 2005 Nissan 350Z with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane three. V2, a 2001 Suzuki GSX motorcycle with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. V1, which was going east, attempted to turn left at an area that was designated for westbound traffic only. V1 traveled through the safety zone of the westbound left turn lane, crossing into the westbound travel lanes. The front of V2 made contact with the right rear quarter panel area of V1. The driver of the motorcycle, who was not wearing a helmet, was instantly ejected. V2 came to final rest on the northwest corner of the intersection. After impact, V1 spun counterclockwise, coming to final rest between lanes one and two of the north/south roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.
V1, the 350Z, was driven by a 26-year old male, who was not injured. He could not be reached for interview.
V2, the GSX motorcycle, was driven by a 34-year old male, who was killed in the crash. A surrogate interview was conducted for the fatally injured driver. The driver and a friend were traveling to the driver's mother's house, from a motorcycle rally. The proximity of the other driver's left turn in front of the motorcycle left the driver of the bike no time to take any avoidance actions, other than maybe a brief attempt by the cyclist to apply brakes.
