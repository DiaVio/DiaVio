This five-vehicle crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a painted median. This was a straight, uphill grade, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). It was early afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was moderate. Traffic was stopped at an intersection with traffic control signals.
Vehicle five (V5), a 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser with one occupant, was stopped in traffic in lane 2 behind non-contact vehicles waiting for the traffic signal to turn green. Vehicle four (V4), a 1979 Nissan 280ZX with one occupant, was stopped behind V5. Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Honda Civic with two occupants was stopped in lane 2 behind V4. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 E-series van with two occupants, was stopped in traffic behind V3. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 GMC Envoy with one occupant, was also traveling northbound approaching the intersection. The front of V1 struck the rear of V2 which initiated a chain reaction: the front of V2 struck the rear of V3 which was pushed forward and the front of V3 struck the rear of V4 which in turn the front struck the rear of V5. All five vehicles came to rest north of the impact point facing north in lane two. V1, V2 and V3 were towed from the scene; V4 and V5 were driven. The passenger in V2 was transported with possible injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 was a 47 year-old female who refused to be interviewed. Information obtained from the vehicle indicated the vehicle was traveling in a speed range of 56-64 kmph (35-40 mph) prior to impact and at impact. The driver did not attempt any braking prior to impact. The impact did not deploy the frontal air bags.
A 54 year-old male, who reported no injuries, drove V2. The vehicle was manufactured as an incomplete vehicle and fitted as a cargo van that was equipped with a wheel chair lift. The roof had been modified (raised) to enhance the vertical distance for disabled passengers. The driver is familiar with the vehicle and drives the route weekly. The driver was not injured and the passenger in the second row left position was transported as a precautionary measure. The driver and the occupant went out to lunch and were on their way to a doctor's appointment when the crash occurred. He had driven 6.5 kilometers (four miles) and was not in a hurry. The driver states his son is disabled and had the van equipped with a wheel chair lift and all equipment that goes with it. He wear glasses for reading only and does not take medications or drugs. He works out on a regular basis of three days a week for 45 minutes. He works 50 hours a week, with eight hours being his shortest and nine hour being his longest. He slept eight hours the night before the crash at home, and usually gets five hours and stated he had a lot of sleep.
A 24 year-old male drove V3. He and the occupant were from out of town and had just left a friend's house to find a bookstore. He had driven about ten kilometers (six miles), was talking to the occupant and was not in a hurry prior to the crash. The driver was in town for a concert later that night and was very excited about it. He was not going to let this crash stop him from going. The driver stated his health is fair because he smokes; he does not take any medications or drugs. His normal sleep is six to eight hours, but the night before the crash he slept ten hours at a friend's house. He worked a total of three hours the week before, which is normal, since he also goes to school.
V4 and V5 were not included in this in-depth study. Vehicle inspection and driver interviews were not required.
