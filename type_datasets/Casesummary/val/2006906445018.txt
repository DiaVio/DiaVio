This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on the right (east) roadside of an undivided, urban roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction divided by a two-way center left turn lane and flanked by parking lanes 3.4 meters on each side. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed of 64 kmph (30 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1994 Toyota Corolla four door with two occupants, was northbound in lane one. As V1 continued north it drifted right, entered the eastside parking lane, and partially departed the roadway. V1's front right tire blew out from the impact with the curb. V1 then continued north 10.5 m until the front of V1 struck the rear of V2, a legally parked 1997 Pontiac Bonneville. Upon impact both vehicles traveled approximately 3-meters north and came to their final rests. At final rest V2 was still in its parking lane and V1 was still partially on the curb and partially in the parking lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 49 year-old female, advised that she had just taken and failed for a second time the state driver's licensing exam and was now on her way home. She had originally learned to drive when she was sixteen years old in her birth country but she had not driven for at least eight years prior to the three months before the crash. She claimed that she had been talking with her passenger, an uncle, when she unexplainably lost control of the vehicle and partially departed the roadway. V1 than struck the curb fairly hard and that the impact flattened one of the tires. The driver acknowledged that she had been using her handheld cell phone as she had been driving but insisted that she had not been using the cell phone at the time when she lost control of V1. When questioned further about the loss of control the driver advised that that she had started to feel dizzy and that is when she lost control (there was no mention of the driver feeling ill in the police report and V1 driver had already stated that her health was "excellent"). She was not injured but her passenger, who was sitting in the front seat, was taken to a medical facility for treatment of minor injuries.
