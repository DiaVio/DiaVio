This single vehicle crash occurred during early afternoon on a weekend. The roadway was a one lane, one-way freeway off-ramp. The road surface was dry, bituminous with a -7% negative grade. The off-ramp started straight then curved to the right with a positive super elevation. There are chevron curve warning signs posted along the off-ramp curve. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, visibility was clear and traffic was light. The speed limit on the freeway was 97 kmph, 60 mph.
Vehicle one (V1), a1990 Lincoln Town Car four door sedan, was traveling southbound in the #1 lane on the freeway. As V1 exited the freeway the driver lost control prior to entering the off-ramp curve. The vehicle rotated in a clockwise yaw, departed the roadway and struck a guardrail with the back of the vehicle. The vehicle traveled along the guardrail and came to rest facing east on the right shoulder. The driver stated the rear tire blew out and the vehicle had a bad suspension. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 25-year-old male, was wearing a lap & shoulder belt and was not injured. A 26-year-old male passenger (not listed on the police report) was seated in the right front seat. It is unknown if he was belted. The driver was well rested, in good health with no medical problems. The vehicle was borrowed from a friend, but he stated he had driven it several times. He was on his way to a soccer game, but stated he was not in a hurry. His statement that the soccer game started at 1430 hours, which was 45 minutes before the time of the crash, contradicted this. So it was then reasoned the driver was in a hurry.
