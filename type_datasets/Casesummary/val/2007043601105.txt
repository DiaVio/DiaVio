This two-vehicle case occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on a 2-lane undivided roadway. The roadway is a north/south thoroughfare that passes through a suburban neighborhood and college community. Near the location of this crash, the northbound roadway has a curve to the left and downhill slope while the southbound roadway is straight with an uphill slope. The bituminous roadway is dry with a posted limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and the weather was clear and daylight.
V1, a 2005 Volkswagon New Beetle with two occupants, was southbound going straight. V2, a 1993 Nissan Maxima with one occupant, was northbound on the same road rounding a curve to the left. V2 partially departed the right side of the road, re-entered the road and entered the southbound lane where it struck V1 head-on. Both vehicles were towed from the scene sue to disabling damage but only V1's passenger and V2's driver were transported from the scene for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 19-year-old female and full time college student that was returning home from class with her friend when V2 crossed the double yellow lines and struck her Volkswagon head-on. She reports that she was southbound when V2 rounded a curve and drove into her lane. She thinks she may have steered right before the collision but she is not certain. She was treated on the scene by EMS but she refused to be transported to the hospital by an ambulance but she visited the hospital later in the day when her parents advised she needed treatment.
The driver of V2 is a 22-year-old female that is also a full-time college student that was traveling north from her apartment to campus for a class. She had only driven one mile from her home when, while negotiating a curve to the left, her car drove off the right side off the road, and after she re-entered the roadway she continued into the southbound lane where she struck V1 head-on. She was transported directly from the scene to trauma center where she was hospitalized and treated for a broken bone in her neck, a broken ankle, and several broken ribs. She was too traumatized from the crash to remember any details about the crash.
