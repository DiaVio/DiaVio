Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Acura Integra LS 2 door hatchback, was southbound, stopped at a red traffic signal at the intersection intending to turn left. The V2 driver, a 31 year old male, was watching a pedestrian in the crosswalk to his left, who was crossing from south to north. The traffic signal turned green, and the V2 driver pulled forward, but paused to allow the pedestrian to cross, then entered the intersection and was struck in the left side by V1. The impact with V1 caused V2 to enter a clockwise rotation and V2 came to rest in the northwest corner of the intersection facing generally east. V2 was towed due to damage.
