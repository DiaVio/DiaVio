This crash occurred in the evening of a weekend in the northbound lanes of an undivided rural roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of fives lanes of travel (two in each direction with a center left turn lane). The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred where the turn lane ended and the roadway narrowed to four lanes of travel. The traffic flow was normal but roadway was dark and unlit and the skies were cloudy at the time of the crash.
V1, a 2004 Chevrolet Suburban with three occupants, was northbound in lane two. V2, a 2004 Dodge Ram with one occupant, was also northbound in lane two ahead of V1. As V2 slowed to a stop and prepared to make a left turn into a gas station V1 failed to stop behind it and rear-ended V2. The force of impact pushed V2 forward roughly 71m (233 ft.) before it came to final rest in its original travel lane. V1 traveled to the left into oncoming traffic lane before coming to final rest in lane one of the southbound lanes. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
The driver of V1, a 40 year-old female, along with her two passengers suffered minor injuries as a result of the crash but did not require transport. She was on her way home from visiting her mothers with her children at the time of the crash. The surrogate who gave the interview stated that the driver did not see any brake lights and did not realize the vehicle ahead had stopped. She stated when she did see the vehicle it was too late. She stated the only thing she remembered after the start of the crash was glass flying in her face.
The driver of V2, a 27 year-old male, suffered minor injuries as a result of the crash but did not require transport. He stated he was on his way home from hunting when he realized he needed gas. He stated he put on his left turn signal and stopped were the roadway narrowed to 4 lanes. As he sat waiting for southbound traffic to clear he was struck from behind. He stated he felt glass hitting him in the back of the head and then he was looking at the interior roof. He stated as he sat back up he felt the vehicle rolling like it had a flat tire and he saw he was still in lane two of travel. He stated he pulled the vehicle into a driveway rather than leaving it in the roadway.
