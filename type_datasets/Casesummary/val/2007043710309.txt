This three-vehicle crashed occurred at an urban signal-controlled four-legged intersection with no pedestrian crosswalks, but did contain raised barrier curbs and sidewalks. The primary roadway runs north/south and is divided by a grass median. The west road contains five lanes and is undivided. The east road contains five lanes divided by a raised concrete divider. Westbound approach is straight with a +3% grade. Southbound approach is straight with a +5% grade. Eastbound approach is straight with a +6.5% grade. Setting was afternoon hours on a weekday. Conditions were daylight, cloudy and dry. Traffic flow was congested in the area due to heavy rush hour volume combined with the traffic signals not functioning properly.
V1 is 2005 Ford Five Hundred, four-door, full-size with one occupant traveling westbound in lane two. V2 is a 1999 Dodge Stratus four-door, intermediate with one occupant traveling southbound in lane two. V3 is a 1999 Chevrolet G3500 work van with six occupants traveling eastbound in lane three, the left turn lane. The traffic signals at this intersection were not functioning properly at the time of the crash. They were on flash mode for unknown reasons with no police officers present for traffic control. Northbound traffic despite having a flashing yellow light had stopped to allow westbound traffic to cross. V2 who was traveling south had a flashing yellow light and entered the intersection at 72 kph (45 mph). V1 successfully crossed over northbound lanes and proceeded across southbound lanes. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time. V2 applied its brakes and steered right to avoid a collision, but was unsuccessful. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1 in the southbound lanes of the intersection (event 1). The right side of V1 then contacted the left side of V2 in a side slap fashion (event 2). V1 then traveled 25.5 meters (84 feet) in a left (south) path and came to rest facing south along the southwest corner of the intersection. V2 proceeded on a right (west) path, entering into the eastbound left turn lane where it contacted V3 head-on (event 3). V2 and V3 came to final rest against each other in eastbound lane three. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.
The driver of V1 is a 60 year-old female who suffered minor injures and was transported from the scene. She had just completed an 8-hour day at work. She left her job, briefly stopped by the post office and intended to cross the street and pick up a card at CVS for her friend. She reported the traffic signal being in flash mode, causing a major backup for westbound traffic. She waited in line for 5-6 minutes before it was her turn to go. She wanted to go straight across the major intersection. Northbound traffic had come to a complete stop, despite having a flashing yellow light. She assumed north/south traffic was treating the flashing yellow as a four-way stop. She creeped her way through the intersection and could see southbound lanes 3,4 and 5 had come to a stop. She assumed lane 1 and 2 would also stop, so even though her vision was blocked, she proceeded straight across. As she passed through the intersection, V2 came up lane 2 at a high rate of speed and struck her right side. Her side curtain airbags deployed causing her to be confused about what happened next. She never saw V2 prior to impact. Her vehicle suffered non-disabling damage and was towed from the scene.
The driver of V2 is a 38 year-old male who suffered minor injuries and was interviewed on-scene. He had the day off work and was returning home from a town about an hour away. He reported driving southbound in lane two at 72 kph (45 mph). He says the traffic signals had malfunctioned and were flashing yellow in his direction. V1 came from the left, with the intention of going straight across the intersection. He applied the brakes and steered right, but he contacted the right, front of V1. He then said the left rear of his car hit the right rear of V1. He continued on a right path and struck V3 head-on. He never saw V3 because his airbag deployed after the first impact. His vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage.
The driver of V3 is a 23 year-old male who was not injured in the crash. He had just completed a construction job on the corner next to the crash site. Him and his five co-workers were en-route back to their office about two hours away. He pulled up to the intersection with the intention of turning left. He soon realized that since the lights were flashing and rush hour traffic was heavy, that he would never be able to safely make a left turn. He put his vehicle in reverse with the intention of backing up and getting in the right turn lane, to turn right and do a U-turn up the road. When he stopped in his travel lane and put the vehicle in drive, he noticed V2 coming straight towards him. He was stopped and unable to make any avoidance maneuvers. No occupants were injured and none of his 1500 lbs of cargo shifted during impact. His vehicle was driven from the scene with minor damage.
