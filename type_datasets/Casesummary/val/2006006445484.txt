The crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on the right (east) roadside of a six-lane physically divided urban roadway. The roadway consisted of three northbound express lanes and three northbound local lanes. The bituminous roadway was straight and level with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). Separating the east sidewalk from the roadway was a grassy area with planted trees. The traffic flow was slowed and the road was wet from a heavy rain that was falling at the time of the crash.
V1, a 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante, was northbound in local lane one (the rightmost travel lane). V1 drifted right and departed the roadway. The undercarriage of V1 struck and knocked off a piece of concrete from the curb as it left the roadway. V1 continued north along the grass strip for 9.4m (30.8 ft.) until the front of V1 struck a large tree. V1 came to final rest less than a meter from the tree on the grass strip. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
The driver of V1, a 39-year old female, reported many injuries, the most serious of which is fracture of the right hip that has left her unable to return to work. The driver stated that she had no explanation for what had happened or how she ended up driving off of the roadway. V1 driver acknowledged that there were a number of extraordinary factors that contributed to the crash. Driver elaborated, saying that she had been late for work because her vehicle was not working and that she had borrowed her sister's vehicle that was in need of a new transmission. Furthermore, driver stated that her mood had been very depressed for some time due to her employment and a terminally ill family member. Driver stated that though she was late for work she was not speeding, citing the fact that V1's transmission was slipping very badly making speeding "impossible". Driver also stated that she was very focused on the terminally ill family member at the time of the crash and that this was causing her a lot of stress. Driver reported to researcher and the attending medical staff that after her vehicle departed the roadway, the next thing that she had been aware of was that she was in an ambulance and was very confused.
