This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection and the front of V1 contacted the left side of Vehicle 2 (V2), causing V2 to rotate and ultimately come to rest on its left side. This indicates a collision where the front of one vehicle collided with the side of another, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
