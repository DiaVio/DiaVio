This is because V1, the 2001 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck, was making a left turn at the intersection and was hit on the right side by V2, the 1996 Dodge Ram pickup truck. The front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which is a characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
