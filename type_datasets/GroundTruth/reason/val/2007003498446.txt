This is because V1, the Mercedes-Benz ML320, swerved into lane two and the left plane of V1 struck the right plane of V2, causing V2 to rotate and roll onto its left side. This collision involves the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
