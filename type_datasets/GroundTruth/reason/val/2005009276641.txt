This is because Vehicle 1, driven by the 30-year-old male, struck the back of Vehicle 2, driven by the 45-year-old female, while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on the highway. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was a recognition error due to inattention, which suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to notice the slowing or stopped Vehicle 2 in front of them.
