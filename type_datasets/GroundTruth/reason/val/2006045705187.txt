This is because the crash involved only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the accident. V1 crossed into the right turn only lane, crossed the side street, and struck the guardrail head-on, resulting in damage to the guardrail and coming to rest on top of the guardrail posts.
