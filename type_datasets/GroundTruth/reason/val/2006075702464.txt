This is because the crash involved only one vehicle (V1) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the accident. The description states that V1 traveled off the left side of the road and struck the jersey barrier, rotated, and then reentered the roadway before coming to rest off the right side of the road. There is no indication of any other vehicles or entities involved in the collision.
