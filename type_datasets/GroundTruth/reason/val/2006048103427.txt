Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was attempting to cross over the westbound lanes and turn left to head east. Vehicle two (V2), which was traveling westbound, struck V1 in the left side. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 fits the definition of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
