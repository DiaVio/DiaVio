Non-Motorized Vehicle or Pedestrian Crash

Justification: The accident involved a non-motorized vehicle (V2 - 1984 Chevrolet Cavalier) that ran out of gas and was stationary in the lane. Another vehicle (V1 - 1998 Cadillac STS) collided with the rear of V2, causing damage and pushing it into the left turn lane. The accident did not involve a single vehicle, backover collision, Rear-End Collision, frontal collision, or front-to-side collision. Therefore, it can be classified as a non-motorized vehicle crash.
