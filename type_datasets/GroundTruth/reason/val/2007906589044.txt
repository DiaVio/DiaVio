This is because Vehicle 1 (Ford Windstar minivan) collided with the front corner of Vehicle 2 (Ford Explorer compact utility vehicle) as it was traveling northbound and Vehicle 2 was traveling westbound through the intersection. The impact occurred between the front of Vehicle 1 and the front corner of Vehicle 2, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision.
