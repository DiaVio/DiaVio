This is because V1 (Ford Contour) was traveling northbound and struck V2 (Dodge Caliber) on its right front as it attempted to turn left. This collision occurred when the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
