Justification: Vehicle one (V1) and vehicle two (V2) were both traveling eastbound on a barrier-divided roadway. V1 was attempting to avoid a large piece of a truck tire in its lane and veered into lane two and then back into lane four, where it collided with the front of V2. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
