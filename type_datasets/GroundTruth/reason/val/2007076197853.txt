This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and no other entities. V1 departed the right road edge, contacted a rock embankment, rolled multiple times, and came to rest across the westbound lanes. There was no mention of any involvement of another vehicle or non-motorized entity in the accident.
