The driver of Vehicle 1 was turning left in the intersection and was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight in the opposite direction. This collision scenario matches the characteristics of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision. The snow bank in the northeast corner of the intersection was an associated factor, but it does not change the type of the collision.
