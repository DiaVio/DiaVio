This is because the accident involves only one vehicle, with no mention of any other entities such as objects, persons, or other vehicles being involved in the collision. The vehicle, a Ford F-150 pickup, exited the roadway, struck the jersey barrier, and rolled over, resulting in a single-vehicle crash.
