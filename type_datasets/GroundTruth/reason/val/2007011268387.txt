This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) being involved in the collision. The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, causing the vehicle to leave the road, resulting in multiple impacts with various objects (guardrail, road sign, tree stump, tree) before coming to rest.
