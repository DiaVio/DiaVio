This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (the 1996 Ford Ranger) and there is no involvement of any other entities. The driver reported a transmission failure which caused the wheels to lock up, resulting in the vehicle veering off the right side of the highway and into a guardrail, ultimately rolling over.
