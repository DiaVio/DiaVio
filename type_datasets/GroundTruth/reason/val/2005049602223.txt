Justification: The accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and no other entities. Vehicle 1 avoided a possible collision with another vehicle by steering to the right, but ended up driving off the roadway and impacting a traffic light pole. The other vehicle involved was released as a non-contact vehicle.
