This is because Vehicle 1 (Honda Accord) was stopped and waiting to turn left when it was struck on the left side by Vehicle 2 (Ford Taurus) traveling in the northbound lane. The impact occurred between the front of Vehicle 2 and the left side of Vehicle 1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
