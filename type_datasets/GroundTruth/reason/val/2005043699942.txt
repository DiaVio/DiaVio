This is because Vehicle 1 (1992 Toyota Cressida) struck the right side of Vehicle 2 (2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac pickup) as Vehicle 2 was turning left across traffic. The impact occurred between the front of Vehicle 1 and the side of Vehicle 2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
