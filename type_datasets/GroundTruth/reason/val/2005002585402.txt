This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle #1) and there is no mention of any other entities being involved in the collision. Vehicle #1 drove off the right side of the roadway and struck a telephone pole guide wire anchor, resulting in damage to the vehicle and minor injuries to the driver.
