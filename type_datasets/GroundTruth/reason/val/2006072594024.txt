This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there is no mention of any other entities such as objects, persons, or other vehicles being involved in the collision. Vehicle 1 ran off the left side of the roadway and struck the concrete median barrier, ultimately coming to rest across lane two.
