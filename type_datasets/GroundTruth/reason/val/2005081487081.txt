This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) collided with the side of Vehicle 3 (V3) after veering across three lanes. The impact of V1 with V3 then caused a chain reaction, pushing V3 into the rear of Vehicle 4 (V4) and Vehicle 5 (V5), which were in the adjacent lane. The collision between the front of V1 and the side of V3 is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
