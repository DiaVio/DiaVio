This is because the accident only involves one vehicle, the 1994 Chevrolet Lumina sedan (V1), and there is no mention of any other entities being involved in the collision. The driver of V1 lost his brakes, swerved to avoid hitting another vehicle, and drove off the roadway, ultimately impacting two parked vans.
