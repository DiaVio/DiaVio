This is because V1, the Plymouth Voyager, made a U-turn into the southbound lanes and was struck by V2, the Lincoln LS, on the right rear corner. This collision involved the front of V2 colliding with the side of V1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
