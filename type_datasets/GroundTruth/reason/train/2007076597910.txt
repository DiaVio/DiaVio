This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and there were no other entities involved in the collision. V1 exited the road, rode up a sloping embankment, and then impacted a drainage stem wall, ultimately coming to rest on its right side. There were no indications of involvement of any other vehicle or entity in the accident.
