This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. Vehicle 1 drove off the road and struck a pole, resulting in damage and minor injuries to the driver. The primary cause of the accident was determined to be the driver's excessive speed for the curve, along with factors such as inexperience and distraction.
