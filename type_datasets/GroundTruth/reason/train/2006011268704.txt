V1, the Sonoma pickup truck, was exiting the commercial drive and turning left to go westbound on the roadway. V2, the Saturn, was traveling eastbound in lane one of the roadway when it collided with the left side of V1. This type of collision is commonly referred to as a "T-bone" collision, where the front of one vehicle collides with the side of another.
