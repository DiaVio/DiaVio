This is because V1 (Nissan Quest minivan) struck the rear of V2 (transit bus) while V2 was stopped in the first lane of travel to let off passengers. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by ending a phone call and looking down to hang up the phone, which resulted in him not being able to stop in time and sliding into the rear of V2.
