This is because Vehicle 1, driven by an 84-year-old male, made an illegal left turn across three lanes of traffic and was struck by Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight in lane three. The front of Vehicle 2 collided with the side of Vehicle 1, resulting in both vehicles coming to a rest in the middle of the intersection.
