Justification: 
- Vehicle 1 (V1) struck the right side of Vehicle 2 (V2) in the intersection, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another.
- The description of the collision, with V1 rotating clockwise and V2 rotating clockwise after being struck by V1, is consistent with a front-to-side collision.
- The fact that V2's left side was struck by the front of V3 also suggests a front-to-side collision.
