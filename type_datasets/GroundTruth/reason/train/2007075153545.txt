This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities were mentioned in the description. V1 rotated clockwise and struck the jersey barrier, resulting in the vehicle rolling over. The driver of V1 stated that he lost control after tapping the brakes due to traffic on the main lanes and the critical reason for the accident was determined to be traveling too fast for conditions (slush-covered roadway).
