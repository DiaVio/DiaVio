This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. The driver lost control of the vehicle after successfully avoiding hitting a deer on the wet road, leading to the vehicle swerving off the right side of the roadway and colliding with a guide rail before rolling over onto its roof.
