This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1), with no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. The vehicle crossed the double yellow line, struck a guardrail, utility pole, small tree, and ultimately came to rest in a driveway, indicating that it was the only vehicle involved in the collision.
