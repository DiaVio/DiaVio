This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) attempted to pass Vehicle 2 (V2) and struck the left back and left rear tire of V2's trailer. The front of V1 then continued to strike and tear off the left front tire of V2. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, resulting in a front-to-side collision.
