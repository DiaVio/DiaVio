V1, the BMW Z-4, was making a left turn at the intersection while V2, the Pontiac Montana minivan, was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking but was unsuccessful and struck the side of V1. This collision involves the front of V2 colliding with the side of V1, which fits the definition of a Front-to-Side Collision.
