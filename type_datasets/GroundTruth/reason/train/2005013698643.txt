The accident involved V1, a 1996 Chevy Monte Carlo, pulling out of a private drive and being struck by V2, a 1994 Ford Escort, in the second lane. V1 was turning left, and V2 was traveling in the right curb lane. The point of contact was the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, forming a "T-bone" collision. 

This classification is supported by the description of the critical pre-crash events for both vehicles, with V1 traveling (turning left) and V2 experiencing other vehicle encroachment from the driveway street, turning into the opposite direction.
