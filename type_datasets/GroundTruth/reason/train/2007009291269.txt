This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to hydroplaning on the wet road, resulting in the vehicle spinning, hitting the guardrail, and ultimately flipping onto its roof.
