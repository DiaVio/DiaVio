Justification:
- Vehicle 1 (V1) was northbound and Vehicle 2 (V2) was southbound.
- V1 steered left to avoid a non-contact vehicle and the front of V1 struck the front of V2.
- V2 rotated counterclockwise and the right side struck a pole off the west side of the road.
- This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
