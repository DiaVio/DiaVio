Vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck on the right side by the front of Vehicle two (V2). V1 rotated counterclockwise and was struck on the right side by the left side of V2. V2 came to rest facing north in the northbound lanes north of the intersection. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which aligns with a Front-to-Side Collision.
