This is because Vehicle 2 (1997 Buick Lasabre) traveling south struck Vehicle 1 (1987 Chevy Pick-up truck) on its right side as Vehicle 1 was turning left at the intersection. The collision occurred between the front of Vehicle 2 and the side of Vehicle 1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
