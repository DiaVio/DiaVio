Justification: The accident occurred at a 4-way intersection where one vehicle (V1) traveling northbound collided with another vehicle (V2) traveling westbound. V1's front contacted V2 in the left side. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or T-bone collision.
