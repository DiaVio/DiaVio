Justification: The accident occurred at a four-way intersection, where Vehicle 1 was attempting to make a left turn and was impacted on the right side by Vehicle 2 with its front plane. This aligns with the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
