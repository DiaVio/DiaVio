This is because V1, the Buick Lacrosse, was attempting to make a right-hand turn at the intersection and V2, the Ford dump truck, was passing through the intersection. The front of V2 contacted the back of V1, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1).
