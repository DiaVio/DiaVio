This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1), with no other entities involved. The description indicates that V1 spun clockwise and left the road, ultimately colliding with a tree. The presence of alcohol and cocaine in the driver's system, along with other contributing factors such as speeding and low tire tread, suggest that the driver's actions and impairment were the primary causes of the accident.
