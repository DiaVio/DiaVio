This is because V1, the Nissan Sentra, was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and V2, the Mercury Grand Marquis, attempted to make a left turn in front of V1. The collision occurred between the front of V1 and the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
