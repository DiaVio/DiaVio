This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection without stopping for the traffic control device and was impacted on the left plane near the rear axle by Vehicle 2 (V2), which was traveling northbound. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and resulted in a collision with the rear bumper corner of Vehicle 3 (V3). This sequence of events indicates a front-to-side collision between V1 and V2.
