Single-Vehicle Accident.

Justification:
- The accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved.
- V1 departs the right side of the road, blows two right tires on the curb, and continues parallel to the road, ultimately striking a sign and coming to rest in a grassy area.
- There is no mention of any collision with another vehicle or non-motorized entity.
- The driver of V1 was distracted, fatigued, and failed to see the curve, indicating that the accident was caused by the actions or conditions within the vehicle itself.
