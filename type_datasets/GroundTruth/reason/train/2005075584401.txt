This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) that sideswiped a parked vehicle (V2), then continued off the road and collided with two more parked vehicles (V3 and V4), as well as other objects (fence, trailer, lawn tractor). There was no involvement of any other vehicles or entities in the accident.
