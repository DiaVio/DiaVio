This classification is chosen because the accident does not fit into any of the specific types mentioned in the description. It does not involve a single vehicle accident, backover collision, Rear-End Collision, frontal collision, front-to-side collision, or non-motorized vehicle or pedestrian crash. It is a unique case where the driver experienced a critical non-performance error, possibly due to a heart attack or other physical impairment, leading to the vehicle going off the road and colliding with a signpost and a light pole.
