Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was making a left turn at the intersection and collided with the front of vehicle two (V2) as it was crossing the intersection. This type of collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision, involves the front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, which is consistent with the description of the accident in the case summary.
