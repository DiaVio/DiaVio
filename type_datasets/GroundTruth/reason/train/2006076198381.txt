This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one) and there was no mention of any other entities such as another vehicle, object, or pedestrian involved in the crash. The driver of Vehicle one lost control of the vehicle and it departed the road to the left, ultimately coming to rest in the median.
