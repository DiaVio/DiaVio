This is because V1 (Mitsubishi Mirage) was traveling south and attempted to turn left into the driveway when it was struck on the right side by V2 (Ford Ranger) traveling north in lane one. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 corresponds to a front-to-side collision or commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
