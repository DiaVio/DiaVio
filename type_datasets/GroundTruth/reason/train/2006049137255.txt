This is because Vehicle one (V1) was traveling straight (pre-event movement coded as "going straight") and Vehicle two (V2) was turning left at the intersection (pre-event movement coded as "stopped in traffic lane" and critical pre-crash event coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection"). The collision occurred when the front of V2 struck the front of V1 and then the right side of V2 struck the left side of V1.
