This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (1996 Toyota Camry) and no other entities were involved. The vehicle traveled off the right side of the road, struck a culvert, rotated, and then struck a mailbox post before rolling over. The driver was ejected and unfortunately died as a result of the crash.
