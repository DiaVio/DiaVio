This is because the front of Vehicle 2 (V2) collided with the side of Vehicle 1 (V1) as V1 was turning left at the intersection and V2 steered to the right into the adjacent lane. The collision occurred in the number one eastbound lane, with V1 coming to rest facing the southeast corner of the intersection and V2 facing southbound on the southern crosswalk.
