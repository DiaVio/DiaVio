This is because Vehicle #1, the Hyundai XG350, was heading westbound and failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign, resulting in a collision with Vehicle #2, the Toyota Camry, which was traveling southbound. The impact occurred at the front of Vehicle #2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
