This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) crossed all lanes of travel and collided with the center median wall, then rotated clockwise and crossed all four lanes of travel to contact the guardrail on the right side of the interstate. Additionally, V1 was later pushed from final rest to the center median lane where it contacted a van. This sequence of events indicates a collision between the front of V1 and the side of another vehicle (the van).
