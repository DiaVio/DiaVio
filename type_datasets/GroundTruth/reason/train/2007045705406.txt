This is because V1, the Ford Ranger pickup truck, was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and was struck on the right side by V2, the Honda Accord, which was traveling through the same intersection. The impact occurred between the front of V2 and the side of V1, resulting in a "T-bone" collision.
