This is because V1 (the 2003 Oldsmobile Alero) collided with the back right portion of V2 (the 1995 Volvo 850) with the front left portion of V1. The force of the crash lifted the rear of V2 on top of the left front corner of V1, causing V2 to veer off to the left. This collision occurred when V1 veered right from lane four into lane three in an attempt to reach the witness's vehicle in lane one.
