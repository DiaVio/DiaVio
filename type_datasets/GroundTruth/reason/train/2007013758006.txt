This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. V1 lost control on a curved roadway, departed the roadway, and impacted a tree. The driver stated that the vehicle started to hydroplane, indicating that the accident was caused by the vehicle's behavior and not due to any collision with another vehicle or object.
