This is because Vehicle #1 (1998 Toyota Corolla) switched lanes to avoid slowing down and struck the left rear of Vehicle #3 (1996 Chevrolet Blazer) with its right front. This impact caused Vehicle #2 (2004 Nissan Frontier pickup) to be struck in the rear by Vehicle #1 and resulted in a counterclockwise rotation and subsequent collision with Vehicle #3.
