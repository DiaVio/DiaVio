This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (2001 Toyota Camry Solara) and there is no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) being involved in the crash. The vehicle traveled off the right side of the roadway, reentered, crossed the center line, and then traveled off the left side of the roadway, ultimately striking the embankment.
