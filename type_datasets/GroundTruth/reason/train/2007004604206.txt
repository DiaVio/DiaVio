Justification: V2, the Honda Civic, was traveling north in lane one and proceeded into the intersection when the signal turned green. V1, the Chevrolet Avalanche, was traveling west in lane two and struck V2 on the right side. The impact caused V2 to spin counter-clockwise and mount the center median, resulting in a collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2. This collision is commonly known as a "T-bone" collision, which is a type of front-to-side collision.
