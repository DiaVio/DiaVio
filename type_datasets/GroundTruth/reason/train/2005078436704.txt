This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (2001 Ford Windstar minivan) and no other entities were mentioned. The vehicle ran off the right side of the roadway, hitting a sign, a barbed wire fence, and two dirt mounds before coming to rest. There is no mention of another vehicle involved in the collision.
