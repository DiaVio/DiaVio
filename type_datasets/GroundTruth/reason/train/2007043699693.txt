This is because the crash involved two motorized vehicles, the International 4300 truck and the Honda Accord sedan. Both vehicles were in motion on the roadway when the noncontact vehicle (the truck) crossed the center line and entered the lane of the Honda Accord, causing the driver of the Honda to steer off the road to avoid a head-on collision.
