This is because V1 (2000 Dodge Grand Caravan minivan) struck V2 (2004 Honda Accord sedan) on the right side of V2's vehicle as V2 crossed the intersection. The point of impact and the final rest positions of both vehicles indicate a collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
