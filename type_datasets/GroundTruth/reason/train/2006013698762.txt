This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1, a 1999 Ford Explorer) and there is no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) being involved in the collision. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to a malfunction in the four-wheel drive system, causing the vehicle to fishtail and eventually roll off the roadway.
