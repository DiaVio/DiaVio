This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. The vehicle departed the road, struck a garbage can, reentered the road, and then departed again, ultimately striking a fire hydrant where it came to rest. The driver reported a possible diabetic seizure and a blackout, indicating that there was no involvement of another vehicle or entity in the collision.
