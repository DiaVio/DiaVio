This is because V1 (1998 Pontiac Grand Am) was turning left at the intersection and was struck on the left side by the front of V2 (1999 Ford Escort LX), which was traveling straight ahead. The point of impact was on the left side of V1, indicating a collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision.
