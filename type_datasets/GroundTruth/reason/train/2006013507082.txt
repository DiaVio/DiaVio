This is because V1, while attempting to transfer from westbound to southbound, entered the intersection under a red light and made contact with two vehicles (V2 and V3) approaching in the eastbound direction of travel. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V3, causing V1 to spin and contact the left side of V2.
