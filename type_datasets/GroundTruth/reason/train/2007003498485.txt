Justification: The accident occurred at a signalized intersection where V2 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, and V1, traveling westbound, impacted the right side of V2. This scenario represents a front of one vehicle (V1) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
