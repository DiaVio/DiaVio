This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) struck the back of Vehicle 2 (V2) while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction, with V1 hitting the back of V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane - other vehicle stopped," while the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane - traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This indicates that V1 collided with the rear of V2, confirming it as a Rear-End Collision.
