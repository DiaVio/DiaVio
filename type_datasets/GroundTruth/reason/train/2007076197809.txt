This is because Vehicle 1 was exiting a business drive and began to turn left, and then impacted with the right front end of Vehicle 2, which was traveling east in the #2 lane. The impact occurred when Vehicle 1 pulled out in front of Vehicle 2, resulting in a collision between the front of Vehicle 2 and the side of Vehicle 1, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
