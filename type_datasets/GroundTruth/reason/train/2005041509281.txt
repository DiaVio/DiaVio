This is because V1, the Dodge Ram, was changing lanes and lost control, resulting in the right rear corner of V1 making contact with the left side of V2, the Mercedes Benz. V1 then rotated across the northbound lanes and the front of V1 made contact with the barrier wall. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V1) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V2).
