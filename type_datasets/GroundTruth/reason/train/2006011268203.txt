This is because V1, which was traveling westbound, was making a left turn into a driveway when it was struck on its front right corner by V2, which was traveling eastbound. The point of impact indicates that the front of one vehicle (V2) collided with the side of another vehicle (V1), resulting in a "T-bone" collision.
