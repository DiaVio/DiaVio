This is because V1, the Toyota Avalon, traveled over the double yellow line into oncoming traffic and struck the left front of V2, the Buick Le Sabre. Then, V1 struck the left front of V3, the Dodge Caravan, scraping down the side toward the left front door. This sequence of events corresponds to a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, which is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision.
