This is because the accident only involves one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities being involved. V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, struck a curb, utility pole, and a sign, and then continued off the right side of the road again. The accident was caused by the driver's excessive speed for the curve, his inexperience, and the vehicle defect of mismatched tires/wheels.
