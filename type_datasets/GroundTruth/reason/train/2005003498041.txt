This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle #1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. The vehicle traveled off the edge of the road, contacted the raised curb, blew a tire, and then contacted the guardrail, resulting in the vehicle coming to a rest on the right lane.
