This is because V1 (BMW 318i) swerved into the northern parking lane and impacted the left side of V2 (Nissan Altima), which was legally parked in the parking lane. Subsequently, V1's front impacted the back of V3 (Dodge B-Series Cargo Van), which was also legally parked in the parking lane. This sequence of events indicates that V1 collided with the vehicles in front of it, which aligns with the characteristics of a Rear-End Collision.
