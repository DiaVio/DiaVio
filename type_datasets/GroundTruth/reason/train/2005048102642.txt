This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection and its front plane struck the right plane of Vehicle 2 (V2). Then, V1's front left plane struck the left plane of Vehicle 3 (V3). This indicates that the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2), resulting in a "T-bone" collision.
