Justification: V1, the pickup truck, entered the intersection without the right of way and its front struck the right side of V2, the SUV. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or "T-bone" collision.
