Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was traveling straight in the number five lane, while vehicle two (V2) changed lanes to the left and contacted the right side of V1. The impact caused V1 to roll onto its right side and come to rest facing west across the number six lane. This describes a front-to-side collision, where the front of V1 collided with the side of V2.
