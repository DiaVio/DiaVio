This is because Vehicle 1 (V1), the 1993 GMC Sierra pickup, struck the back of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1999 GMC Yukon, while both vehicles were traveling in the same lane. The physical evidence, including the application of brakes by V1 and V2 making a sudden stop, supports the conclusion that V1 collided with the rear of V2.
