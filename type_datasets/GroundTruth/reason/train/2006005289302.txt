This is because V1, the 2002 Freightliner Fire truck, struck the left side of V2, the 2005 Ford Explorer Police vehicle, as they entered the intersection. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise approximately 45 degrees before coming to a rest in the northbound lane. This collision involves the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which fits the definition of a front-to-side collision.
