This is because V1, the Pontiac Grand Am, was pulling out of a commercial drive on the north side of the road and attempted to turn left into the lane where V2, the Chevrolet Impala, was traveling. V2 saw V1 turning into his lane and tried to avoid the collision by steering right. However, the front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. This collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another is characteristic of a Front-to-Side collision.
