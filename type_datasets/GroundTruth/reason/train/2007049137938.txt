The accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. The driver of V1 traveled off the road and struck a small post and then the median jersey barrier. The cause of the crash was a driver-related factor, specifically an internal distraction (choking on hot coffee).
