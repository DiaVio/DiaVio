This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (2006 Dodge Stratus) and no other entities were mentioned to be involved in the collision. The vehicle skidded, departed the roadway, and rolled before coming to rest. The driver's internal distraction and fatigue were stated as critical reasons for the accident.
