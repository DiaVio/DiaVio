Justification: The accident involved only one vehicle, the 2003 Mazda Protégé sedan, and no other entities were mentioned. The driver of the vehicle lost control and drove off the road, eventually crashing into a sewer grate and coming to a rest. The driver's impaired state, as indicated by failing the alcohol test and the presence of marijuana residue, likely contributed to the accident.
