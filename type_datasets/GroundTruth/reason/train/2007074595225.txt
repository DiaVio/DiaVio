Justification: The accident occurred in a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection where Vehicle 1 (V1) was turning left and the front of V1 struck the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). This aligns with the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or T-bone collision.
