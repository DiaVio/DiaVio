This is because the accident only involves one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, crossed over multiple sidewalks, struck several objects (stop sign, fire hydrant, fences), and eventually collided with a tree.
