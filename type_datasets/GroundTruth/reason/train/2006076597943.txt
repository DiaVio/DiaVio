Justification: The accident involved vehicle one (1983 Mercedes 240D) inching out into the intersection and the front plane of vehicle one impacting the right side of vehicle two (2006 Chevrolet Cobalt). This scenario matches the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
