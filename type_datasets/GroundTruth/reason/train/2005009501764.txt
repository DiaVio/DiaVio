Justification: V1, a 2005 Dodge Caravan, was stopped for a red signal preparing to turn right from the driveway exit. As V1 turned right on the red signal and attempted to enter lane two, it was struck by V2, a 2000 Ford Expedition. V2 rotated approximately 30 degrees counterclockwise, crossing the centerline and contacting V3, a 2000 Saturn SL2, in a front-to-side collision.
