Justification: 
- Vehicle one (1985 Chevrolet C-10 pickup) was southbound in the first lane, while Vehicle two (2000 Honda Accord) was northbound in the third lane (left turn lane). 
- Vehicle two turned left at the intersection, and the front of vehicle one impacted the right side of vehicle two. 
- This is consistent with a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
