Justification: The front of V1 (Volkswagen Jetta) struck the right side of V2 (Dodge minivan), resulting in a collision between the front of V2 and the front of V3 (Buick Regal). This aligns with the definition of a Front-to-Side Collision, where the front of one vehicle collides with the side of another ("T-bone" collision).
