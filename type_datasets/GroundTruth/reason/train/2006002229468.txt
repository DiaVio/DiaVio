This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle #1) and there was no mention of any other entities or vehicles being involved in the crash. The driver of Vehicle #1 encountered a deer on the roadway, lost control of the vehicle, and collided with the guardrail, sign, tree stump, and log, ultimately coming to a rest.
