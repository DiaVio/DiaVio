This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and no other entities. V1 swerved between lanes, entered the median, struck a light pole, rotated, and came to rest on its top in the southbound lane. The cause of the accident was determined to be a driver-related factor, specifically a diabetic episode or physical impairment.
