This is because V1, the Honda Prelude, entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck on the right side by the front of V2, the Toyota Celica. The collision occurred when the front of one vehicle (V2) collided with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a "T-bone" collision.
