This is because Vehicle 1 (V1), the white Chevrolet Astro minivan, was northbound and intending to turn left, while Vehicle 2 (V2), the gray Buick Regal sedan, was westbound and proceeded into the path of V1 while executing a left turn. This resulted in the front of V1 colliding with the left side of V2.
