The accident occurred when V1, traveling eastbound, collided with V2, traveling northbound. V1 struck the side of V2, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and eventually rollover. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 corresponds to a front-to-side collision or commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
