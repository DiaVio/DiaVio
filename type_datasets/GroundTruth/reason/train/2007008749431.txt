This is because V2 (Honda Civic) traveling northbound in lane one collided with the front right of V1 (Lexus RX 300) that was traveling eastbound and had passed through the intersection without stopping for the stop sign. The impact occurred between the front left of V2 and the right front of V1, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision.
