Justification:
- Vehicle 1 (1999 International 9200 tractor pulling one trailer) was traveling downhill and its brakes failed.
- Vehicle 2 (Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility) was stopped at the intersection in lane one.
- Vehicle 3 (2005 Pontiac Sunfire coupe) was stopped at the intersection in lane two.
- Vehicle 1 attempted to steer between vehicles 2 and 3, resulting in a collision.
- The right front side of Vehicle 1 contacted the left rear side of Vehicle 2, and the left front side of Vehicle 1 contacted the right side of Vehicle 3.

This description matches the characteristics of a front-to-side collision as the front of one vehicle (Vehicle 1) collides with the side of another vehicle (Vehicles 2 and 3), also known as a "T-bone" collision.
