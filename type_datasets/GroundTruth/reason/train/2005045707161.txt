The accident involved Vehicle #1, a Pontiac Sunfire, which was traveling south on the rural road and attempted to turn left (east) on the residential roadway. However, the driver did not complete the left turn and went over the right (south) curb of the residential street, heading southeast, and struck the decorative brick wall with the front right corner of the vehicle. This collision between the front of Vehicle #1 and the side of the decorative brick wall corresponds to a front-to-side collision.
