This is because V1, the Mazda MX-6 coupe, was initially traveling north on the road and then attempted to turn around on her front yard on the east side of the road. When re-entering the road to head south, V1 was in the northbound lane and collided with V2, the Dodge Neon, which was traveling north. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in a front-to-side collision.
