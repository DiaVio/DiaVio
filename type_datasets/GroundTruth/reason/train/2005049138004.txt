Justification:
- Vehicle 1 (V1) was stopped at a stop sign and entered the intersection without the right of way.
- Vehicle 2 (V2) was approaching the intersection and its right side was impacted by the front of V1.
- The vehicles rotated in opposite directions after the collision and came to rest facing northwest.
- The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a vehicle traveling and turning left at the intersection.
- The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as V1's encroachment by turning into the opposite direction.
- A witness statement confirms that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. 

All these factors indicate that it was a Front-to-Side Collision.
