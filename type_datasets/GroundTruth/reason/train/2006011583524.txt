This is because V1, the 1999 Toyota Corolla, was the only vehicle involved in the initial crash. It lost control while negotiating a curve, hit a cement barrier, and then rebounded back into the lane perpendicular to the flow of traffic. The subsequent collision with V2 was a result of V1's initial single-vehicle accident.
