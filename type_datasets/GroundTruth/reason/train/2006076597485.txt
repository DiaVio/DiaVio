Justification: The accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and there were no mentions of other entities involved in the crash. V1 drifted off the edge of the road, impacted a rock embankment, rolled multiple times, and eventually came to rest on its roof in the eastbound lane. The accident was caused by the driver falling asleep, indicating that it was a single-vehicle event.
