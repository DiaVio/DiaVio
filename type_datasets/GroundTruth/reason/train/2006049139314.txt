Vehicle one (V 1) crossed the travel lanes on the exit ramp and was struck on the right side by the front of Vehicle two (V 2). V 1 then rotated counterclockwise and was struck on the right side by the left side of V 2. This sequence of events indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
