This is because Vehicle 1 (Dodge Caravan) struck the right side of Vehicle 2 (Chevrolet Trailblazer) with its front, causing Vehicle 2 to be sideswiped and come to a final rest. The impact occurred at an intersection where the vehicles were traveling in straight paths, resulting in a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of the other.
