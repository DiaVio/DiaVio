Backover Collision - Vehicle reverses into an object, person, or another vehicle.
Justification: The accident involved a single vehicle (V1) that lost control and drove up on the left side concrete barrier wall, causing debris to fly into the northbound lanes of traffic. V1 then rolled and skidded to final rest in lane three. The driver stated that his car drove up the concrete median and landed upside down in the middle lane. This indicates that V1 reversed into the concrete median wall, resulting in the accident.
