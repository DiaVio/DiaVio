This is because Vehicle 1 (2002 Chevrolet S10 pickup truck) rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then rolled left, causing the top of the vehicle to make contact with the back of Vehicle 2 (2004 GMC Yukon XL 1500 sport utility). This collision occurred when the front of Vehicle 1 collided with the side of Vehicle 2.
