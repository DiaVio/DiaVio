This is because the accident involved only one vehicle, the 2005 Honda Pilot, and there was no mention of any other entities, such as another vehicle, object, or pedestrian, being involved in the collision. The driver of the Honda Pilot lost control of the vehicle and struck the cement barrier on the north side of the highway, resulting in damages to the vehicle.
