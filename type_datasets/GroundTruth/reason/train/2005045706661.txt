Vehicle 1, the 2002 Ford Taurus, was in the left turn lane on the westbound side of the arterial road and was turning left across eastbound traffic when it was impacted on the right side by Vehicle 2, the 2000 Oldsmobile Alero. This indicates that the front of Vehicle 1 collided with the side of Vehicle 2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
