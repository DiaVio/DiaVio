This is because Vehicle #2 (1996 Ford Explorer) struck the right side of Vehicle #1 (1998 Ford Taurus) as it attempted to cross from the private drive on the south side of the road to the private drive on the north side. Additionally, there was a minor secondary side slap impact between the two vehicles.
