This is because the accident only involves one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities such as pedestrians or other vehicles being involved in the collision. V1 departed the roadway, struck a utility pole, re-entered the roadway, and then struck a parked and unoccupied vehicle. The driver of V1 then attempted to flee the scene on foot.
