Justification: Vehicle one was attempting to turn left and go westbound, while vehicle two was traveling westbound. The impact occurred when vehicle two collided with the right plane of vehicle one. This aligns with the definition of a front-to-side collision, where the front of one vehicle collides with the side of another ("T-bone" collision).
