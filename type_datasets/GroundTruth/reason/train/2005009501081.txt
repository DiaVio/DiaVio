The description states that V1 (Toyota Camry) was traveling east and V2 (Honda Accord) was traveling north, and they made contact in the intersection. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which is a classic example of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
