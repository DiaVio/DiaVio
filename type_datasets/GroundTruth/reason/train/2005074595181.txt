Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was traveling east in the second lane and made a left turn without slowing or stopping. Vehicle two (V2) was traveling west in the first lane and was struck by the front of V1. This scenario describes a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
