The accident involves a single vehicle (V-1) driven by a male with three passengers. The vehicle was making a left turn at an intersection when it ran off the road and struck a power pole. The driver's medical condition (Epilepsy) and subsequent seizure during the left turn indicate a driver-related factor and impairment of the ability to act, leading to the crash.
