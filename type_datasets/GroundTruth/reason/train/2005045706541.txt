Justification: Vehicle 1 entered the intersection from the east and collided with the right side of Vehicle 2, which was northbound. This collision occurred when Vehicle 2 was passing through the intersection on a solid green light. The impact caused Vehicle 1 to be dragged about twenty meters north and left facing northwest in the right northbound lane. This scenario matches the description of a front-to-side collision, where the front of one vehicle collides with the side of another ("T-bone" collision).
