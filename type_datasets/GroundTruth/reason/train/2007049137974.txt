This is because Vehicle 2 (V2) struck the back of Vehicle 1 (V1) while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction. The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the surroundings and did not detect V2 before the impact. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as another motor vehicle in the same lane traveling at a higher speed, further indicating a Rear-End Collision.
