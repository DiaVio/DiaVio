The accident involved Vehicle 1 (a Dodge Durango) striking the rear of Vehicle 2 (an International straight truck) while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "other vehicle in lane stopped" and the critical reason for the event was "driver inattention." The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This aligns with the characteristics of a Rear-End Collision where one vehicle hits the back of another.
