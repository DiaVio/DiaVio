Justification: Vehicle one (1993 Ford Probe) made contact with vehicle two (unknown Heavy/Medium truck) while trying to avoid a collision with another vehicle in front of it. This indicates that the front of vehicle one collided with the side of vehicle two, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or "T-bone" collision.
