This classification is justified by the fact that Vehicle 1 (V1) was exiting a private drive and intending to turn left, while Vehicle 2 (V2) was westbound and intending to go straight. As V1 entered the highway, the front of V1 struck the right side of V2, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V2).
