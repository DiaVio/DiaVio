This is because Vehicle 1 (Saturn Vue) collided with the side of Vehicle 2 (Ford F150) as Vehicle 2 was proceeding straight through the intersection while Vehicle 1 was making a left turn. Vehicle 2 then continued traveling and impacted the left side of Vehicle 3 (Ford Focus). Therefore, the front of one vehicle (Vehicle 1) collided with the side of another (Vehicle 2), resulting in a T-bone collision.
