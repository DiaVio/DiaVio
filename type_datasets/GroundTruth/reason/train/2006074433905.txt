Justification: Vehicle two (V2), the Mitsubishi Eclipse, entered the intersection and was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle one (V1), the Lincoln Town Car. This indicates that the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
