This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) being involved in the collision. V1 left the roadway, struck a tree stump, and came to rest in a drainage basin, indicating that the accident was a result of the driver's actions and not a collision with another vehicle or object.
