This is because Vehicle #1 (1994 Infiniti J30) was traveling north on the side street and was struck in the right side by the front of Vehicle #2 (1993 Ford Ranger pickup), which was westbound on the urban collector. The impact occurred when the front of one vehicle (Vehicle #2) collided with the side of the other vehicle (Vehicle #1), resembling a "T-bone" collision.
