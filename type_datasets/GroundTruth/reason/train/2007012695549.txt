V1, the Chevrolet Impala, spun clockwise and crossed the path of V2, the Mack garbage truck, causing the front of V2 to contact the right back of V1. Additionally, V3, the Chevrolet Silverado, contacted the front of V1. This indicates that the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2) and then subsequently with the front of another vehicle (V3), resembling a "T-bone" collision.
