Justification: The accident involved two vehicles at a traffic signal-controlled intersection. Vehicle 1, which was never identified, entered the intersection turning left and was struck on its right side by the front of Vehicle 2. This scenario describes a front of one vehicle (V2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a T-bone collision.
