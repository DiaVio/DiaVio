This is because V1, which was stopped at a stop sign and traveling westbound, was struck on the right side by V2, which was traveling southbound. V1 and V2 made contact a second time, creating a side-slap hit, before V1 was pushed through the intersection and contacted V3, which was stopped at a stop sign facing eastbound.
