- V1, the Chevrolet Malibu, swerved to avoid a non-contact vehicle in front of it, resulting in the front of V1 colliding with the guardrail and then entering the westbound roadway.
- V2, the Pontiac Aztec, swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid V1 but the front of V2 still struck the left side of V1.
- V3, the Dodge Ram van, also braked and swerved to avoid V1 but was sideswiped by V1 as it was spinning after being struck by V2.

This sequence of events indicates that the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2), resulting in a Front-to-Side Collision.
