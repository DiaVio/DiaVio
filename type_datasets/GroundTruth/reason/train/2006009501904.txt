Justification: Vehicle V1, a Honda Accord, departed its lane to the left and entered another lane before entering the intersection. It then continued through the intersection and struck the newly formed curb on the south edge of the roadway. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of another vehicle, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision or "T-bone" collision.
