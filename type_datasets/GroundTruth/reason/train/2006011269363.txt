Justification: V1, the 2000 Ford Taurus, was exiting a commercial drive and attempting to turn left onto the roadway. V2, the 2004 Honda Pilot, was eastbound in the through lane and collided with the left side of V1. This collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1 is a typical scenario for a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
