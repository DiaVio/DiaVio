The accident involved only one vehicle, with no other entities involved. The driver of the vehicle suffered a seizure, causing the vehicle to drift and collide with the concrete barrier. The accident occurred on a two-lane divided highway that was under construction, which could be considered a contributing factor. However, since there was no collision with another vehicle or object other than the concrete barrier, it falls under the category of a single-vehicle accident.
