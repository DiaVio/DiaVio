This is because Vehicle #1 (1993 Mercury Cougar) attempted to cross all five lanes of the highway and struck Vehicle #2 (1994 Chevrolet Cavalier) on the left side with its front. Vehicle #1 then rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing northeast, while Vehicle #2 ran partially over the right curb and came to rest also facing northeast just a few meters north of impact.
