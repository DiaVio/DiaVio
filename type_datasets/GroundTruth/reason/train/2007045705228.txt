This is because V1 (the Mack tractor pulling a fuel tanker trailer) swung wide to its left, entering lane two and then coming back into lane one, causing the right side of its trailer to contact the left side of V2 (the 2007 Saturn Ion3). V2 was passing V1 on the right (blind side) when the collision occurred.
