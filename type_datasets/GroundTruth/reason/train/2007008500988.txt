Justification: V1 was intending to turn left into the westbound lanes, while V2 was traveling eastbound in lane one. V1 pulled out from the stop sign in front of V2, resulting in the front of V2 striking the left side of V1. This indicates a collision where the front of one vehicle (V2) collides with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
