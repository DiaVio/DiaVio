Justification: V1, a Nissan pickup, was turning left from the subdivision onto the secondary road when it was struck on the left side by the front of V2, a Jeep Grand Cherokee. This indicates that the front of V2 collided with the side of V1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
