This is because V1, the Chevrolet Malibu, was stopped facing north at a stop sign and intended to turn left, while V2, the Ford Escort, was eastbound and intended to go straight. As V1 turned left, its front contacted V2's front right corner, resulting in a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another (V2).
