This is because vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection and the front of vehicle two (V2) struck the right side of V1. The vehicles rotated and the right side of V1 struck the left side of V2. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
