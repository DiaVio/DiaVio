This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and collided with the left front of Vehicle 2 (V2) which was traveling straight through the intersection. The impact occurred when the front of V1 struck the left front of V2, causing V2 to spin clockwise and continue forward, while V1 spun counter-clockwise.
