This is because V1 (Buick Park Avenue) entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck on the right side by the front of V2 (Lexus RX330). V1 then rotated counterclockwise and was struck on the right side by the left side of V2. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
