The accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there were no other entities involved. V1 rotated clockwise, departed the roadway, and struck a delineator post before rolling onto its left side. The critical reason for the accident was determined to be the driver's excessive speed for the curve/turn, indicating that the accident was caused solely by the actions of the driver of V1.
