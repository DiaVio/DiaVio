Justification: Vehicle 1 (V1) was turning left at the intersection, while Vehicle 2 (V2) was traveling straight through the intersection. V1 was impacted on the right side by the front of V2, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1). This aligns with the definition of a Front-to-Side Collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
