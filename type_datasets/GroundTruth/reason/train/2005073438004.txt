This is because Vehicle one (Hyundai GX300) was traveling north on a two-lane two-way roadway and was struck on its left side by Vehicle two (Dodge Dakota) which was traveling east and attempted to turn right at the intersection. The impact occurred between the front of Vehicle two and the side of Vehicle one, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
