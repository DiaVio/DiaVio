This is because V1, the 2002 Toyota 4Runner, entered the intersection on a red light and struck V2, the 1993 Honda Civic, on the left side as it was passing through the intersection in lane one of the secondary road. V1's rotation and final resting position facing north in the intersection, near the center left turn lane, suggest a collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2.
