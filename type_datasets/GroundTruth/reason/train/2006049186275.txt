This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac) and there was no mention of any other entities such as objects, persons, or other vehicles being involved in the crash. The vehicle veered off the road and rolled over due to a tread separation in the left rear tire, indicating a loss of control.
