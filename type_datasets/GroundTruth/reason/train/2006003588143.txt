This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. V1 was steering to the right in an attempt to avoid another vehicle (Non-Contact Vehicle) that cut in front of him, which resulted in V1 striking the concrete divider and rolling over.
