This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there were no other entities involved. V1 lost control and slid out of control, ultimately rolling onto its left side. The driver of V1 stated that she was having trouble seeing due to the rain and made a decision error by braking too much, causing the vehicle to skid and lose control.
