Justification: The accident involved vehicle one (Dodge Dakota pickup) colliding with the left side of vehicle two (Chevrolet Beretta coupe) as it was traveling southbound through the intersection. This is a classic "T-bone" collision where the front of one vehicle (vehicle one) collides with the side of another vehicle (vehicle two).
