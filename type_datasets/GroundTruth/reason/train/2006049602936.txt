This is because vehicle two (V2) attempted to change lanes to the left and the front of V2 struck the left side of vehicle one (V1). V1 was pushed to the left and the front struck the jersey barrier, while V2 also traveled to the left and the front struck the jersey barrier. This scenario describes a collision where the front of one vehicle (V2) collides with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
