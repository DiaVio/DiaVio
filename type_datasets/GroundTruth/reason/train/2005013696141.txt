This is because Vehicle 1, the 2001 Toyota Echo, entered the westbound travel lane and collided with the front left corner of Vehicle 2, the 1997 Chevrolet Lumina, just short of the turning lane. This collision occurred when the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2), resembling a "T-bone" collision.
