This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. The vehicle veered off the road, struck a mailbox and a utility pole before coming to a rest, and the driver stated that he had a seizure and blacked out, indicating that there was no involvement of another vehicle or entity in the accident.
