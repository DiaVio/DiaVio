Justification: The accident involves V1, a 2004 Ford Escape, traveling eastbound in lane one and V2, a 1998 Ford Windstar, traveling northbound in lane one. V1 was hit on the right rear tire by V2, causing V1 to rotate clockwise. This indicates that the front of V2 collided with the side of V1, forming a "T-bone" collision.
