This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) changed lanes to the left and the left plane of V1 contacted the right front bumper corner of Vehicle 2 (V2). The front of V1 then contacted the raised asphalt curb and proceeded into the embankment area, while V2 rotated counter-clockwise and the right plane of V2 contacted the center divider. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V1) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision.
