This is because V1, the Subaru Legacy, was turning left from a private drive and was struck on the left side by the front of V2, the Ford Expedition, which was traveling south in lane 2 of the arterial. This collision involved the front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, similar to a "T-bone" collision.
