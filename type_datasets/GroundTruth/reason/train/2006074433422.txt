This classification is justified by the description that vehicle one (2000 Buick Le Sabre) was traveling north and intended to go straight, while vehicle two (2003 Honda Accord) was traveling west and turned left at the intersection. Vehicle two was impacted on its left plane by the front plane of vehicle one, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another (T-bone collision).
