Backover Collision - This type of accident involves a vehicle reversing into an object, person, or another vehicle. In this case, the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of her vehicle on the wet roadway, resulting in the vehicle skidding and making contact with the guardrail. The back of V1 also made contact with the guardrail during the rotation. Although the vehicle ultimately rolled over, the initial impacts and loss of control indicate a backover collision.
