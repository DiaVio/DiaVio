Justification: The accident occurred when V1, which was intending to turn left, was struck on its left front corner by the front of V2, which was going straight. This collision involved the front of one vehicle (V2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
