Justification: 
- Vehicle one (V1) struck the back of vehicle two (V2).
- V2 had stopped to make a left turn, and V1 failed to stop in time, resulting in a collision from behind.
- The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 collided with a stationary vehicle in front of it.
- The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with higher speed," indicating that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2 before the collision.

Therefore, based on these factors, the accident can be classified as a Rear-End Collision.
