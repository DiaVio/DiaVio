Justification: Vehicle one (V1) entered the roadway from the gas station and crossed through lanes one and two, resulting in the front of V1 striking the right side of V2. This indicates that the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
