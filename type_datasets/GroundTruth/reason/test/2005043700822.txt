Backover Collision - The vehicle (V1) turned left and then traveled off the right side of the westbound roadway, indicating a backward movement. The driver braked and steered left, causing the vehicle to re-enter the roadway suddenly and lose control, resulting in a rollover. The driver's statement about another vehicle driving erratically next to him does not change the nature of the accident, as it was the driver's actions that led to the loss of control and rollover.
