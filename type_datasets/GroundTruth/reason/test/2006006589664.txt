This is because V1, a 2002 Mitsubishi Gallant, was traveling northbound in lane one and steered left to avoid parked cars, entering lane two. V1 was then contacted in the rear by the front of V2, a 2001 Kenworth tractor with a trailer, which was also traveling northbound in lane two. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 represents a front-to-side collision. Additionally, V1 subsequently collided with the rear of V3 and pushed it into the rear of V4.
