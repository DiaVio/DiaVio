The crash involved only one vehicle, with no other entities involved. The driver of the KIA Spectra lost control of the vehicle and drove off the right edge of the road, resulting in subsequent collisions with the undercarriage striking the ground, a concrete mile marker, and a utility pole. The vehicle then veered back onto the roadway and came to rest on the other side.
