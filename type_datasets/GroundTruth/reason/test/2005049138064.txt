Justification: Vehicle one (V1) merged from the second travel lane into the third lane and struck the rear of vehicle two (V2) with its front. It then continued to merge right and struck the rear of vehicle three (V3). This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2 and V3 in a "T-bone" fashion, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
