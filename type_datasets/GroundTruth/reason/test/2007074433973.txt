This is because Vehicle 1 entered the intersection turning left and was struck on the right side by the front of Vehicle 2. Additionally, Vehicle 1 then rotated clockwise and the left side struck the front of Vehicle 3. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (Vehicle 2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (Vehicle 1), which is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision.
