This is because V1 (the Honda Civic) failed to stop in time and collided with the back of V2 (the Nissan Murano). Subsequently, a chain reaction occurred with V2 colliding with V3, V3 colliding with V4, and V4 colliding with V5. This sequence of vehicles colliding from behind is characteristic of a Rear-End Collision.
