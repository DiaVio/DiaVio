This is because vehicle one (1996 Jeep Cherokee) was the only vehicle involved in the crash, as it departed all the westbound lanes, impacted a pole, and rolled over. Vehicle two (1999 Chrysler Concorde) was not directly involved in the crash but had its right side impacted by vehicle one while it was rolling over.
