This is because the accident only involved one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The description indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and it skidded across multiple lanes before going off the right edge of the roadway and ultimately coming to rest after hitting a small tree.
