This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) turned left in the intersection and was struck on its right side by the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). The vehicles rotated, and the right side of V1 then struck the left side of V2. The right side of V2 was further struck by the front of Vehicle 3 (V3). This sequence of events indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1 and V3), which falls under the category of Front-to-Side Collision.
