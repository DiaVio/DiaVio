This is because vehicle one (1994 Oldsmobile Silhouette) was intending to turn left and its front struck the front of vehicle two (2003 Nissan Altima). Additionally, vehicle three (2000 Dodge Durango) struck the back left corner of vehicle one. This collision involves the front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, similar to a "T-bone" collision.
