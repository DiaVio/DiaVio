This is because V1, the 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix, was waiting to turn right and was contacted by V2, the 2003 Ford Taurus, as it merged from lane two to lane one. The contact occurred at the right rear door area of V2, causing V2 to rotate clockwise, then counter clockwise, and then back clockwise before contacting the west curb and rolling onto its driver's side.
