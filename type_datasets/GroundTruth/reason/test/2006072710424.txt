Justification: Vehicle one, traveling southbound on a one-way road, entered the intersection and impacted the right side of vehicle two, which was traveling westbound in the first lane. Vehicle one then rotated clockwise and impacted the front of vehicle three, which was parked on an angle at the northeast corner of the intersection. This sequence of events indicates a front-to-side collision between vehicle one and vehicle two, followed by a secondary impact between vehicle one and vehicle three.
