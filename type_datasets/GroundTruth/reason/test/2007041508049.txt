This is because the accident only involved one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. The driver of V1 drifted off the right side of the roadway, made contact with a guardrail and signpost, and ultimately came to rest at the bottom of an embankment. There is no mention of any other vehicles being involved in the accident.
