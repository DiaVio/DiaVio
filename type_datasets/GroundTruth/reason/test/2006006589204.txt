The accident involves only one vehicle, the 1999 Chrysler Town & Country (V1), and there is no mention of any other entities involved. V1 lost control while negotiating a left curve, crossed over into another lane, and struck the concrete barrier wall on both the left and right sides of the roadway. The driver stated that another vehicle attempted to cross in front of him, but there is no evidence of a collision with another vehicle. Therefore, this accident can be classified as a single-vehicle accident.
