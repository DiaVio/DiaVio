Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was attempting to change lanes to the left and collided with the left rear bumper of vehicle two (V2). V1 then crossed all northbound lanes and was hit on the right side by V2. This collision pattern fits the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
