This is because Vehicle 2 (V2) was stopped at the stop sign and then entered the intersection, turning left, and was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle 1 (V1). The vehicles rotated and the left side of V1 struck the left side of V2. This describes a collision where the front of one vehicle (V1) collides with the side of another vehicle (V2), which is a front-to-side collision.
