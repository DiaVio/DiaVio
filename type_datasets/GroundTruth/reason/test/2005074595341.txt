This classification is justified because vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection to make a right turn and was struck on the left front fender by the front of vehicle two (V2), which was traveling north. V1's left side then side slapped with the right rear of V2. V1 then rotated to the right after the second impact with V2 and struck the left of vehicle three (V3) with its front. Therefore, the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, resulting in a front-to-side collision.
