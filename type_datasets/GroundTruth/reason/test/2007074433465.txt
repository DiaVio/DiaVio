This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) turned left in the intersection and the front of V1 struck the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). The vehicles then rotated, and the right side of V1 struck the left side of V2. This aligns with the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
