This is because Vehicle one (V1) attempted to pass through the intersection against the red light to turn left and struck the right side of Vehicle two (V2) while it was traveling westbound. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest facing northward with its front end off the roadway. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
