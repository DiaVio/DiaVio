This is because the accident only involves one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. The vehicle traveled off the left side of the roadway, struck an aluminum pole, a large concrete block, and ultimately ended up in a retention basin. The driver's medical condition and loss of consciousness were contributing factors to the accident.
