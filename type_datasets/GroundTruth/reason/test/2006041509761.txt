This is because V1, the Oldsmobile Aurora, made contact with the left side of V2, the Toyota Matrix, as they were approaching the intersection. The front of V1 also hit a concrete utility pole, indicating a collision with the side of an object. Both vehicles continued to travel in a southwest direction, and V2 made contact with V3 before coming to a final rest.
