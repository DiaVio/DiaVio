This is because V1 (2004 Subaru Impreza) entered the intersection and was turning right, while V2 (1996 Mazda Protégé) was eastbound and struck the left side of V1. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
