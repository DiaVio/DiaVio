Justification: V1, a Toyota Corolla, was traveling in the high-occupancy lane and struck the left side concrete barrier after the vehicle in front of it stopped suddenly. The Critical Precrash Event indicates that V1 was traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, which suggests that V1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended the vehicle in front.
