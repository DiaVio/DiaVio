Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was traveling north in the left turn lane and turned left across a double yellow lane line towards a private drive. Vehicle two (V2) was traveling southbound in the right turn lane. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1, resulting in a collision. This describes a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, which is a front-to-side collision or "T-bone" collision.
