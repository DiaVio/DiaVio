The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they traveled off the right side of the roadway, lost control, and then crossed the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as \"this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the right side,\" indicating that V1's actions led to the crash. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as \"driver related factor; internal distraction.\" This suggests that the driver of V1 was distracted, which likely contributed to their loss of control and subsequent collision with V2. Furthermore, the associated factors of V1's speed (traveling at approximately 89 kmph) and the driver's inexperience (having been driving for only one year) were also identified as contributing factors in this crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident."

The driver of V2 (the Chevrolet Cavalier) was traveling at a slower speed of 18-32 kmph (11-20 mph) due to the bad weather conditions. The driver of V2 attempted to steer right to avoid V1, but was unable to do so. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed for the conditions and loss of control, resulting in the collision with V2."

Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and her distracted driving, combined with the influence of drugs, make her primarily responsible for the accident."

This inattention led to V1's vehicle colliding with the left side of V2's vehicle, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way. While V2 (the driver of the 1987 Chrysler Fifth Avenue) stated that he saw V1 but thought they would stop, it is important to note that V2 was not required to stop at the intersection. V2 had the right of way and was proceeding straight through the intersection. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and their inattention while driving."

The critical precrash event for V1 was coded as \"This vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.\" This further supports the fact that V1 was not driving within their lane. 3.

In summary, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and loss of control, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two and subsequent crash into the guardrail."

Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to switch lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so, as the vehicle in front of him also began to move to lane one without activating the turn signal. This lack of caution and failure to properly check for other vehicles in the vicinity contributed to the crash. Furthermore, the case summary mentions that V1 had low tread on its tires, which could have affected the vehicle's traction and handling, making it more difficult for the driver to control the vehicle during the swerving maneuvers. Lastly, the driver of V1 had only 11 months of experience driving a pick-up truck, which suggests a lack of experience and potentially inadequate skills in handling such a vehicle at high speeds. Overall, the combination of aggressive driving, failure to maintain a safe following distance, improper lane change, low tire tread, and limited driving experience makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash."

In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their act of fleeing the scene, while V2 may have made a false assumption about V1's actions."

On the other hand, the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 (1991 Toyota Corolla) was coded as \"other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street turning into opposite direction.\" However, the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle, suggesting that Vehicle #2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance."

This is evident from the fact that V1 impacted the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, which was traveling straight in the opposite direction. Additionally, there is compelling evidence to suggest that the driver of V1 was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the crash. The driver's bloodshot eyes, talkativeness, and the statement made by one of the occupants of V1 about turning themselves in all indicate possible impairment due to drug use. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn and the potential impairment from marijuana use."

The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event being coded as \"inadequate surveillance.\" This means that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the stationary plaster mixer in the travel lane. This lack of attention and awareness led to the collision. Additionally, the driver's fatigue is considered a factor in this crash. With only 5 hours of sleep the night before and a regular sleep schedule that may not align with typical waking hours, the driver's alertness and ability to react quickly and appropriately may have been compromised. Furthermore, the driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle (having driven it less than five times in the last two months) could have contributed to the driver's inability to handle the situation effectively. Overall, the combination of inadequate surveillance, fatigue, and unfamiliarity with the vehicle makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash."

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as \"this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane.\" The critical reason for this event was coded as \"driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see).\" This indicates that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic, specifically V1 (the 1999 Pontiac Grand Am), before attempting to make a U-turn in the intersection. As a result, V1 collided with the front of V2, causing damage to both vehicles and debris from the crash striking V3 (the 2003 Ford Explorer). Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately survey the intersection and ensure it was safe to make the U-turn."

Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of prescription medication to control diabetes, which may have impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. Work-related stress due to work hazards was also mentioned as a contributing factor. In contrast, the driver of V2 (the Cadillac Seville) reported that she had a green light and was accelerating as she approached the intersection. She stated that she did not see V1 and took no evasive actions before being struck. While she was unfamiliar with the roadway, this alone does not appear to be a significant contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving, failure to stop for a red light, and potential impairment from medication and work-related stress."

V1 then continued in the opposing lane and was headed directly at V3 (the 2006 BMW 3-series sedan), which had to veer to the right to avoid the crash and ended up striking a utility pole. Although V1 claimed that a cat darted out in front of her vehicle, causing her to swerve and clip V2, the investigation determined that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason for V1 was incorrect evasive action. Additionally, factors such as fatigue, use of prescription medication to control asthma, unfamiliarity with the vehicle, and the wet roadway were associated with V1.

Furthermore, the unrestrained front right passenger of Vehicle 1 suffered serious injuries during the rollover. The lack of restraint use was confirmed by the absence of loading evidence on the front right seat belt system. The passenger's trajectory towards the left and impact with the steering wheel rim indicate that the lack of restraint contributed to the severity of their injuries.
