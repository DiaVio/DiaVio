The case vehicle, a 2004 Honda CRV, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway negotiating a curve to the left under rainy, daylight conditions. The case vehicle went off the roadway to the right, where it traveled down a ditch and struck a tree with its front right. V1 rotated approximately 100 degrees clockwise before coming to final rest. The 41 year old female driver and sole occupant of the case vehicle was not wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and both frontal airbags deployed. V1 was towed due to damage and the driver of V1 was transported to a trauma center with serious injuires.
