This case involved a belted, a 27-year-old male passenger seated in the second row right position of a passenger car responding to a frontal (off-set left) impact resulting in 'serious' injury(s). This two-vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a multi-lane, divided interstate traveling through an urban area. There was an elevation gain for the four southbound lanes with paved shoulders on either side of the roadway. The lanes passed under a surface street overpass at the site of incidence. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the early morning (dark-no lights) crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2006 Mercury Milan, 4-door sedan) was traveling southbound in the number-three lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The driver, front right seat passenger and the 2nd row right seat passenger (case subject) were using the belt restraints. The 2nd row left seat passenger was not restrained. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1996 Acura Integra) was stopped, disabled, facing west (perpendicular to traffic) in the number-three lane. The driver of V1, traveling uphill in darkness, approached V2 without seeing it and the front of V1 struck the right side of V2 (primary) , predominately forward of the A-pillar area. V1's frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact rotated V2 counterclockwise as it was set in motion southbound. V1 pushed V2 aside and rotated slightly counterclockwise as the left rear of V1 was struck (minor) by the right rear of the spinning V2. V1 came to rest, still in the number-four lane facing south. V2 came to final rest in the number-four lane facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The 2nd row right side passenger of V1 (case subject) was transported to a trauma facility.
