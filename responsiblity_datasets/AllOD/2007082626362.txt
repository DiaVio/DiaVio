This two vehicle midafternoon daytime collision occurred in the intersection of a four lane two-way arterial road, and a two-lane two-way arterial road. Both roadways are paved with asphalt. The eastbound approach of the roadway was level. Traffic flow through the intersection was controlled by on-colors traffic signal. The westbound approach of the roadway has an uphill grade of 10%. The speed limit for both vehicles is 40 kmph (25 mph). At the time of the crash the sky was clear with no adverse conditions. Traffic was congested.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Toyota Corolla sedan driven by a twenty eight (28) year old female, was traveling east in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Toyota Tundra pick-up truck driven by a twenty nine (29) year old male, was traveling west in lane one. V1 began her left hand turn and as she entered lane one of the westbound lanes V2 impacted the right rear of V1. V1 then rotated counter clockwise coming to rest on the north/west corner. V1 was towed due to damage and V2 was driven from scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was assigned to this driver as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view. Inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see) was considered an associative factor. The driver of V1 had been looking through other vehicles windows to see if it was clear and turning without good sight clearance. This driver was also running late for work and in a hurry. She had just finished one job and was on her way to another.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical event is not coded to this vehicle.
