Case Summary 2007-11-081

The weekday, early afternoon, single vehicle crash occurred in the paved median of 3 straight, level, bituminous, westbound lanes of a 6-lane, urban, interstate roadway with a positive barrier separating the westbound from the eastbound traffic. At the time of the crash it was daylight, the roadway was dry and the weather was clear. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 113 kmh (70mph). Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, a 1999 Buick Regal solely occupied by a 43 year-old female driver, was westbound in lane 3 of the roadway described above. The driver steered left onto the inside shoulder then right back into lane 3 then left again. V1 went into a counterclockwise yaw and exited the roadway to the left where it struck the median wall with its front, continued to rotate counterclockwise and struck the wall again with its back right. V1 came to final rest on the inside shoulder next to the wall facing north-northwest.

The driver stated that she was on her way to work taking a route that she uses daily and was on time. She said she was traveling westbound at about 65-70 mph overtaking a tractor trailer (a non-contact vehicle), which was westbound in lane 2. The driver said that the non-contact vehicle started to come over into her lane so she steered left onto the shoulder while braking. She then steered right, back into lane 3 but then steered left again to avoid the non-contact vehicle. She said she then lost control and spun to the left and struck the wall. She stated that she never made contact with the vehicle in lane 2.

The Critical Pre-crash event for V1 was: " This Vehicle Traveling off the edge of the road on the left side". The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash event was overcompensation. Some contributing factors on the part of V1 include the driver's choice of inappropriate evasive actions to a previous event and her use of cruise control in moderate to heavy traffic. Another factor was the roadway edge itself. The three westbound lanes had been newly paved and the inside shoulder had not. This meant that the pavement dropped off approximately 2-3 cm from the new pavement onto the inside shoulder. This may have contributed to the driver's loss of control.
