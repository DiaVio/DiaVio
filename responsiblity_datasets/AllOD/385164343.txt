Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 61-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2008 Dodge Caliber 4-door hatchback, which was involved in a frontal impact, with the concrete base of a parking lot street lamp. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of a summer weekday, within a parking lot area. This bituminous surfaced parking lot has a downhill grade for the southbound travel direction within the parking lot access lanes. For this particular crash, multiple parking spaces are present on the east side of the access lane, with a curbed and fenced border on the west side. There is no associated speed limit for this parking lot area and at the time of the crash, the parking lot surface was dry and the weather was clear. The 61-year old female case occupant was operating Vehicle 1, the 2008 Dodge Caliber 4-door hatchback, in one of the southbound parking lot access lanes. She had just entered the parking lot from a two lane roadway and was traveling through the parking lot at the time. She was utilizing a 3-point lap/shoulder belt (with pretensioner) and the vehicle was equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags, a driver's knee bolster air bag and roof side rail curtains (no deployments). Crash: As Vehicle 1 traveled south through the parking lot access lane, an animal (dog) reportedly approached or entered the travel path of Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 1 steered/swerved left and departed the access lane and entered the area of the eastside parking spaces. At this time, Vehicle 1 struck the concrete base of a parking lot lamp pole (located within one of the parking slots) with its frontal plane and came to rest, facing a southeasterly direction. There were no air bag deployments for this crash, nor any seat belt pretensioner actuation. Post-Crash: The 61-year old driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene as a result of damage sustained in the crash.
