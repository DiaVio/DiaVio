This case involves a frontal non-horizontal impact and rollover resulting in extremity injuries to the left front case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Honda Accord 4-door sedan, was travelling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane two-way roadway. At the time of the crash, it was daylight, and the weather was clear and dry. At the area of impact, the roadway narrows to pass under a railway bridge; the shoulder is eliminated and a stepped stone wall which supports the bridge is present on both sides of the roadway. The posted speed limit was 56 km/h (35 mph). The crash occurred when the driver of V1 became distracted and failed to notice the roadway narrowing. She impacted the stone incline of the bridge wall with the underside of her front right bumper, causing the vehicle to pitch upwards along the wall incline. The case vehicle then executed a counter-clockwise quarter turn onto its left side and slid into the opposite lane of travel. The vehicle then rolled another counter-clockwise quarter turn onto its roof, where it came to final rest. The 37 year old female driver was restrained by the manual 3-point lap and shoulder belt. The steering wheel-mounted frontal airbag deployed for her seating position. The right side curtain airbag also deployed, though there were no other occupants in the case vehicle. At the time of the vehicle inspection, the case occupant's cell phone was found open on the front dashboard, suggesting that she was talking on her cell phone at the time of the crash.
