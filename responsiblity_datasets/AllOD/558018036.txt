The case vehicle, a 1998 Ford 150 Super cab 4x2 pick-up truck, pulling a 27' camping trailer, was westbound on a two-lane roadway, approaching a four-leg intersection. Theres was a stop sign controlling westbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2) a 2000 Ford Taurus sedan was northbound approaching the same intersection. V2 had no traffic controls. As the case vehicle was making a right turn into the northbound lane it crossed the path of V2 and was struck on the left door by V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and side slap the left quarter panel of the case vehicle with its right side. The case vehicle veered into the southbound lane where it came to rest north of the intersection. V2 rotated approximately 170 degrees before it came to rest on the west side of the road. The case occupant is the unrestrained 47-year-old unrestrained male driver. His steering-wheel airbag did not deploy. The 12-year-old male left-rear passenger and the 10-year-old right-rear female passenger were both restrained. The driver was transported to a level one hospital. The two passengers were transported to a children's hospital for observation.
