This frontal crash case involves a 26 year old restrained female with a deployed air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occured during the daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occured on a two lane bituminous rural roadway basically straight in origin and with only a warning sign (traffic control device). The roadway is level and divided by an interupted yellow line. The case vehicle (V1), a 2004 four-door Honda Civic, was being driven northbound behind two slow moving medium/heavy vehicles. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to pass two slow moving medium/heavy vehicles by traveling across the single broken yellow line into the southbound lane of travel. For unknown reasons, V1 traveled off the (West) roadedge and slightly down an embankment, before impacting a 29 cm diameter tree resulting in a off-set frontal crash configuration.. After initial impact, V1 rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees before traveling to its final resting facing West. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by the 26 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. The availble steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The case occupant had severe injuries and was transported to a level 1 trauma center by a combination of ground and helicopter.
