This single vehicle crash involved a frontal impact off road into an embankment with a front right case occupant. The surface conditions were dry and the crash occurred at night with streetlights in the area. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Ford Escape was traveling north up a freeway off ramp to an intersection with left turn and right turn lanes. The driver of V1 had a medical event and accelerated through the intersection crossing over the four lane, two way street. V1 then impacted a raised curb median on the north side of the intersection that divided two on-ramp lanes. Both front tires and the left rear tire deflated and the rims were damaged on impact with the curb. V1 then continued over this curb median across one of the on ramp lanes and departed the roadway to the right into a ditch with an embankment. The front of V1 impacted the embankment with a non-horizontal direction of force. V1 then continued up the embankment where the front of V1 struck down some shrubs before the front then impacted a tree with very minor damage. V1 came to final rest against this tree facing northeast. V1 was damaged and towed. The driver, the front right case occupant and another occupant in the second left seat were all wearing the manual lap/shoulder seat belts in their positions. No air bags deployed in any position. The driver of V1 and the back left occupant both sustained minor injuries. The case occupant, a 75 year old female, sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital then transferred to the trauma center.
