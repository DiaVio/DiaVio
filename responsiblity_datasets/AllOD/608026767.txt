The case vehicle a two-door 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier was traveling south on the on-ramp to a six-lane divided highway with a median barrier, approaching the acceleration lane. It was daylight, raining and the roadway was wet. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 International tractor and semi-trailer was traveling in the center southbound lane approaching the on-ramp. The driver of the case vehicle lost control and the case vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise as it entered the acceleration lane. The case vehicle crossed the inside southbound lane and entered the path of V2 and under-rode the semi-trailer. The rear wheels of the semi-trailer struck the left side of the case vehicle and the driver of V2 subsequently applied his brakes. V2 came to rest in the center southbound lane. The case vehicle rotated approximately ten degrees counterclockwise after impact and came to rest straddling the inside and center southbound lanes. The vehicle was towed due to damage.

The case occupant the 22-year-old female driver was wearing the three-point belt and no air bag deployed. The driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
