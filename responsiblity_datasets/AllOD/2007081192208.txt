This two-vehicle crash occurred shortly past noon during daylight hours. The location was a rural State Route highway in an area of residential homes. The roadway was a bituminous two lane, two way with paved shoulders on both roadsides. There was a slight curve to the left with a slight negative grade. The weather was overcast and no sight visibility problems. The posted speed limit for both vehicles was 80 kmph (50 mph).

Vehicle one (V1) was a 1991 Ford Explorer XL 4x4 4-door SUV driven by a fifty two (52) year old male. V1 was stopped on the west shoulder facing southbound. The driver had pulled over to make a cell phone call. Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Toyota Xtracab pickup driven by a sixteen (16) year old male, was traveling southbound approaching the location where V1 was stopped. The driver of V1 completed his phone call, and pulled forward and into the path of V2. The driver of V2 applied his brakes and tried to steer left, but struck the left side near the front of V1. On impact V1 was redirected forward and to the right. V1 came to rest facing west with the front of the vehicle in the ditch on the west roadside. V2 rotated clockwise and rolled towards its left side. V2 traveled across to the east roadside and came to rest on its top in the ditch. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the left side of travel lane. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).
