This case involves an unrestrained 32 year old female driver in a 2014 Nissan Versa (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The driver's frontal steering wheel-mounted airbag, driver's side outboard seat-mounted airbag, and the left side curtain all deployed during the crash. The crash occurred on a level and dry, asphalt, and straight two-lane, two-way roadway during the daylight hours. The posted speed limit for both lanes of the roadway was 89 kph (55 mph). There were no adverse weather conditions and the atmosphere was clear. V1 was traveling north in the northbound lane of the roadway when it drifted off the roadway to the right. The driver noticed her vehicle off the roadway and began to apply her brakes and steer left. While on the roadside, V1 approached a private driveway and contacted the berm of the driveway with its undercarriage. V1 continued across the private drive and began to skid and yaw counterclockwise as it moved back left towards the roadway. V1 crossed over both lanes of the roadway then departed the roadway to the left. While on the left roadside V1 contacted a fence with its left side then a 100cm diameter tree with its front. This impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest while on the roadside while facing northwest. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by air. She was treated for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
