This crash occurred at night with street lights with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Toyota MR2 Spider, was travelling in lane two of the two northbound lanes of a six lane, two way roadway with a center left turn lane. The roadway had a steep downgrade to the north and the speed limit was posted at 40 mph/64 kmph. V1 attempted to change lanes and struck the pile of sand between lanes used for prior icy roadways. V1 lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise crossing over lane two, the center turn lane and then into the southbound lane 3. V1 almost did a complete rotation when the front of V1 impacted the front of vehicle two (V2), a 1986 Chevrolet Geo Prizm, sub-compact vehicle, travelling southbound in lane 3. V1 rotated clockwise 180 degrees post impact and came to final rest facing southwest in the southbound lane one. V2 remained in the same lane at final rest. Both vehicles were disabled and towed. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 35 year old male, who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt with the frontal airbag deploying. The case occupant was injured and transported to the trauma center.
