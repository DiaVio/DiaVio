This case involves an unrestrained 53 year old female driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Venture van (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal and dual first row outboard seat mounted airbags. The driver's frontal steering wheel mounted airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. V2, a 2005 Nissan Altima was also involved in the crash.
