The crash occurred in the eastbound lane of an eight-lane roadway divided by a cement curbed median. There were four eastbound and four westbound lanes. The roadway was straight and level. It was dawn on a weekend, the road was wet and it was clear with no adverse conditions. The speed limit was 48kmph (30mph) and traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1995 Lexus ES300 four door with three occupants, was traveling southbound in lane two. V2, a 2004 Ford Crown Victoria four door with one occupant was traveling eastbound and stopped at the intersection for the traffic control signal. V1 was attempting to pass a Non-contact vehicle in front of him. He changed lanes to the right, and at the same time, the Non-Contact vehicle attempted to change lanes to the right. As V1 attempted to change lanes back to the original lane, the Non-Contact vehicle did the same. Then V1 attempted to change lanes to the right when he lost control and skidded clockwise and the left front wheel contacted the steel curb and then the left front impacted a light pole. V1 continued to skid clockwise and the left side of V1 impacted the front of V2. V1 spun around and the right rear contacted a sign post and then came to a final rest on top of the south/west curb where a fire started in the engine compartment.
