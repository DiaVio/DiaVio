This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 65-year-old male unbelted driver with a deployed front airbag and a 61-year-old right front female unbelted passenger with non-deployed airbags. The vehicle was also occupied by a 31-year-old left rear male unbelted passenger and a 6-year-old right rear male passenger using a belt and booster seat. The driver suffered moderate injuries. The right front passenger died at a trauma center. The left rear and right rear occupants sustained police-reported incapacitating injuries. This vehicle was involved in an offset frontal impact to a rocky embankment followed by a rollover. The crash occurred midafternoon on a dry roadway in clear weather. A 2010 Chevrolet Malibu LT full-size sedan (Vehicle 1) was negotiating a left curve on a one-way, three-lane rural bituminous highway heading northeast. There was a 5% uphill grade with +8% superelevation in the curve. Road edge warning signs were present. As V1 negotiated the left curve, it traveled right over the hard shoulder and departed the right side of the roadway. V1 impacted a road edge warning sign with its front plane (Event 1). V1 traveled approximately 19 meters on the grass roadside before impacting a steep, rocky embankment with its front plane (Event 2). The embankment caused V1 to subsequently flip-over, rolling left three quarter turns (Event 3) to its right side. V1 slid on its right side before rolling back onto its top plane and coming to rest on the grass roadside. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 65-year-old male case occupant. He was unbelted with an actuated retractor pretensioner and a deployed steering wheel hub airbag. He was transported to a local trauma center by air where he was diagnosed with moderate injuries. The right front seat was occupied by a 61-year-old female case occupant. She was also unbelted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. No airbags were deployed for this occupant position. She was transported to a local trauma center where she died from her injuries. The second row left seat was occupied by an unbelted 31-year-old male non-case occupant. The available curtain airbag did not deploy. The kinematics of the rollover caused him to be completely ejected through the back rear window. He was transported to a local trauma center by air with police-reported incapacitating injuries. The second row right seat was occupied by a 6-year-old male non-case occupant. He was belted and using a child booster seat. The available curtain airbag did not deploy. He was also transported to a local trauma center by air with police-reported incapacitating injuries.
