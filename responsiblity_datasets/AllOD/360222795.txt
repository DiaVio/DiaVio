This head-on impact crash case involves a 70 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a frontal air bag deployment who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during daylight hours, in a four legged intersection, with rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier four door sedan, was traveling west on a five lane, two way, undivided roadway and was approaching an intersection controlled by traffic signals. The driver of V1 intended to make a left turn onto the intersecting street. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2008 Toyota Tundra large pickup, was traveling east in the inside eastbound travel lane, and was also approaching the intersection. V1 made a left turn as V2 was crossing straight through the intersection, and the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise, traveled a short distance east, and came to final rest near the southeast corner, facing southeast. After the initial impact, V2 traveled a short distance and came to final rest near V1, facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 70 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the collision. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
