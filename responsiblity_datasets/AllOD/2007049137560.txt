The driver of V1, a 63 year-old female was traveling to a grocery store from her office. She is familiar with the vehicle and travels the route daily. As she attempted the left turn, she did not detect the oncoming vehicle and therefore attempted no evasive. The driver decelerated but did not stop prior to the left turn. She stated the light had just turned yellow as she entered the intersection. The driver was on vacation the week prior to the crash.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded "this vehicle traveling-turning left at intersection." The critical reason was coded "inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)."
