This case involves two impacts between the undercarriage of a passenger car and two separate culverts. The restrained 27-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel mounted frontal impact air bag. The case vehicle, a 2006 4-door Cadillac CTS, was westbound on a dry, level, asphalt, two-lane road. It was dark and clear. The case vehicle departed the road off the right shoulder, entered a ditch and struck a culvert with its right wheel, traversed a private driveway, continued along the ditch and struck a second culvert with its undercarriage. It then entered a counterclockwise yaw, struck a post and rail fence with the top of its right fender. The vehicle came to rest facing south. The restrained 27-year-old male driver was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
