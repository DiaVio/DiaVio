Case Focus: The case occupant is a 35-year old male driver, of a 2006 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan, which was involved in a severe, frontal impact, with the frontal plane of a 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera 4-door sedan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours of a winter weekday, on a straight, two-lane roadway. This bituminous roadway runs generally north and south and has a slight hillcrest at the location of the crash. Prior to the crash area (hillcrest), both travel directions have positive uphill grades (greater than 2%). At the time of the crash, it was dark, but streetlights illuminated the scene. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for this roadway was 80 km/h (50 mph). The 35-year old male case occupant (sole occupant) was driving Vehicle 1, the 2006 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan, southbound. He was not restrained, but had the benefit of frontal impact air bag, which deployed as a result of the crash. A 66-year old male driver (sole occupant) was operating Vehicle 2, the 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, northbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 2 entered the southbound travel lanes as Vehicle 1 crested the slight hillcrest. Vehicle 2 struck Vehicle 1 head-on. Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 45 degrees and came to rest in the southbound travel lane. Vehicle 2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest in the southbound lane, in close proximity to Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver (case occupant) of Vehicle 1 was removed from the vehicle, by the responding emergency medical services personnel (EMS) and transported to a local trauma center (CIREN), by air unit. He was hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was also transported, by air, to a local trauma center with incapacitating injuries. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
