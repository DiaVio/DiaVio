The case occupant is an 80 year old male driver in a head-on frontal collision who was restrained with lap/shoulder belt with frontal and side impact air bag deployments and sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions on a two way, two lane highway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota RAV4 compact utility, was eastbound on this highway that curved slightly to the right. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Honda Odyssey minivan was westbound traveling opposite V1. Through the curve V1 continued straight and entered the opposite lane where the front left of V1 impacted the front left of V2. V1 then rotated counterclockwise 360 degrees across the eastbound lane and came to final rest facing east on the paved shoulder. V2 rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees and departed the roadway and came to final rest facing east in the ditch. Both vehicles were damaged and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant, an 80 year old male, who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the belt pretensioner actuated. The frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed along with the side impact seatback and the left side roof rail curtain air bags. This case driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
