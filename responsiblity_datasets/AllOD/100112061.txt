This case involved the driver of a passenger car responding to a frontal, off-set left, impact with another passenger vehicle. The case vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. This crash occurred at the four-way intersection of two residential streets. Both roadways had a single lane for travel in each direction without any painted lane designations. The intersection was controlled by stop signs at the east and westbound approaches. The southbound approach was straight and level. The northbound approach was straight with a slight downward grade. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the dusk, weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2001 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan) was traveling southbound on its approach to the intersection with the intention of traveling straight through. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 81-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2005 Lexus ES330, 4-door sedan) was traveling northbound on its approach to the intersection with the intention of turning left. As both vehicles reached the intersection simultaneously, V2 began a left turn into the path of V1. The front left of V1 struck the front right of V2. V1's frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact deflected V1 approximately 20-degrees clockwise to the right (southwest corner) where it came to rest facing southwest. V2 was deflected approximately 90-degrees counterclockwise where it came to rest on the soutwehst corner adjacent to V1 facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The subject (driver V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe" injury(s).
