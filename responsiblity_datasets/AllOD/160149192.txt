This frontal crash involves a 47 year old restrained male with deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two-lane bituminous roadway divided by a solid double line. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2008 Smart Fortwo coupe traveling south on the roadway and vehicle two (V2) is a Kia Rio sedan traveling north on the roadway. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons crossed over directly into the path of V2 resulting in a frontal crash for both vehicles. After impact, vehicle one rotated counterclockwise and rolled over two quarter turns, coming to final rest on its roof in the southbound lane. Vehicle two came to rest past the point of impact in the northbound lane. V1 was driven by a 47 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported by helicopter to a level-one trauma center.
