This frontal corner crash involves a 49-year-old unrestrained male with a deployed air bag who sustained a serious injury. The crash occurred under dark, dry conditions. It occurred on a two lane, two way roadway on a hill and a slight curve and divide by a solid double line. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2003 Acura 3.2 TL sedan being driven eastbound. Vehicle two (V2) is a 2003 Volvo S40 sedan being driven westbound. The crash occurred when V2, for unknown reasons, crossed the center line into the path of V1 where the left front corner of V1 struck the left front corner of V2. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise post-impact and both came to final rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage sustained during impact. V1 was driven by a 49-year-old male case occupant who was not wearing the available 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center by ambulance for treatment.
