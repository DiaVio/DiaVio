This moderate severity rollover crash involves a 22 year old female driver who sustained severe injuries and was wearing the available lap/shoulder belt with no airbag deployments. This crash occurred during daylight hours on a four lane divided freeway with clear, dry conditions. The dividing grassy, sand based median was gradually sloped on both sides and the travel lanes are bordered with paved shoulders. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Nissan Altima four door sedan, was eastbound in lane one of the two eastbound one way lanes. For unknown reason the driver swerve left and loss control of the vehicle. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise as it crossed over lane two and the paved shoulder before departing the roadway to the left into the median. The tires of V1 then dug into the soft sand and V1 began to rollover to the right. The right side of V1 then contacted and uprooted some sage brush before the top of V1 contacted the ground. V1 continued to rollover across the median and into the westbound lanes for eleven quarter turns and came to final rest in lane two on its driver's side facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver who is a 22 year old female driver and was wearing the available lap/shoulder belt with no airbag deployments. She sustained severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
