This case involves a severe left side impact event resulting in serious injuries to the right rear-seated case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Hyundai Sonata, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a three-lane, two-way roadway (one lane northbound, a left turn lane, and one lane southbound) and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Mack dump truck was traveling west in the left westbound through lane of the intersecting seven lane divided trafficway (two west bound thorugh lanes, left-turn lane, grassy median, two east bound lanes and two paved shoulder lanes on either sides). Both V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left-side of V1 in an L-type configuration. On impact, V1 began to move northwesterly and rotated in a counterclockwise manner. V1 crossed the grassy median of the west leg of the intersection, striking a sign post in the median with the right side of V1. V1 continued across all three eastbound lanes while continuing to rotate counterclockwise, departed the south edge of the road and stuck another sign post with the left fender. V1 came to rest against this sign post, off the south edge of the road facing south-southwest. After the initial impact, V2 continued westbound through the intersection and came to a controlled stop in the left westbound lane facing west. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven from the scene. The case vehicle was driven by a 38-year-old female (non-case occupant) who was using the available three-point seat belt and the seatback-mounted side air bag deployed. She sustained minor injuries and was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital. The 12-year-old female right-rear passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed in her seating position. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
