Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Ford Focus, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the right westbound lane of a 5-lane limited-access, divided freeway (three lanes westbound, unprotected grassy median, two lanes eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Mercury Mariner, 4-door utility vehicle was also traveling west but in the left westbound lane and slightly behind V1. It was daylight, cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was wet. The driver of V1 lost control, reportedly due to hydroplaning and departed the right side of the road. V1 began to yaw/rotate in a counterclockwise manner and the right-rear quarter panel of V1 struck a 41-cm diameter tree. V1 came to rest against this tree facing south-southwest. The driver of V2 also lost control of her vehicle, reportedly due to hydroplaning, and departed the right side of the road. V2 began to yaw/rotate in a clockwise manner and the left side of V2 struck the left side of V1. V2 came to rest against V1 facing north-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 55-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt during the right-side/tree impact but had removed the seat belt just prior to the left-side impact with V2 and no air bags deployed during any of the crash events. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
