This frontal crash case involves a 64 year old unrestrained female with a deployed air bag who sustained a serious injury. The crash occurred during the daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The case vehicle was traveling on a two lane bituminous roadway basically straight in origin and without any intersection or traffic control device involvement. The travel lanes are level and is separated by a double yellow line. The right side roadedge is a grassy area that descends down a hillside (approx 275 yards) and then begins to ascend. The case vehicle (V1) a 2002 four door Toyota Highlander was being driven northbound. The crash occurred when the driver of V1 intentionally steered the vehicle off the right edge of the roadway (onto the grass) and down a hillside where the front lower frame impacted the ground before traveling to its final resting position at the base of the hill. This vehicle was towed from the scene. Our 64 year old female case occupant was seated in the front right seating position, was not restrained by the three point manual seat belt. The available instrument panel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the crash. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a local hospital and then subsequently transferred to a local trauma center. The 62 year old male driver was seated in the front left seating position, was restrained by his three point manual seat belt. The seat belt pretensioner (retractor type) did actuate as a result of the crash. The available steering wheel mounted driver air bag did deploy as a result of the crash. This occupant was transported by ground to a local trauma center for treatment of his injuries and then released the same day.
