This crash occurred at a four-way intersection. Each roadway was two-lanes and undivided. The north/south roadway curved to the left, had a slight downhill grade, and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The east/west roadway was straight, had a downhill grade, and had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Both roadways were bituminous. It was early evening on a weekday and conditions were clear.

V1 was a 2002 Ford Expedition, driven by an 18 year-old female. V2 was a 2006 Hummer H3 driven by a 37 year-old female. V1 was traveling westbound and stopped at the stop sign to the intersection. The vehicle pulled into the intersection and impacted V2, which was traveling southbound. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was "driver related factor, inadequate surveillance." The driver stated that she did come to a complete stop at the stop sign and then crept forward several feet, looking in both directions as she did so. It seems that she looked back to the right side as she pulled out and never looked to the left again to see V2. The driver also stated that the southbound roadway has a dip in it where it curves and it is hard to see oncoming vehicles. Upon inspection of the scene it appears that there is a dip in the road, however it should still be possible to see oncoming vehicles, especially when driving an SUV. No additional associated factors were coded.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was "other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. The driver stated that she saw V1 creeping past the stop sign and that the vehicle "just never stopped." She attempted to steer to the left, but there was not enough time to avoid the collision. No associated factors were coded to the driver of V2.
