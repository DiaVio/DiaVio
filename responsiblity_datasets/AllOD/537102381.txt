Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Honda Accord EX-V6, 2-door coupe was traveling north in the northbound through-lane of a three-lane, two way rural roadway (one northbound through/right-turn lane, one northbound left-turn lane, and one southbound lane) and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way roadway and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was dark, the sky was cloudy, and the bituminous road was dry. Both V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 16-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 15-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. The case vehicle is equipped with seat-back mounted and roof siderail mounted airbags on both the right and left front seat positions but none of these airbags deployed. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
