Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Expedition, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V1, while traversing an uphill grade, lost control of the vehicle due to the icy roads and the vehicle went into a slight clockwise yaw as it departed the right side of the road. V1 entered a steep ditch (two meters below road grade) and the front of V1 struck and penetrated a wire fence while the left side of V1 struck a large tree. V1 came to rest against the tree. The 44-year-old female driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. V1 was towed due to disabling damage.
