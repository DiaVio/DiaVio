This case involves an impact between the front of a passenger car (Vehicle 1) and the rear end of a large passenger van (Vehicle 2). The case occupant is the driver of V1. The case vehicle, a 2008 four-door Chevrolet Cobalt (V1), was travelling in the outside eastbound lane of a dry, 3% uphill grade asphalt three-lane roadway approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a Ford 2010 E-350 Passenger Van was travelling eastbound in the same lane. It was daylight and clear. V2 stopped at the intersection due to the traffic light and V1, who was traveling at a higher speed, struck V2â€™s rear end and under-rode V2. After impact both vehicles came to rest facing east in the outside eastbound lane. The unrestrained 42-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact air bag. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
