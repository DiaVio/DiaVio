This case involved both the belted thirty-seven year old male driver and the belted twelve year old male second row right seat passenger of a passenger car responding to a frontal impact with a stopped fire truck. The case vehicle damage rating was 'severe' as a result of the twelve o'clock principal direction of force impact. The frontal-impact air bags deployed, as did the left and right curtain side-impact air bags, and the driver's seat back mounted side-impact air bag. The driver and right rear subjects received serious to severe injuries, respectively. This two-vehicle crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a divided, multi-lane, interstate traveling through an urban area. There were five lanes for northbound travel with an entrance ramp adjoining from the east side. The northbound approach to the crash site was straight with a slight uphill grade. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the early morning (dark-not lit) weekend crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2008 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan) was traveling northbound in the number-two lane (second from right). V1's first row lap and shoulder belts were pretensioner equipped. V1 was also equipped with first row frontal-impact air bags, first row seat back mounted side-impact air bags, and left and right roof rail mounted side-impact curtain air bags. There were three occupants in V1. The thirty-seven year old male driver, thirty-eight year old female front right seat passenger and the twelve year old male second row right side passenger were all using the belt restraints. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2007 Saulbur Fire truck) was stopped for emergency purposes across the number one and two lanes. V2 had its emergency lights and siren activated as it responded to a previous incident. As the driver of V1 approached the scene he noticed traffic was slowing in front, and to the left of him. The driver changed lanes to the right with the intent of going around the back of the truck to the right. The front of V1 struck the back left of V2 and underrode the larger vehicle (offset left) The impact moved V2 approximately one meter as V1 rotated clockwise into the rear deck. V1 came to rest against V2 facing north east. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. All three occupants of V1 were transported to trauma facilities. The driver (subject 1) sustained serious injury, the front right seat passenger moderate injury and the second row right seat passenger (subject 2) severe injury as a result of the crash.
