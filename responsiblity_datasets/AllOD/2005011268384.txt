The crash occurred at an intersection on a clear and dry, sunny weekend in the late afternoon. V1, a 2001 Ford F150 pick-up truck, was southbound on a straight, level, bituminous, two-way, two-lane road with a statutory speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), controlled by a stop sign at the intersection. V2, a 2003 Mercury Sable, was eastbound on a two-way, 3 lane, straight, level, bituminous road with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph), with no traffic control at the intersection.

V1 a 2001 Ford F150 was traveling southbound, he stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded through the intersection. V2 a 2003 Mercury Sable was traveling eastbound with no traffic control. V1's front hit V2 in the left side. V1 came to final rest facing southeast on the southeast corner. V2 rotated counterclockwise following the impact and came to rest facing west on the southeast corner. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 46 year-old male driver of V1 stopped at the stop sign, looked but did not see V2, and pulled into the crossing roadway. The front of V1struck the left side of V2. The driver of V1 stated that possibly the two wooden utility poles on the northwest corner might have obstructed his view of the oncoming V2. The driver saw the other vehicle at the last moment prior to impact and had no time for avoidance maneuvers. The fully restrained driver denied any injuries in the crash. V1 was towed due to damage from the scene.

The Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was 'this vehicle traveling crossing over (passing through) intersection.' The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as 'recognition error, inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see)'. The two wooden utility poles were close together and had a combined diameter of approximately 75 cm. It was observed during the scene inspection that the poles could completely block the view of a single vehicle as it approached the intersection. (See scene images) Further consideration was given to the possibility that the right A pillar of V1 might have contributed to the sight line obstruction. A Contributing Factor was coded to this driver of a sight line restriction - the two poles. Had the driver double-checked prior to pulling into the intersection, he would have seen V2.
