This case involved a belted, 21-year-old male driver responding to a frontal impact with a building, resulting in gross vehicle rotation, and frontal impact air bag deployment. The vehicle was damaged, moderately, and the subject sustained a serious head injury. This single-vehicle crash occurred on an east/west, two-lane trafficway traveling through a residential area. Westbound, the roadway had a long, straight stretch followed by a sweeping right curve, marked with a warning sign. There were homes/driveways along each side of the street. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the early morning (dark, street lights), weekend crash. The Case Vehicle (2002 Chevrolet Blazer, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling westbound. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint. The subject entered the sweeping right curve and immediately crossed the centerlines. Scene evidence would suggest that the subject began steering right and braking in an effort to control the vehicle. However, the vehicle left the roadway to the left (south) as it entered into an ever-increasing, clockwise yaw. The vehicle yawed across a lawn and a driveway until striking the east wall of a house. The vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. The vehicle's front broke through the wall, increased the CW rotation and the left plane struck the remaining wall in a 'side-slap' type impact. The continued impact fractured the remaining wall and, apparently, a narrow, vertical object (2x4 stud) struck the subject's door and became positioned in the subject's window space causing slight intrusion to that sector. The vehicle came to rest within the perimeter of the house (a bedroom) facing northwest. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
