The crash occurred on an east/west rural two lane residential road. Westbound the road makes a reverse S-curve, curving first to the right with a radius of curvature of 102m and then back to the left with a radius of 94m. The road had an uphill grade varying between 10-12% and a super elevation that varied from +10% (south) at impact to -3% (north) 40m east of impact. Conditions were daylight and wet on a weekday afternoon, rain had stopped falling just prior to the crash. The posted speed limit on the lightly traveled road was 35mph (56kmph).

Vehicle #1 was a 1997 Kia Sportage sport utility vehicle traveling westbound. As the Vehicle #1 exited the curve right the vehicle began to slide clockwise on the wet road. The vehicle apparently went into the eastbound lane and the driver lost control. The Kia (V1) then returned to the westbound lanes before departing the right (north) side of the road near the apex of the 2nd portion of the reverse S-curve, which went back to the left (south). Vehicle #1 struck a utility pole that was 2.6m off the road with its front. After impact the Kia (V1) rolled over one quarter turn on to its right side where it came to rest facing west near the pole. The pole was sheared in two and downed power lines in the area. Vehicle #1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 28-year-old female that was belted with deployed frontal and knee airbags. She was not transported to a medical facility from the scene.
