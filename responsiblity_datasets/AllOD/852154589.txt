This near-side impact crash case involves a 16 year old restrained male driver with a deployed seat back mounted side air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during the evening hours on a dark two lane, two way roadway illuminated by street lights. At the time of the crash, it was raining and the asphalt travel lanes wet. The case vehicle one (V1), a two door 2007 Ford Focus hatchback, was traveling north in lane one and was negotiating a left curve. While negotiating the curve, the driver lost control of the vehicle and V1 began go into a clockwise yaw. V1 traveled across the paved shoulder and departed the roadway to the right. The front of V1 scraped along the curb as V1 traveled over it, resulting in very minor damage. Then the front right of V1 swiped along the base of a small tree that was located in the planting strip adjacent to the roadway, also causing minor damage. V1 continued rotating clockwise as it slid north. The left side driver's door of V1 then impacted another tree located in the planting strip, uprooting the tree from its base and resulting in the deployment of the driver's seat back mounted side air bag. V1 continued a short distance north and came to final rest on the sidewalk, facing southeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 16 year old male driver of V1 in the front left position who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat back mounted side air bag deployed; his seat belt retractor pretensioner did not actuate. This case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. A 17 year old female passenger was restrained with the lap/shoulder belt in the front right seat and had no injuries.
