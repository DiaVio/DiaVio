This case involved a 42 year old restrained male driver of a 2007 Chrysler Pacifica wagon (V1). He was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt and had a deployed frontal airbag and knee bolster airbag. The inflatable side curtain airbag did not deploy in the crash. There was one other vehicle involved in the crash, a 1998 Honda CR-V compact sport utility vehicle (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours on a straight and level interstate highway. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 113 kph (70 mph). Both vehicles were traveling south with V2 traveling in the center (lane 3) of five lanes with the right lane for the merging traffic only. V1 was traveling in the 2nd lane just to the right and back of V2. V1 was traveling at an unknown speed when it changed lanes to the left in an attempt to cross the center lane and enter the fourth travel lane (to the left of V2). The front right corner of V1 struck the rear left bumper of V2, causing V2 to travel off the right shoulder of the roadway and down the sloping roadside. V2 rotated clockwise and rolled onto its left side and continued rolling four quarter turns to final rest. V1 continued forward approximately 80 meters before striking a guardrail face on the right side of the roadway. V1 came off of the guardrail and rolled to the left four quarter turns to final rest on the paved shoulder of the highway. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The driver of V2 was pronounced dead at the scene.
