Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Dodge Stratus, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a six lane divided freeway (three lanes eastbound, protected median/median barrier, three lanes westbound). For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and V1 crossed the left shoulder striking the median wall with the left-front bumper corner. As V1 continued easterly, the left-rear quarter panel then struck the median wall and V1 continued in a south-easterly direction. V1 crossed all three lanes of travel and the right shoulder where it then struck the tri-beam guardrail with the right-front bumper corner. This impact redirected V1 back into the road and V1 came to rest in the right eastbound lane, facing northeast. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 32-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was the lone occupant of V1, was not using the available three-point seat belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment.
