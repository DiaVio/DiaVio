This near-side impact crash case involves a 19 year old restrained female with deployed frontal and side air bags who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during the early morning hours in a six legged intersection controlled by traffic signals. One of the three intersecting roadways was closed for construction. The remaining two intersecting streets are five lane, two way, undivided roadways with center left turn lanes. Both are comprised of asphalt and were wet at the time of the crash. It was raining and dark, and the intersection was illuminated by overhead street lights. The case vehicle one (V1), a two door hatchback 1999 Volkswagen Beetle, was traveling south in lane two of five and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1992 Ford Explorer XLT, was traveling east on the intersecting street in lane three of five. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles rotated clockwise and traveled in a southeastern direction. V1 came to final rest facing northeast near the southeast corner after rotating about 300 degrees. V2 came to final rest near the same corner, facing southwest after rotating about 120 degrees. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 19 year old female passenger of V1 in the front right position who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, and the instrument panel mounted frontal air bag and the seat back mounted side air bag both deployed. This case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center.

She sustained minor injuries and transported to the trauma center. The second row right side passenger was a 15 year old male who was not restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt.
