The case occupant is a 28 year old male driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a moderate frontal impact. The case occupant's frontal impact air bag deployed and he sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred at night in darkness with overhead street lights under clear, dry roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the east/west asphalt roadway consists of two west and two eastbound travel lanes. In one area there is a center unprotected asphalt strip separating the lanes. For westbound vehicles, there is a right curve and downhill grade. There are curbs present on both side of the roadway and on the south side there is a grassy area followed by an embankment. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Kia Sorento compact utility vehicle, was traveling west in the inside westbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee compact utility vehicle, was traveling east in the inside eastbound lane. As both vehicles were negotiating the curve, V1 departed the lane to the left, crossed over the center paved strip, traveled into V2's lane of travel and V1's front left impacted V2's left side, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. V1 continued traveling west for a distance before coming to final rest in the inside eastbound lane, facing west. After the initial impact between V1 and V2, V2 rotated counterclockwise, crossed the outside eastbound lane, traveled up and over the south curb and came to final rest partially off the roadway, facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 28 year old male driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed during the crash. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
