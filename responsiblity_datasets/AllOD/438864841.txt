This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an 89-year-old male belted driver with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant was driving a 2012 Toyota Camry intermediate size sedan when it was involved in a front-plane rear-end collision to the back of a full size sedan. The case vehicle sustained severe damage. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred mid-evening under cloudy skies on a dry road which was dark and not lit. A 2012 Toyota Camry intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling northwest on a two-lane, two-way road. A 2009 Honda Accord full size sedan (Vehicle 2) was stopped in traffic in the same lane ahead of V1 waiting to turn left into a parking lot. The road was level in all directions. Vehicle 1 continued straight. The front of V1 impacted the back plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 traveled a short distance into the oncoming lane before coming to rest. V2 traveled across the oncoming lane and departed the road to the left, coming to rest in the parking lot. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case vehicle was occupied by an 89-year-old male belted driver. He was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by 4 cm of lap belt payout and latch plate loading. The retractor pretensioner actuated. No buckle or anchor pretensioners were installed. The steering wheel hub, driver's knee bolster, and both curtain airbags deployed in the crash. Non-deployed airbags included the right instrument panel, right knee bolster, and first and second row outboard seatback airbags. This occupant was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
