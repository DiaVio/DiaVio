The two case occupants are a 77-year-old, restrained male driver and a 74-year-old, restrained female right front passenger in a 2007 Lincoln Town Car sedan involved in a frontal collision with a tree. Vehicle one, (V1), a 2007 Lincoln Town Car sedan, was traveling west in lane one of a two lane, one way leg of a four lane, divided highway under dry, daylight conditions and was negotiating a curve to the right. For unknown reasons, V1 traveled off the roadway to the right where it struck a tree with its front. V1 subsequently had a fire start in the engine compartment. V1 came to final rest next to the tree and was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 77-year-old male and a case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deploy. The right front passenger of V1, a 74-year-old female and also a case study occupant, was also properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the instrument panel-mounted frontal airbag deploy. Both occupants were transported to trauma centers for treatment.
