This near side impact case involves a 39 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with no air bag deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way, undivided east-west roadway, during daylight hours, with dry roadway and clear weather conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, there are no curbs on either side of the travel lanes. On the north side, there is a grassy area that slopes away from the roadway, leading to an area containing a wood fence and several trees. In V1's precrash area, the lanes curve to the left with a downhill grade. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Ford Mustang convertible, was westbound and was approaching the curve. V1 began negotiating the curve when the driver lost control of the vehicle, overcorrected and began to travel into the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 steered to the right and as she moved back into the westbound lane, V1 began to go into a clockwise yaw. V1 traveled towards the north side of the street and departed the roadway to the right. V1 continued a short distance and then the front of V1 impacted a wood fence, resulting in minor damage. Then V1's left side impacted a tree, resulting in moderate damage. V1 rotated clockwise off the tree and the left side of V1 impacted the wood fence. V1 traveled a short distance west and the back of V1 impacted a group of mailboxes. Then as the mailbox post sheared off its base, the back of V1 struck the mailbox post, resulting in minor damage. V1 came to final rest near the damaged mailboxes, facing southeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 39 year old female, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
