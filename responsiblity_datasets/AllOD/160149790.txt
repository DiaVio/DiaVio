This narrow frontal crash involves a 68-year-old restrained female without air bag deployment who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred at dawn under dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two lane, two way residential roadway with street parking on both sides of the roadway. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2002 Toyota Camry sedan being driven eastbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Volkswagen Passat sedan and Vehicle three (V3), a 1995 Ford Explorer, were both unoccupied and parked facing westbound. The crash happened when V1, for unknown reasons, drifted out of its lane, entering the westbound lanes and continuing through the westbound lane where the front of V1 struck the left side of V2. This impact pushed V2's rear into the front of V3. All three vehicles came to immediate final rest after impacts and all three were towed due to vehicle damage. V1 was being driven by the 68-year-old female case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had no air bag deployment. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital for treatment and then transferred to a level-one trauma center for definitive care.
