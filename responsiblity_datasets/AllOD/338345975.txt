This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 53-year-old female belted driver with a deployed airbag (Vehicle 1). This occupant sustained serious injuries in a head-on collision with V2. The 23-year-old male driver of V2 sustained police-reported incapacitating injuries. The crash occurred late evening on a dry, unlighted road. A 2010 Chevrolet Malibu LT full-size sedan (Vehicle 1) was negotiating a right curve on a rural bituminous two-lane, two-way road heading west. The grade was level with 7% banking in the curve. It was dark and the roads were dry. A 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 2) was traveling east in the opposite direction in the oncoming lane of travel. V2 negotiated the left curve in the oncoming lane of travel before colliding head-on with V1 (Event 1). After impact, V2 rolled left one quarter-turn onto its left plane (Event 2), coming to rest against a guardrail with its top plane (Event 3). Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 53-year-old female case occupant. She was belted by a lap and shoulder belt and a deployed steering wheel airbag. The retractor pretensioner was actuated. The available right instrument panel, side seatback, and curtain airbags did not deploy. She was transported to a distant trauma center by air, where she was treated for serious injuries. V2 was driven by a 23-year-old male non-case occupant. He was reportedly belted by a lap and shoulder belt and a deployed frontal airbag. The vehicle was not equipped with side airbags. He sustained police-reported incapacitating injuries.
