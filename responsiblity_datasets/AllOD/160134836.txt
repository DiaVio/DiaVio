Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan Altima sedan, was traveling north in lane two of a five-lane, northbound leg of an interstate under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Chevrolet Aveo sedan, was traveling north in lane four of the same roadway. V1 hit a patch of ice and began to skid counterclockwise, passing through lane three and into lane four, where the left side of V1 was struck by the front of V2. This impact caused V1 to continue rotating counterclockwise where it went off the road to the left and struck a concrete traffic barrier with its right rear and then right front. V1 came to rest facing traffic on the left shoulder. V2 came to rest in lane five of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 54-year-old male and case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and no airbags deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
