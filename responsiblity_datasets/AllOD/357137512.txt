This case involves left-side impact (nearside relative to the case occupant) between the case vehicle, a passenger car and a large pick-up truck. The 63-year-old female driver is the case occupant. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel, seat-back mounted and roof side-rail curtain airbags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2010, four-door, Kia Soul was traveling in the eastbound left turn-lane of a dry, level asphalt three-lane road approaching the intersection with a six-lane road. Vehicle two (V2) a 2007, Toyota Tundra pick-up truck was in the inside southbound lane of the intersecting roadway approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle was making a left-turn though the intersection the front of V2 struck the case vehicle on the left side. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise through the intersection and into the northbound left turn-lane facing south-southwest. V2 rotated counterclockwise through the intersection and came to rest straddling the northbound travel lanes facing southwest. The 63-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel, seat-back mounted and roof side-rail curtain airbags deployed. She was transported to a level-one trauma center with multiple moderate injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
