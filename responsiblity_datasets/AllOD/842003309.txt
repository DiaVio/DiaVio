This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 3 year old male rear left passenger of a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier 2-door coupe. The child passenger was restrained within a Dorel forward facing child safety seat, and secured to the vehicle seat by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an embankment impact (event #1). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed the vehicle to depart the right (east) pavement edge. Driver steering input re-directed the vehicle back across the roadway in a counterclockwise rotation. Vehicle 1 subsequently departed the left (west) pavement edge where the frontal area impacted an embankment (event #1). Impact resulted in moderate damage. Vehicle 1's counterclockwise rotation continued as it rebounded off the embankment and again traversed the roadway, departing the east pavement edge where the rear right area impacted a ditch (event #2). This secondary impact resulted in moderate rear damage. Vehicle 1 came to rest in the ditch (off the east pavement edge) facing southwest. The restrained 27 year old male driver, and restrained 27 year old female front right passenger of Vehicle 1 were treated at the scene for minor injuries sustained in the crash (not transported to a medical facility). The 5 year old female rear right passenger was restrained within a child safety seat (unknown make/model), and was reportedly uninjured. The 3 year old male rear left child passenger was transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and hospitalized. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
