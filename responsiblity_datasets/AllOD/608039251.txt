This case involves a primary front-end to front-end impact resulting in severe injuries to the unrestrained 39-year-old male driver. The case vehicle, a four-door 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix was in the outside northbound lane of a divided eight-lane highway. Vehicle two (V2) a four-door 1995 Oldsmobile Aurora was southbound on the same roadway, in the lane to the right side of the case vehicle. V2 crossed the lane line and the front of V2 struck the front of the case vehicle in an off-set mode. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise. As it rotated the back of the case vehicle end swiped the concrete median barrier, before it came to a rest facing south-southeast. V2 rotated approximately 360 degrees as it crossed the roadway and came to rest in the inside distress lane facing south. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 39-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with severe injuries and later enrolled as a case occupant.
