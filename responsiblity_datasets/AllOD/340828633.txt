This case involves an oblique, side-impact to the corner of the left fender of a passenger car and the front of another passenger car. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car sustaining the oblique-angle, side-impact. The case vehicle (V1), a 2006 four-door, Ford Focus, was northbound on dry, level, two-lane, concrete road approaching a four-leg intersection. The roadway narrows on the approach to the intersection as the legal parking lanes end. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 four-door Hyundai XG350, was in the outside eastbound lane of the intersecting five-lane road approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle was making a left-turn through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left fender of the case vehicle, at the front corner. The impact resulted in the case vehicle rotating clockwise until it came to rest on the east side of the intersection, near the raised median for east-west traffic, facing northeast. V2 yawed counterclockwise, crossed into the inside eastbound lane, exited the intersection, rode over a raised median and came to rest in the westbound left-turn lane facing northeast. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the restrained 46-year-old male driver. He had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
