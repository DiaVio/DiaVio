This single-vehicle crash occurred during late afternoon, with overcast, dusk conditions, on a weekday. The collision occurred on a straight, three-lane, undivided residential roadway with an 11-degree downhill grade. The road surface is bituminous, and was icy because it was snowing at the time of the crash. There had been a heavy hail and sleet storm just before the snowfall began. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 40 kmph (25 mph). Access to the roadway is not controlled.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Explorer 4-door SUV was headed west in lane 1. As V1 crested the hill, the driver noticed the icy roadway and began intermittently applying her brakes as she had been taught to do.
