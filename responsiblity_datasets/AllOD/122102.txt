Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford Windstar, minivan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 fell asleep, drifted to the left, departed the left side of the road, traversed a ditch running parallel to the road and sideswiped a double trunk tree with the left side. V1 continued in an easterly direction and struck another double-trunk tree with the front end and came to rest. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 23-year-old male driver (case occupant) was alone in the vehicle, was using the available three-point seat belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
