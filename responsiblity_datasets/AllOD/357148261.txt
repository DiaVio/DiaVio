The 183-cm, 64 kg/ (6'0", 140 lb.), 18-year-old male driver of the 2005 2-door Chevrolet Cobalt was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. During the severe, 2 o'clock, right-side (far side) impact with the pole he moved inboard and forward relative to the vehicle interior. The central forehead laceration, the right sided frontal bone fracture, with hemorrhage of brain matter, the diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, the diffuse subdural hemorrhage, the lacerations of the right frontal lobe, the contusions to the left and right lobes of the cerebrum, the fracture of the right sphenoid bone, the right eyelid contusions, the bilateral cheek abrasions, the lower lip and chin lacerations, the right forehead abrasion and the hemorrhage into the medial and lateral sclera of right eye were are probably due to contact with the intruding right roof side rail, but possibly due to contact with the intruding pole. The right 7th and 8th rib fractures and the right breast contusion are possibly due to contact with the shoulder belt, but possibly due to contact with the right instrument panel. The right wrist and hand abrasions are possibly due to contact with the right roof side rail and the right thigh abrasions and shin contusions are possibly from contact with the center console. The anterior neck abrasion was from the shoulder belt. The bilateral shoulder abrasions, the bilateral forearm abrasions, the left upper arm abrasions, left ear laceration, and the left knee abrasions are all from an unknown sources.
