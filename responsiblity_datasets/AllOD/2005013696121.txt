The pre-crash movement for this vehicle is successful avoidance; the critical pre-crash event is this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for this event is poor directional control. The driver failed to react in a safe manner to the encroachment of the oncoming vehicle. The driver stated that she overreacted, and that she didn't even think about what she was doing.

The associative factors for this reason are, driver distraction and poor road conditions. The driver stated that she was thinking about what she was going to do when she got home, this paired with the roads being covered in compacted snow, made it so that her reaction to the approaching vehicle was unsafe.
