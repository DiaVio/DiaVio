This crash involved a driver responding to a left side leading, 10-14 quarter-turn, trip-over sequence, down a steep embankment. This single vehicle crash occurred on an east/west, mountainous, two-lane roadway traveling through a rural area. There was one lane for traffic in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. The road had a positive grade and a sweeping left curve from east to west. The north roadside consisted of a paved shoulder followed by a steep upward embankment. The south roadside consisted of a paved shoulder bordered by a mountable curb. Beyond the curb a narrow dirt shoulder gave away to a steep downward embankment. The weather was rainy and the bituminous roadway wet during the afternoon, weekday crash. The case vehicle, a 2004 Nissan Frontier XE king-cab, was traveling westbound. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The 68-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint, air bags did not deploy. The driver entered the left sweeping curve and as he negotiated it the vehicle lost traction and began to "slide to the right". The driver began a series of turning maneuvers to regain stability that resulted in the vehicle traveling off of the south (left) roadside. The vehicle traveled over the edge of the dirt shoulder and its left wheels dug into the downward sloping embankment. The vehicle tripped to the left presumably landing first with its top left roof rail. The vehicle rolled an approximate 10-14 quarter-turns until it came to rest on its top facing southwest with its front against large boulders. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The driver (subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to "A" injury as rated by police.
