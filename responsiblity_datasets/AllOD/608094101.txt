This case involves a severe impact to the front of the case vehicle with the side of a compact pick-up truck. The case occupant is the 35-year-old male right-front passenger who was restrained by a three-point belt and the top instrument-panel, seatback mounted and curtain side impact air bags deployed. The case vehicle a 2006 two-door Honda Civic was in the outside northbound lane of a dry, level concrete divided four-lane traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection. It was dark, but lighted and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 GMC Sonoma 4x2 pick-up truck was in the inside southbound lane approaching the same intersection. As V2 was making a left-turn it entered the path of the case vehicle. The front of the case vehicle struck the right side of V2. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise in the outside northbound lane, out of the intersection, ride over a curb departing the road, traversed a sidewalk, struck a utility pole with its back end before coming to rest in a private drive facing south-southeast. V2 also rotated clockwise as it departed the road at the northeast corner of the intersection, traversed a sidewalk and came to rest in a parking lot facing northwest. Both the 26-year-old male driver and the 35-year-old male right-front passenger of the case vehicle were restrained by a three-point belt. The seatback mounted and curtain side impact air bags on each side of the vehicle deployed. The driver sustained police reported non-incapacitating injuries, but was transported to a level-one trauma center. The right-front passenger sustained critical injuries and was also transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
