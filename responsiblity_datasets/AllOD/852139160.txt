This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions through a curve of a three lane, two way highway with two lanes for eastbound direction. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet 3500 cab-based tow truck was westbound in the curve and crossed the centerline and the front left corner of V1 impacted the front left corner of vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Ford F350 truck traveling eastbound in lane two. V1 then rotated counterclockwise about 100 degrees into the eastbound lane two when the right side fender of V1 was struck by the front left of vehicle three (V3), a 1998 Oldsmobile 88 sedan that was traveling behind V2. V1 then continued to rotate counterclockwise and came to final rest facing west in the eastbound lane two and V3 rotated counterclockwise slightly and came to final rest in eastbound lane one facing northeast. V2 post impact with V1 also rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees and came to final rest in the westbound lane facing west. All vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only person in the vehicle. The driver is a 48 year old male who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and was transported to the trauma center with serious injuries.
