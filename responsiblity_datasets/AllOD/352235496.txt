Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 29-year-old, male driver, of a 2012 Honda Civic 2-door coupe, which was primarily involved in a frontal impact with two, in-line, telephone poles. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours, of a late summer weekday, on a straight and level section, of a two-lane, east/west roadway. The roadway has a speed limit of 40 mph (64 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2012 Honda Civic 2-door coupe, was being operated by the 29-year-old male driver (case occupant), in the eastbound travel lane. He was restrained by his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling eastbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway (south edge) and subsequently struck and sheared the two telephone poles (in-line next to each other) with its frontal plane. Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and subsequently struck a wooden fence post with its right rear corner (minor fascia damage) before coming to rest, facing a northerly direction. As a result of the impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 tried to exit the vehicle under his own power, but fell out the vehicle after he opened the door. He was subsequently transported, by land and air units, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with a moderate injury. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
