This rollover crash involved a 73 year old female driver who was restrained and sustained moderate severity injuries. This rollover crash occurred during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Honda Fit was travelling eastbound on a single lane, one way street that intersected with a four legged intersection with posted stop signs. V1 crossed through this intersection without stopping, and continued in the eastbound lane where the street becomes a two lane, two way roadway with parking lanes bordering both sides. Beyond the intersection V1 drifted to the right and the right front side of V1 hit the back left corner of a parked car. The damage swiped down the right fender and directly impacted the right front tire, which was pushed rearward. V1 then began to rotate clockwise in the eastbound lane and started to rollover to the left. The left side of V1 partially contacted the ground and then V1 landed on its roof top. V1 slid on its roof for a short distance and rotated around facing southwest at final rest, lying partially in the westbound lane. V1 was towed and disabled. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and no one else was in the vehicle. This driver was a 73 year old female and was wearing her manual lap/shoulder belt. No airbags deployed in her position. She self-extricated from V1 and then was transported to the trauma center and hospitalized with moderate severity injuries.
