This case involves a restrained 46 year old female driver in a 2012 Nissan Altima (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual side airbags. The driver's frontal steering wheel mounted airbag, left side curtain, and left outboard seat mounted airbag all deployed during the crash. V2, a 2001 Cadillac DeVille was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was traveling east in the eastbound lane while negotiating a left curve. V2 was traveling west in the westbound lane while negotiating a right curve. While negotiating the curve, V2 drifted left across the center lane line into the path of V1. The front left of V2 contacted the front left of V1. After impact, V1 was pushed rearward while rotating counterclockwise. V1 continued off the roadway into a private drive where it came to rest facing northeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise after impact and came to rest while in the roadway facing south. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage.
