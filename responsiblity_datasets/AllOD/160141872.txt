This frontal-underride crash case involves a 19-year-old restrained female with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injury when her vehicle struck the side of a truck's trailer. The crash occurred at dawn and under dry, clear weather conditions. The crash occurred on a three lane, one way roadway, part of a five lane, two way trafficway. A grass median divides the north and southbound lanes. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2002 Toyota Corolla sedan being driven northbound. Vehicle two (V2) is a 2004 Kenworth medium heavy truck carrying a trailer who was attempting a U-turn from the southbound lanes onto the northbound lanes. The crash occurred when V2 started to make the U-turn. As the trailer of V2 took up all three northbound lanes, V1 struck the right side of the trailer. V1 and V2 both came to rest in the roadway and V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by the 19-year-old case study occupant. She was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt and the available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center by helicopter for treatment.
