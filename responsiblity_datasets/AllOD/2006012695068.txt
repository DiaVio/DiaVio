Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1994 Mazda pick-up was traveling southbound in lane one of the highway. As V1 continued south it began to drift off the right side of the road. V1 departed the roadway on the right side where its front contacted a bridge abutment. V1 rotated clockwise slightly before coming to final rest against the abutment, still off of the roadway.

The driver of V1 was a 44-year old male who reported that he had been traveling between 98-112kmph (61-70mph) prior to the crash. He claimed to be rested as he traveled to work. He stated he felt the back of his truck begin to sway and drift off the road. He took his foot off the accelerator and tried to steer left, but he was unable to return to the highway. He sustained incapacitating injuries and was transported to a local trauma facility. V1 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side.
