The single vehicle, weekday, late afternoon crash occurred off the right side of the 2 one-way, northbound lanes of a bituminous, straight, level, 4-lane interstate roadway at an entrance ramp/interchange area. At the time of the crash it was daylight, clear and the roadway was dry. The posted speed for the roadway was 113 kmh (70mph).

V1, a 2000 Ford Windstar occupied by a 21 year-old female driver, 4 female passengers ages 19, 5, 4, 21months and 1 male passenger age 3, was northbound in lane 2 of the roadway described above. V1 was overtaking a non-contact semi-truck in lane 1 of the same roadway when it suddenly came over into lane 2 to attempt to pass another non-contact vehicle in front of the truck in lane 1. This occurred just as all 3 vehicles were passing an interchange though no vehicles were merging. The driver of v1 braked hard with lockup and v1 then went into a clockwise yaw, crossed over lane one, the merge lane and struck a guardrail with its front. V1 slid sideways, left side leading, and came to rest partially on the shoulder and partially onto the merge lane east-southeast. One of the passengers was transported. V1 was towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of v1 stated that she is a babysitter for the children and had taken them to the zoo for the day. They were on their way home. She stated that she was in lane 2 going about 75mph and was not alongside the truck but almost to the rear of the trailer when it suddenly started coming over into her lane. She braked and the van went into a clockwise skid and she just held on while continuing to brake. She said that the van's front hit a guardrail protecting a bridge support. The airbags did deploy.

The Critical pre-crash event was ”This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side”. The Critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was inadequate evasive action, e.g. braking only, not braking and steering. Some contributing factors for v1 include the driver conversing with other occupants when the NC vehicle came into her lane, her fatigue from being at the zoo all day and her lack of experience with both the road and the vehicle. She had only driven the van a few times and it did not belong to her. It was also a different type of vehicle from the small car she owns and regularly drives.
