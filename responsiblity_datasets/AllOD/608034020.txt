The case vehicle a four-door 1997 Buick Le Sabre was southbound on a dry, level asphalt roadway approaching an off-set four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 2002 Ford Explorer was eastbound on the intersecting roadway. It was dark and there was no adverse weather. As the case vehicle was crossing the intersection, V2 entered its path. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid a collision by braking and steering left. The front of the case vehicle struck the left side of V2. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate approximately 360 degrees before it came to a rest facing south at the southeast corner of the intersection. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise over the mountable curb onto the roadside. Its wheels dug into the ground causing it to trip and rollover four-quarter turns before it came to rest facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 15-year-old female driver was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 42-year-old male right-front passenger was also restrained by a lap and shoulder belt and the mid-instrument panel air bag deployed. The 11-year-old male left-rear passenger was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt. The 13-year-old male right-rear passenger was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt. The driver sustained police reported 'B' injuries and was treated and released from a local hospital. The right-front passenger sustained police reported 'C' injuries and was treated and released from a local hospital. The left-rear passenger was transported to a local hospital with critical injuries and later transferred to a level-one trauma center at a children's hospital. The right-rear passenger was transported to a local hospital with serious injuries and later transferred to a level-one trauma center at a children's hospital.
