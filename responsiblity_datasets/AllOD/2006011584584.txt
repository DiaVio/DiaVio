This crash occurred at dawn of a weekday on a two-way, two-lane, residential roadway. The bituminous roadway was straight and level with a statutory speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph). A light rain was failing at the time of crash, which when combined with the freezing temperatures caused the roads to become ice-covered.

V1, a 1996 Ford Explorer, was eastbound on the roadway. As V1 continued its acceleration it began to slide to the left. The driver steered to the right and then back to the left in an attempt to keep the vehicle on the road. V1 rotated clockwise and as the left side tires of V1 encountered a patch of dry pavement in the road, the Explorer rolled over longitudinally two-quarter turns onto its roof. V1 continued rotating before coming to final rest on its top facing northwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was driven by a belted 48 year-old woman who had just left her home on her way to work. She stated that she was traveling no more than 32kmph (20 mph) when her vehicle began to slide out of control. She also stated she did everything she could to bring the vehicle back under control, but it still rolled over. The driver refused treatment for non-incapacitating injuries and V1 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions-ice. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a driver related factor, a decision error, too fast for conditions (ice). Associated factors for this crash include the slick surface of the roadway due to the icy conditions, as well as the light rain, which was failing at the time of the crash.
