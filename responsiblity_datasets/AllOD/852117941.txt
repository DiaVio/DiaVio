This 81-year-old 163 cm, 68 kg (5 '4 ", 150 lbs.) female case occupant was the front right passenger of a 2001 Buick LeSabre 4-door sedan that was involved in a moderate frontal crash. The case occupant was found to not be restrained with a seat belt and only had a frontal mid-instrument panel air bag deployment. It appears the occupant moved forward on the first impact that involved a 12 o'clock direction of force and was protected by the air bag on this event. The vehicle then continued to roll down a steep downgrade impacting a light pole with the front with another frontal 12 o'clock direction of force. The air bag was found to have blood marks on its left half. Behind this area of the air bag it appeared there was a contact point with the instrument panel as evidenced by the presence of scuff marks. Both knees left scuff marks streaks on the glove box from the movement forward. The case occupant sustained fractures to both maxillary sinuses, nasal bone, right zygoma with mild diastasis of the zygomatico-frontal bone suture, right orbital floor and fractures to the medial wall of both orbits. She also suffered a subcondylar fracture of the right mandible and a dislocated left temporomandibular joint. At the time of the second impact, this unrestrained occupants face likely contacted the instrument panel through the deflated airbag at the time of the second impact. Evidence for this mechanism is given by the presence of blood spattering on the airbag and scuffing of the instrument panel behind the airbag and was rated as probable. There were also significant chest injuries including right 8th and 9th rib fractures; a left 7th rib fracture and left pulmonary contusions and lacerations. These injuries were likely due to her moving forward into the instrument panel at the time of the second impact, once again through the deflated airbag. The evidence for this mechanism was rated as possible and is supported by the presence of scuffmarks on the instrument panel.
