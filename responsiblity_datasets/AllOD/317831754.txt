This case involves an unrestrained 61 year old female driver in a 2010 Hyundai Santa Fe (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The frontal driver's steering wheel mounted airbag, dual side curtains, and dual outboard side airbags deployed during the crash. The crash occurred on the roadside of a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway during the daylight hours. There were not any adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph). Both travel lanes were level. V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane while negotiating a right curve when it drifted right onto the roadside and contacted a pothole with its right front tire. V1 continued over the pothole and crossed a driveway. The driver of V1 steered left in an attempt to maneuver her vehicle back onto the roadway. V1 re-entered the roadway and crossed both lanes. V1 then departed the roadway onto the left roadside. While on the roadside V1 contacted an embankment. As V1 slowed as it reached the top of the embankment. The slope of the embankment then caused V1 to rollover with its right side leading. V1 rolled four quarter turns while falling down the embankment. It then came to rest on its wheels as it re-entered the northbound lane facing southeast. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver was transported from the crash scene and taken to a level one trauma center. She was treated for severe injuries that she sustained in the crash.
