This single vehicle rollover crash occurred at night with no street lights on a two lane, two way blacktop road that had a curve. The weather was clear with dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chrysler Sebring four door sedan was southbound on this road and began to negotiate the curve to the left. The right tires of V1 went slightly off the west road edge and then V1 returned to the roadway and began to rotate counterclockwise across the southbound and the northbound lanes. V1 then departed the roadway to the left and the front of V1 dropped into the ditch just as V1 was rotated about 90 degrees. The front overhang undercarriage of V1 impacted the gravel and dirt in the ditch as the right rear tire and rim began to gouge into the pavement in the northbound lane. V1 then began to rollover to the right one quarter turn and departed the roadway completely. The top impacted both a chain link fence and top front left corner scraped a tree before the top greenhouse of V1 impacted a large tree. V1 bowed around this large tree and the top hood impacted another tree. V1 then came to final rest on its right side and wrapped around the large tree and then a fire began in the engine compartment that was extinguished. V1 had to be towed due to damage. The occupants in V1 included a driver, front right passenger and second seat right passenger. The front right passenger of V1 is the case occupant who was a 25 year old male wearing a manual lap and shoulder belt and the instrument panel mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant was airlifted to the trauma center and sustained serious injuries. The driver a 25 year old male was fatally injured who was belted with the steering column airbag and the roof rail side curtain air bag deployments. The second seat right passenger was belted and was transported to the trauma center with only minor injuries.
