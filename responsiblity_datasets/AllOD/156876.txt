Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Suzuki SX4, 4-door hatchback was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. The driver of V1 was negotiating a right curve and approaching a controlled 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford E450 straight truck/ambulance was traveling north in the northbound through-lane of the intersecting four-lane, two-way road (one southbound lane, one northbound left-turn lane, one northbound through-lane, and one northbound right-turn lane) with its lights and sirens running. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road surface was wet. As V2 approached the intersection, the driver moved into the left-turn lane to avoid stopped and yielding traffic and then proceeded into the intersection. The driver of V1 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in an L-type configuration. The impact redirected V2 toward the northeast corner while V1 rapidly rotated in a counterclockwise manner and the right side of V1 struck the left side of V2 in a side-slap type configuration. V2 came to a controlled stop on the east shoulder, north of the intersection, facing north-northeast. V1 came to rest in the middle of the road, north of the intersection facing north-northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 47-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
