The case occupant is a 56 year old front right female passenger, wearing an integrated manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a severe rollover crash. She sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during the late evening hours in the eastbound lanes of a four lane, divided highway with unprotected median. In the area where the crash occurred, the two eastbound lanes curve to the right, are comprised of concrete and are level. To the north of the eastbound lanes is a narrow paved shoulder, followed by a sloped gravel and grassy median that separates the two eastbound lanes from the two westbound lanes. At the time of the crash the weather was clear with dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 GMC Sierra K2500 Heavy Duty Duramax diesel two door large pickup, was traveling east in lane two. V1 then departed the roadway to the left into the median and began to rotate clockwise. V1's left tires dug into the soft gravel, causing V1 to trip and begin rolling over to the left. V1 completed eight quarter turns before coming to final rest on its tires in the median, facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the front right passenger in V1, a 56 year old female who was wearing the available integrated manual lap/shoulder belt. Evidence on the outer right front door panel and window frame indicates that this case occupant was partially ejected out the front right window during the crash. She sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver, seated in the front left seat, was a 58 year old male who was restrained with the available integrated manual lap/shoulder belt. He sustained minor injuries and his medical treatment status is unknown. There were no air bag deployments during the crash.
