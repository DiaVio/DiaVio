Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chrysler Town & Country minivan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a four-lane, two-way road (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound). For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 relinquished control of the vehicle and V1 drifted to the right. V1 ran off the right side of the road and sideswiped a guardrail, then continued across a gore area and several freeway on/off ramps before striking a utility pole with the center front bumper. A device or cable then fell from the utility pole striking the top of V1. V1 came to rest against the pole facing north-northeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 37-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel and knee bolster air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries. The 5-year-old female second row left passenger (case occupant) was seated in a forward facing child seat that was secured to the vehicle using the LATCH system. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries. 5-year-old female second row right passenger was seated in a forward facing child seat that was secured to the vehicle using the LATCH system. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries. The 9 year-old male third-row right passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries.
