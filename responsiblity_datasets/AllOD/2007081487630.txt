This single-vehicle crash occurred a few hours past noon during daylight. The location was a rural residential roadway that was a two-way with two-lanes. The roadway was a 90 degree curve to the right with a 7% uphill grade in the northbound direction of travel. The weather was clear and dry. The posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).

Vehicle one (V1) was a 2003 Ford F-150 4-door pickup driven by a seventy eight year old male V1 was traveling northbound up a hill negotiating a curve to the right to head eastbound. All of the sudden there was a large school bus coming the opposite direction partially in his lane. The driver of V1 steered to the right to avoid contacting the school bus. V1 departed the right side of the roadway then started to bounce up & down in a drainage ditch. V1's bouncing caused the driver to hit the accelerator harder, and the undercarriage of his vehicle bottomed out as the ditch ended at a driveway. V1 then came up out of the ditch and hit some garbage cans in the driveway. V1 traveled across the driveway and into a second drainage ditch. V1's undercarriage then impacted the side of the drainage ditch as V1 came up out of that ditch. V1 then ran straight into a large tree with the right front corner. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
