Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder SUV, was traveling north in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions while negotiating a curve to the right. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford F-350 Pickup, was traveling south on the same roadway stopped in its lane preparing to make a left turn into a driveway. V1 crossed the center line and the left front of V1 contacted the left front of V2. V2 came to final rest in-between the two lanes. This impact caused V1 to depart the roadway to its right, entering a counterclockwise rotation. V1 then struck an iron fence with its front, knocking the fence down. V1 then continued its counterclockwise rotation for about eighty degrees before striking a tree with its right side. V1 came to final rest after striking the tree. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 62 year old male and case study occupant, was not wearing the three-point lap and shoulder belt. The frontal airbags did not deploy in V1 but the right side, seat mounted head and thorax side bag deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment. The driver of V2 was uninjured and was not treated.
