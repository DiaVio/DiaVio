This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 63-year-old male belted right front passenger with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant sustained serious injuries in a front left corner impact followed by a near side impact. The case vehicle was an intermediate size sedan that sustained moderate damage when it was struck first on the front by a minivan followed by a right plane impact with a large pickup truck. The crash occurred early afternoon in clear weather on a dry road. A 2009 Acura TSX intermediate sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling southeast on a suburban bituminous two-lane, two-way road. V1 was approaching a hillcrest. A 2005 Chrysler Town & Country minivan (Vehicle 2) and a 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 large pickup (Vehicle 3) were traveling northwest approaching the same hillcrest. V2 crossed the center line at the peak of the hillcrest and struck the front of V1 in a small overlap configuration (Event 1). The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise eighty degrees and travel into the oncoming lane of travel. The front of V3 then impacted the right plane of V1 (Event 2). All three vehicles came to rest on the northeast shoulder and were towed due to damage. The right front seat of V1 was occupied by a 63-year-old male case occupant. He was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The top instrument panel, curtain, and side seatback airbags deployed. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance where he was later transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 56-year-old female belted driver. Her available front and side airbags also deployed. She suffered police-reported incapacitating injuries and was transported to a local hospital.
