This two vehicle daytime collision occurred mid-afternoon during daylight hours. The collision occurred at the uncontrolled intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The pre-crash roadway is level worn concrete paving. The east/west roadway is a 10% grade up to the intersection. Both roadways are non-divided two lane road and have non-posted speed limits of 40 kmph (25 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1982 Honda Accord sedan, driven by a 42 year-old male was traveling southbound in lane 1. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Nissan Murano compact sport utility, driven by a 47 year-old male was traveling eastbound in lane 1. Both vehicles approached the intersection at roughly the same time, and the front of V2 collided with the left side of V1. Both vehicles deflected from the contacted corners, side slapped and came to rest in the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage, V2 was driven from the scene. The driver of V2 stated that he didn't see V1 until the crash was imminent. The driver of V1 stated that he had enough time to steer right and hit the brakes, but was not able to avoid the crash. V2 had a mostly obscured sight line to V1 by tall bushes along the right side of the roadway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection. The critical reason for the critical event is not coded to this vehicle.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V2 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).

Additional factor- possible sight-line restriction from bushes and trees,
