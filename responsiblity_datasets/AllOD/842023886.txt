This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 50 year old female driver of a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4 sport utility. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree (event 1). Vehicle 1 was westbound on a (level) two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. It was dark (roadway not lighted), with cloudy/rainy weather conditions. Vehicle 1 broke traction on the wet pavement and began to travel towards the left (south) pavement edge in a counterclockwise yaw. Vehicle 1 entered a private yard, as the front right area subsequently impacted a large diameter tree. The initial impact resulted in moderate damage. The vehicle's pre-impact side-slip angle, and offset frontal impact configuration, compounded the counterclockwise rotation off the struck tree. A roll moment was induced as the vehicle's center of gravity was tipped outboard of its wheels. This initiated a 3-quarter turn right side rollover ("bounce-over"), which resulted in minor top damage (event 2). Vehicle 1 came to rest on its left side (off the south pavement edge) facing north. The 50 year old female driver of the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee was unrestrained with the seat adjusted to a mid-track position. The lack of restraint use was evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system, relative to the concentration of contacts identified across the front occupant space. At impact 1, the driver initiated a forward (and slightly lateral) trajectory in response to the 1 o'clock impact force and loaded the knee bolster and deployed driver frontal airbag. Scuff marks were documented on the left knee bolster. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal airbag was evidenced by the makeup transfers identified across the face of the membrane. Driver loading continued into the center console, gearshift, and center instrument panel, as evidenced by the lateral displacement noted on these components. The subsequent rollover compounded the kinematic trajectory further into the front right occupant space (quarter turns 1 & 2). A lipstick transfer was documented on the face of the passenger airbag. The front seat backs were deformed rearward, and possibly attributed to driver rebound just prior to vehicle final rest (quarter turn 3). Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and admitted for treatment. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
