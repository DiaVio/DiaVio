Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Dodge Neon, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Dodge Neon, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right-side of V1 in a T-type configuration. After impact, V2 rotated clockwise approximately 50 degrees and came to rest in the northbound lane, on the south leg of the intersection, facing south-southeast. V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 40 degree and departed the road at the southeast corner of the intersection. V1 continued in a south-easterly direction, vaulted partially across a drainage ditch, striking the undercarriage on the far-side of the ditch before coming to rest in an agricultural field facing south-southeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 29-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The 19-year-old female right-front passenger (non-case occupant) was also transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital where she was treated and released with minor (AIS-1, ISS-1) injuries.
