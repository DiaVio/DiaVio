This single vehicle crash occurred during early evening daylight hours on a two lane, round-a-bout, in the center of a four-leg intersection with yield signs at all four legs. Vehicle one (V1) entered the round-a-bout heading southbound in lane one of a physically divided, four-lane roadway. The roadway runs north and south at the location of the crash and consists of two lanes in each direction and two, one-way lanes at the round-a-bout. V1 was leaving the round-a-bout and heading south in lane one. The speed limit is 64 kmph (40 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear, but it was dusk.

V1, a 1999 Chevrolet Corvette, was southbound in lane one leaving the round-a-bout. The driver, a 40 year old male, was traveling at a police reported speed of 89 kmph (55 mph) when the driver lost control of V1. V1 departed the right side of the road, impacted a curb with its right rear tire, entered a clockwise rotation, again impacted the curb with its right side, rode up over the curb and began to rotate counterclockwise. V1 then impacted a wooden fence with its right side, impacted a sign with its front, re-entered the roadway and came to rest on its wheels facing generally south in the number one lane. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The driver stated that he had worked long and hard and was somewhat fatigued. Also, it was dusk so the reduced light conditions may have been a factor.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the right side of travel lane. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn.
