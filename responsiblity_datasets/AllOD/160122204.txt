Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2004 Ford Explorer, four-door (case study vehicle). V1 was occupied by a male, age 30 as its driver and lone occupant. V1's occupant was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and the frontal airbags deployed as a result of impact. The crash occurred during the hours of daylight. The weather at the time of the crash was clear and dry. The roadway surface was dry. The speed limit is not posted. The crash occurred at a T intersection on a two lane, two way roadway.. The roadway is level in the area of the crash. V1 came to the end of the roadway at a T intersection and departed the roadway, driving through a raised concrete curb (event 1) and a uphill grass embankment before striking another curb and entering a parking lot (event 2). V1 then struck a parked 2001 Chrysler Sebring (event 3). V1 then continued straight, striking a raised concrete curb with its left front tire (event 4) and then its left rear tire (event 5). Event four caused the left front tire to be ripped from the axle. V1 continued on past the curb and struck a tree head-on (event 6). V1 continued for a few meters until it struck a chain-link fence pole (event 7), where it came to final rest. The case study participant was transported by air to a trauma center.
