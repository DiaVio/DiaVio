The case occupant is a 38 year old female driver who was involved in a severe head on collision with another vehicle. This driver was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her frontal air bag deployed and she sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred at dusk, during clear weather and dry roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of one east and one westbound asphalt travel lane. The eastbound lane has a downhill grade, is straight for a section, then curves to the right. For westbound vehicles there is an uphill grade with a curve to the left. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Mazda 6 four door sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Nissan Altima four door sedan, was traveling east in the eastbound lane. As V2 entered the curved section of roadway, it traveled across the center lane lines and into V1's lane of travel. V1's front struck the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's driver side frontal air bag. V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest partially off the roadway, facing north. V2 came to final rest facing northeast, near V1. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 38 year old female driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's retractor pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There was a two year old female occupant seated in an unknown type of child safety seat in the second row right seating position. The police and driver of V1 reported that this child was not injured in the crash.
