This case focuses on a restrained 51 year old female driver in a 2014 Toyota Highlander (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual first row side airbags, dual side curtains (first, second, and third rows). The frontal steering wheel mounted airbag, driver's knee bolster airbag, side airbags, and side curtains all deployed during the crash. The crash occurred on a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway during the daylight hours on a clear day. The posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph). V1 was traveling west in the westbound lane of the two-way roadway. V1 drifted off the roadway onto the right roadside where its right side contacted tree limbs. V1 continued on the roadside traveling west. The driver noticed her vehicle off the roadway and began to steer left and brake in an attempt to maneuver her vehicle back into its original travel lane. V1 went left across the roadway and departed the roadway onto the left roadside where its lower frontal plane contacted a large culvert. V1 continued a short distance and came to rest on the culvert facing southwest. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by ground ambulance. She was treated for moderate injuries that she sustained in the crash.
