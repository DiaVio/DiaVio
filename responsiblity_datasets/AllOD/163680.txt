Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Volkswagen GTI, 2-door hatchback was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way residential road. It was dark, the street lights were illuminated, the weather was cloudy, and the asphalt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 was traveling uphill and entering a left curve. The driver entered the curve with too much speed and he was unable to keep V1 from departing the right side of the road. The right-front of V1 struck a 25-cm diameter tree and V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately thirty degrees and came to rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 27-year-old male driver was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
