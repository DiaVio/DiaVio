This two-vehicle crash occurred during mid-morning daylight hours at an intersection controlled by a tri-light signal on colors. The roadway consists of two southbound lanes, two northbound lanes and a left turn lane. The roadway was dry, level, asphalt and undivided. The speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle one (V1) was a 1997 Ford Taurus GL 4-door sedan driven by a 53 year-old male. Vehicle two (V2) was a 2005 Freight liner business class M2 straight truck. Both vehicles were traveling south in the number one lane at unknown speeds. V2 stopped for the red light but the driver of V1 assumed he was going to continue forward which resulted in V1 impacting the rear of V2 with its front plane. Both vehicles came to rest at impact. V1 was towed from the scene, V2 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: false assumption of other's actions. Associative factor: V1's driver has a myopic eye condition, but was not wearing his corrective lenses at the time of the crash. He was wearing over the counter sunglasses instead.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
