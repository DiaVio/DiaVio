Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 pickup truck, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane roadway, part of a five lane, divided trafficway. V1 was traveling under snowy, icy conditions. V1 drove over ice and started rotating clockwise. The driver of V1 then steered left and the vehicle then started skidding counterclockwise. V1 crossed over both lanes of the roadway while skidding counterclockwise and the right front and then right rear tires then struck the curb of the median. V1 came to final rest in the grass median but was still driveable. The driver of V1, a 76-year-old male and case study occupant, was unrestrained and had no air bags deploy during impact. The driver of V1 drove his truck home post-crash and went to a local hospital for treatment several hours later.
