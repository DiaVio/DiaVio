The case vehicle, a 1997 Dodge Caravan mini-van, was southbound and stopped on a two-lane divided roadway, waiting to make a left turn onto a two-lane highway. Vehicle two (V2) a 1998 Dodge Ram 2500 Club Cab 4x4 was northbound stopped in the mouth of a private drive, waiting to make a right turn onto the same highway. As V2 completed its right turn - heading east, the case vehicle was in the middle of its' left turn - heading east. The front of the case vehicle struck the left fender of V2. The impact caused the case vehicle to veer sharply left before it came to rest straddling the west-bound lane and the north shoulder. V2 veered right and came to a rest on the south shoulder.

The case occupant is the restrained 60-year-old female driver. Her steering-wheel airbag deployed as a result of the impact with V2. She was the sole occupant of the vehicle. She was transported to a local hospital, prior to being transferred to a level-one trauma center.
