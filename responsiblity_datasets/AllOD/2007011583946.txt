The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a 2-lane, 2-way, straight, bituminous, semi-rural, snow covered roadway. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). At the time of the weekday morning crash, traffic was heavy, it was snowing, and it was not yet daylight.

V1, a 2006 Dodge Ram pickup truck solely occupied by the 37-year old male driver, was southbound in lane 1. V2, a 1999 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer solely occupied by the 57-year old female driver, was northbound in lane 1. The driver of V1 lost control and V1 crossed the centerline in a counterclockwise yaw. The driver of V1 steered right and braked, bringing V1 back to the right in a clockwise yaw, still in the northbound lane. The front of V1 contacted the front right of V2. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest off the east side of the road facing north. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest partially on the southbound shoulder facing northwest. The driver of V2 was injured and transported. Both vehicles were towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 stated that he was going about 30-35 mph on his way to work. Even though the vehicle was equipped with 4-wheel drive he did not have it engaged. He said he hit a slick spot and the truck swerved across the centerline. He then tried to correct the skid and re-enter his own lane. He said he was not late but that he goes to this particular facility for his job only about 6 times a year.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was the decision error of driving too fast for conditions. Some associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include the driver's speed, his driving on an unfamiliar roadway, the blowing snow, and the snow covered roadway.

The driver of V2 stated that she was on her way to work on the route that she takes daily, was not late for work and was in fact driving slow enough that she thought she was actually holding up the northbound rush hour traffic. She saw V1 lose control and enter her lane. She started braking and thought V1 was going to slide off the east side of the road. She decided against trying to steer away from it as there was oncoming traffic in the southbound lanes and if she steered right she thought she would hit V1. She stayed in her lane and was surprised that V1 was in her lane trying to return to the southbound lane. The driver of V2 felt the impact and then let go of the wheel and just let her vehicle go to its final rest.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over left lane line." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to V2 include the slick roadway and the weather (snow).
