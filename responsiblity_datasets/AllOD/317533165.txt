This case focuses on a restrained 16-year-old female driver, restrained 17-year-old female center rear passenger, and a restrained 14-year-old female right rear passenger in a 2006 Nissan Altima four door sedan (V1). There was also a restrained right front female passenger and an unrestrained left rear passenger in V1. V1 was equipped with dual frontal air bags that both deployed during the crash. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 2006 Jeep Liberty utility vehicle (V2). The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a two-way, two-lane, dry, and asphalt road in a no passing zone. The speed limit for both vehicles was 56 kph (35 mph). V1 was traveling north in the northbound lane of the roadway. V2 was traveling south in the southbound lane of the roadway. V2 crossed the center lane line causing the two vehicles to collide head-on. V1 was pushed rearward and came to rest facing north while in the northbound lane. V2 continued left while rotating clockwise and departed the road onto the left roadside where it came to rest facing west. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver in V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by air and received treatment for moderate injuries that she sustained. The restrained center rear passenger also received moderate injuries and was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center. The right rear passenger had serious injuries and was also transported to a level one trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment.
