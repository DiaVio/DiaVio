This single vehicle crash involved a front left corner impact into a tree off road and occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Subaru Outback wagon was southbound on a two lane, two way road with an upgrade. V1 drove off the road to the right into a grassy ditch and the front right corner swiped a fire hydrant. This damage continued to swipe down the whole right side of the V1. V1 then continued up an embankment and enter a group of evergreen trees and the top hood, windshield and roof impacted a large overhanging branch before the front left corner of V1 impacted a large tree. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise post impact with this tree and the right side impacted a wooden fence where it came to final rest. V1 was damaged and towed. The driver is the case occupant and the only person in V1. The driver is a 53 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the pre-tensioner activated and the frontal steering column air bag deployed. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center.
