This case focuses on a restrained 80 years old male driver in a 2012 Honda Civic (V1). V1 was equipped with dual side curtains, dual frontal airbags, and dual first row side airbags. The driver's frontal steering mounted airbag along with the right side curtain deployed during the crash. V2, a 2010 Chrysler Town and Country minivan was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a curved, two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 45 mph (72 kph). V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane while negotiating a left hand curve. V2 was traveling north in the northbound lane while negotiating a right hand curve. V2 drifted across the center lane line into oncoming traffic. While in the opposing lane, the front of V2 contacted the front of V1 in an offset right frontal type impact. V1 was pushed rearward while rotating clockwise. V1 traveled across the center lane line onto the left roadside where its rear contacted shrubbery. V1 came to rest on the roadside facing southwest. After impact with V1, V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest on the roadside adjacent to the southbound lane, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by ground ambulance. He was treated for serious injuries that he sustained in the crash.
