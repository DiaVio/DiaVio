This case study involved the belted female driver of a passenger car responding to a frontal impact with a concrete barrier. The collision, with a twelve o'clock principal direction of force acting on the vehicle, caused moderate damage. The subject's frontal-impact air bag deployed. The subject sustained a serious lower leg injury. This crash occurred on the westbound side of a six-lane interstate. There were three lanes for travel in each direction divided by a concrete barrier approximately one meter tall. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the night-time (dark-not lit), weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2006 Toyota Corolla, 4-door sedan) was traveling westbound in the number-one lane. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts (first row pretensioner equipped) and first row frontal-impact air bags. The eighteen year old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, based on the condition found. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1997 Plymouth Voyager, minivan) was traveling westbound in the number-three lane. As the driver of V1 (case subject) approached an overpass she steered to the right, possibly reacting to reflecting lights, until the vehicle traveled off onto the right shoulder. Alarmed, the driver steered to the left and the vehicle began a counterclockwise yaw as it traveled across the lanes and into the concrete, center divider barrier. The front of V1 struck the barrier in a twelve o'clock principal direction of force impact, causing the subject's frontal-impact air bag to deploy and the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise more rapidly, as it rebounded off of the barrier. V1 came to rest facing southeast across the number-three lane. There were other vehicles slowing, pulling around her and stopping, as the subject began to open her door and attempt to exit. She noticed another vehicle approaching, also westbound in the number-three lane. She settled back against her seat when the front of V2 struck the left plane of V1 forward of the front axle. This nine o'clock principal direction of force impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise rapidly, approximately 100-degrees. V2 was deflected to the left and as the vehicles rotated away from each other the left door of V1 was struck by the right side of V2, in a minor 'side-slap' type impact. V1 came rest facing northwest in the number-three lane. V2 struck the center divider and came to rest facing west on the shoulder. Both vehicles were towed from the scene, V1 due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver of V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to a serious lower leg injury.
