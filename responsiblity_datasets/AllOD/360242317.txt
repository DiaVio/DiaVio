This moderate severity frontal crash involved a restrained 40 year old female driver who sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. This driveway access crash occurred during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan, was traveling southbound on a two lane, two way roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford Ranger pickup truck, was northbound on the same roadway. Vehicle three (V3), a 1988 Peterbilt medium/heavy truck, was parked southbound off the roadway in a parking area adjacent to the southbound lane and just south of a business driveway. V2 began to make a left turn into the driveway just behind V3 and V2's front left impacted the front left of V1. V2 then rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees, as V1 traveled in a southwesterly direction. During V2's rotation, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 was then forced laterally into V3 and the right side of V1 impacted the left side of V3, resulting in minor damage. V1 came to final rest facing south against V3. V2 came to final rest facing west in the southbound lane near V1. V3 remained at its stopped position. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1 who was 40 year old female. She was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and her frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed during the initial frontal impact. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
