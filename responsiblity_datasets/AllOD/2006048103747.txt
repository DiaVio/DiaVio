This single vehicle crash occurred in mid afternoon in the eastbound lanes of a four-lane bituminous, median divided, slight upgrade (1.6%) roadway that curves to the right. The radius of this curve was 285m and it has a super elevation of 2%(-2/122cm). The roadway runs east to west with two travel lanes devoted to each direction. This roadway has a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65mph) and no traffic control devices were present. The crash occurred during a rainstorm. The driver stated the windshield wipers were on medium at the time. Inspection of the scene did not indicate any roadway design or maintenance deficiencies.

Vehicle one, a dark blue 2005 Chevrolet Yukon was traveling westbound in lane one. The driver of vehicle one was a 22-year-old male. The driver was traveling back to his apartment after spending the day at his parents' home out of town. He stated that he was under stress at the time of the crash because his apartment had flooded the day before the crash, his mother was involved in a crash the previous week and he was scheduled to begin a new job on the day following the crash. The driver stated that he was traveling in lane one with his cruise control set on approximately 97 kmph (60 mph), when his vehicle hydroplaned in the standing water and he lost control of the vehicle and departed the roadway to the right. Vehicle one then began a counter-clockwise yaw and rolled upon its longitudinal axis towards its right. Vehicle one rolled 5-quarter turns and came to rest on its right side facing south. Police Reported Travel Speed is 121 kmph for V1.

The critical event for this crash was coded this vehicle traveling-off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason was coded poor direction control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected). Also, the driver's high level of stress was taken into consideration in coding this case.
