Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle) a 2004 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the center turn-lane of a five-lane, two-way urban roadway and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500, crew cab pickup was traveling south in the left southbound lane of the same five-lane roadway. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the concrete road surface was dry. As the driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, the driver of V2 also entered the intersection and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in an angled T-type configuration. Both vehicles departed the road at the south-west corner and the right fender of V1 struck the right fender of V2 as they came to rest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 52 -year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was tranported via ground ambulance to a local hospital where she was admitted for one day with minor injuries. The 53-year-old male right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with severe injuries.
