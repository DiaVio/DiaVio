This two vehicle daytime mid-afternoon collision occurred at a four leg intersection comprised by a north/south roadway and an east/west roadway. The west leg of the intersection is a two-lane, undivided, dry, level, asphalt, private driveway. The east leg of the intersection is a four-lane, dry, level, asphalt, roadway leading into a public transit parking lot. The north/south roadway is undivided, dry, level, asphalt, and consists of six lanes. The north/south roadway is designated a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone. The intersection is controlled by on-color signals that were working properly at the time of the collision. The west leg driveway also has a stop sign.

Vehicle one (V1) is a 1994 Ford Tempo, four-door sedan, driven by a eighty six (86) year old male who was traveling southbound in the number two lane. Vehicle two (V2) is a 2001 Suzuki, sport utility vehicle, driven by a fifty five (55) year old female was traveling westbound in the number one lane. As V2 made a left-turn unto the roadway, its left plane was contacted by the front plane of V1. V1 came to rest facing southeast in the intersection. V2 came to rest facing northwest, blocking the northbound number one and two lanes. V1 received moderate damage and was towed from the scene. V2 received moderate damage and was not towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 failed to realize that a red phase on-color existed at the intersection and did not see that V2 had entered the intersection. Associated factors include the driver's overall health, which includes arthritis in the right leg. The medication by the driver was described as unknown "happy pills" that made him "feel good" all over, they make him feel "strong and young." The medical report states that the driver takes Clopidogral (Plavix) Terazosin for high blood pressure, Atenolol, Imipramine for depression, Lovastatin for high cholesterol, and Fluocimonide for itchy and dry skin. He was on an errand from home to pick up medications at a nearby clinic. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. Inadequate surveillance was coded as an associative factor for this driver for failure to recognize the traffic control.

The driver of V2 was listening to the radio. She had just left a meeting at her company's headquarters and on her way back to her office when the crash occurred. She takes an unspecified medication for a thyroid problem. She caught glimpse of V1 from her peripheral view as it struck her vehicle while she was turning left at the intersection. Although she had the right of way, she turned into the path of V1, which was traveling in a straight path through the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). An associated factor was a false assumption that other driver's would yield the right of way to her vehicle.
