This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a four-way residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a two-lane north/south roadway intersected by a two-lane east/west roadway with all direction being controlled by stop signs. Both roadways were bituminous, dry, straight, and level. The posted speed limit for the east/west direction was 64 kmph (40 mph), while the posted speed limit for the north/south roadway was 56 kmph (35 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Econoline van with one occupant, was northbound on the roadway approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Chrysler Town and Country minivan with two occupants, was stopped facing east at the intersection preparing to continue straight. As V2 entered the intersection it was struck on the right front corner by the front of V1, which had failed to stop for its stop sign. The impact caused V2 to rotate counter-clockwise and strike a curb and a telephone pole before coming to final rest partially on a road island designated for westbound traffic. After the impact, V1 rotated clockwise before coming to final rest in the northbound lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a 20-year-old male, was uninjured in the crash. The driver was advised by his father not to participate in the interview. It is therefore unknown if any fatigue or health related factors contributed to this crash. Physical evidence at the scene however, does suggest that the driver attempted to brake prior to striking V2.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded, this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason was coded as an unknown driver error. The only known associated factor that could be coded was an illegal maneuver, failure to stop for a traffic control device.

The driver of V2, a 74 year-old female, suffered unknown injuries as a result of the crash and was transported to a medical facility for treatment. The other occupant located in the right front passenger seat that also suffered unknown injuries and was transported for treatment. The driver was on her way to the hospital to visit a patient and was familiar with the area and even described her surroundings. She claimed to be at a complete stop for a considerable amount of time and looked both ways before entering the intersection. As she proceeded, she was struck on the right front passenger side of her vehicle. After the impact she hit a telephone pole with the left side of her vehicle.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, across path. The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. The only associated factor was a recognition error as the driver looked but did not see V1 approaching.
