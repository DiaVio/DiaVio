Vehicle One (V1), a 2001 Lexus IS300 sedan, was traveling east in lane two of a four lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle Two (V2), a 1993 Toyota Camry sedan, was traveling west in lane three of the same roadway. For unknown reasons, V1 crossed the centerline and the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway.

Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 57-year old female, was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal air bags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
