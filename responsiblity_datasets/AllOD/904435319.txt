This frontal crash case involves a 29 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with deployed frontal and left side curtain air bags who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Dodge Nitro compact utility vehicle, was northbound in lane one of a two lane, two way asphalt roadway with no curbs present on either side. In V1's precrash area the northbound lane curves to the left with a level grade. V1 was negotiating the left curve when it departed the roadway to the right. V1 traveled across a private residential driveway and then V1's front left sideswiped a wood fence, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued a short distance and its front impacted a large tree, resulting in the actuation of the left front seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the driver's frontal and side curtain air bags. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest facing northwest near the tree. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 29 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag and left roof side rail mounted curtain both deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital, prior to being transferred to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
