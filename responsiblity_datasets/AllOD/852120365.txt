This crash occurred when it was dark with no streetlights on a two lane, two way street that curved left and then right. The weather was clear, and the roadway was dry. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Saab 2.3T station wagon, was traveling eastbound on this roadway that curved to the left. The right tires went off the roadway slightly before V1 returned to the eastbound lane and then left a long tire mark with the right tires across the travel lane and the opposite travel lane before departing the roadway to the left. V1 then tilted slightly to the left as it entered the embankment of the ditch. The undercarriage then struck a tree stump before the front and hood of V1 impacted a large tree. With V1 tilted to the left the tree impact started at the front left corner and angled across the hood to the mid point of the windshield header. With the severe extent of the damage and passenger compartment intrusion rearward, a 12 o'clock direction of force into the tree was assigned but some slight pitch of the vehicle may have cause this impact to be slightly non-horizontal. The impact then rotated V1 counterclockwise 90 degrees as it came to final rest south of the tree. The case vehicle was severely damaged and towed. The three occupants in this vehicle are all case occupants that included the driver, front right passenger and a second seat right passenger. The driver is an 18-year-old male who was wearing the lap and shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed had severe injuries. The front right passenger was an 18-year-old male who was wearing lap and shoulder belt with a frontal instrument panel mounted air bag deployment had serious injuries. The second seat right passenger was an 18-year-old male who was wearing the lap and shoulder belt only had serious injuries. All three case occupants were transported to the trauma center.
