This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 65-year-old female belted driver with deployed front and side airbags. This case occupant was driving a compact sedan when it was involved in a small overlap frontal collision with a minivan, incurring severe damage. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred midafternoon on a dry road in clear conditions. A 2009 Volkswagen Jetta compact sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling south on a bituminous two-lane suburban road. A 2011 Dodge Grand Caravan minivan (Vehicle 2) was traveling north in the opposite direction of the same road. The road grade was level for both approaches. There were no traffic controls for either vehicle. V1 crossed the center-line and struck the front of V2 head-on in a small overlap configuration (Event 1). Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise after impact. V1 was pushed back in its direction of travel before coming to rest on the west shoulder. V2 traveled off the east shoulder and its back plane struck a utility pole (Event 2) before coming to rest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 65-year-old female driver. She was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by 12 cm of shoulder belt payout. The retractor pretensioner was actuated. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The steering wheel hub, left curtain, and left outboard seatback airbags deployed in the crash. The available right instrument panel, right curtain, and right outboard seatback airbags did not deploy. There were no other airbags installed in this vehicle. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. No other occupants were in the vehicle.
