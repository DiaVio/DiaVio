The crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The north/south roadway is five lanes/two way. The east/west roadway is six lanes/two way. One road went east and west with a posted speed of 80kmph (50 mph), and one went north and south with a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). Both were straight, level, bituminous roadways with a level grade. It was night on a weekend and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic was light. The traffic signal went from colors to flashing late in the evening and then returned back to colors early in the morning.

V1, a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero four door with one occupant, was traveling south in lane three approaching the intersection. V2, a 2000 Pontiac four door with three occupants was traveling westbound in lane two, also approaching the intersection. V1 had a blinking red light. V2 had a blinking yellow light. V1 stopped at the light for an unknown amount of time and then proceeded to make her left-turn. She stated that she did not see V2 prior to initiating the turn. V2 stated that he saw V1 as it stopped at the intersection and thought that V1 would yield the right-of-way. V1 and V2 attempted to apply the brakes and avoid each other but could not. The front of V2 contacted the left of V1 before they both came to final rest in the intersection. V2 then backed-up, turned around, and pulled into a commercial driveway so he would not be in the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 was a 22-year old female who reported minor injuries, but refused treatment. She stated that she had just left her house and was on her way to her boyfriend's. She advised that she had stopped at the light for an unknown amount of time. She then proceeded traveling between 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph). She saw V2 as she was turning and applied the brakes but could not avoid him.

The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V1 was: "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection". The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a driver related error: "inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see)" because the driver stated that she did not see V2 prior to when she initiated the turn. An associated factor for the driver of V1 was inadequate surveillance: failed to look to side.

The driver of V2 was a 40-year old male who reported no injuries and refused treatment. He stated that he and his children had just left the movies and was on their way home. He stated that he had been traveling between 67-80 kmph (41-50 mph) prior to V1 turning in front of him. He attempted to apply the brakes but could not avoid V1.

The Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was: "Other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction". The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. An associated factor for the driver of V2 was a false assumption that V1 would yield the right-of-way.
