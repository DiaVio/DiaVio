This three-vehicle crash occurred during late afternoon daylight hours in the westbound lanes of an expressway that has four lanes in each direction which are divided by a concrete jersey barrier. All vehicles were westbound in the number four lane. The area of the crash is a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear, the roads were dry, and there were no sight restrictions or road defects. Traffic was typical moderate rush hour congestion.

Vehicle one (V 1), a 2003 Hyundai Tiburon two door driven by a 25 year-old male was westbound in lane four. Vehicle two (V 2), a 1996 Nissan Sentra 200SX four door driven by a 65 year-old female was westbound ahead of V 1 and Vehicle three (V 3), a 2002 Chrysler Sebring convertible driven by a 35 year-old female was westbound ahead of V 2. V 2 and V 3 slowed, then stopped for traffic. V 1 did not stop and the front of V 1 struck the rear of V 2. The impact with V 1 propelled V 2 forward and the front of V 2 struck the back of V 3. All three vehicles came to final rest in their original lanes of travel on their approximate original headings somewhat beyond their respective points of impact. The driver of V 1 stated that the sun had glared off of the back-light of V 2 and that he was unable to recognize that traffic had stopped.
