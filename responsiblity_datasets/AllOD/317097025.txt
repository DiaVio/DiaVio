This case involved a 46 year old restrained male driver of a 2005 Ford Mustang two door coupe (V1). He was involved in a near side impact with a 1984 Ford F250 pickup truck (V2). The driver of V1 was restrained by the 3-point manual safety belts. V1 was equipped with frontal airbags that did not deploy in the crash, but was not equipped with side impact airbags. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane dry asphalt roadway. The road was straight and level and the posted speed limit was 40 kph (25 mph). V2 was traveling west at approximately 48 kph (30 mph) on the east/west roadway. V1 was traveling south exiting a private gravel drive at about 8 kph (5 mph). V1 attempted to turn left onto the roadway in order to travel east, when it was struck in the left side by the front of V2. V1 rotated approximately 80 degrees counterclockwise and departed the south side of the roadway to final rest. V2 came to rest forward of impact. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage and V2 was driven away. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment of his injuries.
