Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Dodge Neon sedan driven by a 44 year-old male was traveling westbound attempting to make a left turn from the third lane of a four-lane, two-way undivided roadway. V1 attempted to make a left turn without a protected green arrow. The driver did not see a non-contact vehicle traveling eastbound. When the driver of V1 observed the non-contact vehicle, he steered farther to the left to avoid the collision, then over corrected back to the right. V1 then departed the roadway and struck a retaining wall off the east side off the roadway. V1 came to rest partially off the roadway, facing west. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the collision. The 45-year-old male driver of V1 was unwilling to speak with the researcher regarding the accident. The driver would only relate to the researcher that another vehicle had caused him to depart the roadway. The driver received no citations. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
