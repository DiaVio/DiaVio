This case occupant is a 54 year old female front right passenger, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a frontal collision followed by a moderate back end impact and a minor rollover event. There were no air bag deployments and this occupant sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred in darkness, under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mazda Tribute compact utility vehicle, was southbound in lane one of a two lane, two way street. The asphalt travel lanes are straight, have no curbs, and there are embankments present on both sides of the roadway. In V1's precrash area, there is a hillcrest, followed by a slightly downhill section of roadway. As V1 was traveling south, the driver saw a deer in the road and braked and steered left. V1 traveled partially into the northbound lane, then the driver steered right but overcorrected and V1 began to go into a clockwise yaw as it traveled towards the west shoulder. V1 departed the roadway to the right and the front of V1 impacted the embankment, resulting in moderate damage that extended to V1's undercarriage. V1 rotated clockwise and its back end impacted the same embankment. V1 continued to rotate clockwise and as it traveled back onto the roadway, it began to turn-over to the left. V1 completed one quarter turn and came to final rest on its left side, facing northwest in the southbound lane. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the front right passenger of V1, a 54 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. This passenger sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There was a 30 year old female driver, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with no air bag deployments. She sustained minor injuries and her treatment status is unknown.
