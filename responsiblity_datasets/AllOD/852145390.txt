This frontal crash case involves a 27 year old restrained female with a deployed front air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during the early morning hours on a dark two lane, two way, roadway with no street lights. At the time of the crash, it was raining and the asphalt travel lanes were wet. There is a slight downhill grade for vehicles traveling south. The case vehicle one (V1), a four door hatchback 2008 Chrysler PT Cruiser, was traveling south in lane one and was negotiating a left curve. V1 departed the roadway to the right and began to go into a shallow yaw as it traveled on the grassy shoulder. V1 traveled a short distance off the roadway before the front right corner of V1 struck the base of a large tree. The direct damage continued down V1's right side to the base of the right A-pillar. V1 came to final rest near the trees, facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 27 year old female passenger of V1 in the front right position who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, and the instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver of V1 was a 37 year old male who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His frontal steering column mounted and lower left instrument panel knee bolster air bags both deployed on impact. He reportedly sustained no injuries in the crash.
