The case occupant was the 165 cm, 60 kg (5 ft 5 in, 132 lb) 16-year-old female right-front passenger of a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier, 2-door coupe. The Cavalier departed the road and struck a large tree with the right door. The impact was classified as severe. The WinSmash reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 39 kmph (24 mph), which appeared to be consistent with the observed vehicle damage. The case occupant was using the available three-point seat belt. The frontal impact air bags did not deploy. This vehicle is not equipped with side-impact air bags or curtains. In response to the 3 o'clock direction of force, the case occupant moved to her right, relative to the vehicle interior. She sustained several facial, skull and brain injuries including a loss of consciousness for greater than 24 hours, bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral contusions, epidural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury, brain stem injury, basilar and vault skull fractures, and facial and mandibular fractures from contact with the intruding tree trunk. She also sustained multiple right rib fractures (#1-4 posterior), bilateral pulmonary contusions, and a pneumothorax from contact with the interior door surface. She also sustained a right sacral fracture and right inferior and superior pubic rami fractures from contact with the door-mounted armrest. She was unable to recover from the serious brain injuries and died from these injuries twenty-two days post-crash.
