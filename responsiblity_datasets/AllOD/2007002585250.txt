The crash occurred on a level bituminous two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 48 KPH (30 MPH). The roadway was curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 375 meters and a superelevation of .5%. The roadway had been newly paved and had an excessive lip/drop of 20 cm. The roadway was also very narrow (5.9 meters). It was cloudy, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this afternoon weekday crash. Traffic flow was normal for that time of day.

V1, a 1986 Gruman Step-in van, was traveling east on the roadway negotiating the curve to the right. V1 drove off the right side of the roadway and struck and sheared a 30 cm diameter pole with its front. V1 continued a short distance and came to rest facing in an easterly direction. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, the Gruman van, was driven by a belted 50-year-old male who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from work, was traveling 31-40 MPH, drove the roadway several times a month and was not in a hurry. He stated that he isn't quite sure what happened, that he had rounded the curve and may have looked at some children on his right. He went off the right side of the road and his tires got caught on the rim. He attempted to steer and brake, but was unable to steer left and struck the pole. He advised that he was in good health and took no medications.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an external distraction, a driver recognition error. This was chosen because the driver had negotiated the curve, but had looked to his right at some children, taking his attention away from his driving. Additional factors coded to this driver were roadway related factors of narrow roadway and excessive roadway lip/drop. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.
