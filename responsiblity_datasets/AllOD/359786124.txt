This frontal crash case involves a 55 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with deployed frontal, knee, side and curtain air bags who sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred in darkness under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2014 Subaru Forester compact utility vehicle, was eastbound in lane one of a two lane, two way east-west asphalt roadway. There were paved shoulders present on both sides of the travel lanes and grass and woods adjacent to the roadway. In V1's precrash area, the eastbound lane curves to the left with a downhill grade. V1 was negotiating the left curve when the driver fell asleep and V1 departed the lane to the right. V1 crossed over the paved shoulder, began traveling off the south side of the roadway, and the front of V1 impacted a plastic roadside marker, resulting in no visible damage. V1 continued further off the roadway, traveled east through the grass, and then the front of V1 impacted a fence, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued east and then V1's right side swiped a tree, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued east and the front of V1 impacted a tree, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the driver's frontal, knee, left side and left curtain air bags. V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest still in contact with the tree, facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 55 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag, lower left instrument panel mounted knee air bag, outboard left seat back mounted side air bag and left roof side rail mounted curtain air bags all deployed during the fourth crash event. This driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. She was hospitalized for seven days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
