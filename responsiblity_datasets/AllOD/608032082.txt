This case involves a primary top-plane impact resulting in serious injuries to the unrestrained 54-year-old male driver of the case vehicle (case occupant). The case vehicle a 1999 four-door Chevrolet Blazer SUV was westbound on a two-lane asphalt roadway with a slight down-grade. It was dark, but lighted and there was no adverse weather. As the case vehicle was negotiating a right-sweeping curve, the driver lost control and the vehicle started to skid clockwise. The case vehicle crossed the center line, departed the road off the south shoulder and went down an embankment into a ditch. As the case vehicle began to traverse up the opposite embankment, it rolled-over left side leading. As it entered into the first-quarter turn, the vehicle struck a utility pole rotated clockwise around it. The pole was broken by the impact. The vehicle came to rest on its roof, facing east. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the 54-year-old male driver. He was not restrained by a lap and shoulder belt and the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. His left arm was reportedly pinned between the door and the instrument panel. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
