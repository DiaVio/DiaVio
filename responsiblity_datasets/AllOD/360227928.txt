This frontal crash case involves a 64 year old female, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under rainy weather conditions and wet roadways. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara compact utility vehicle, was westbound on a freeway off ramp. In the area where the crash occurred, the off ramp begins as one lane, then widens into two lanes, with shoulders and jersey barriers on both sides. In V1's precrash area, the off ramp is comprised of asphalt, has a downhill grade and curves to the left. The driver of V1 was negotiating the left curve and attempted to move from the right lane to the left lane, when she lost control of the vehicle. V1 departed the travel lanes to the right and the front of V1 impacted a jersey barrier, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag. V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest across the shoulder and right lane, facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 64 year old female, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
