This crash occurred in a lighted area at night on a five lane, two way roadway with a center left turn lane and a posted speed limit of 50mph/80kmph. The weather was clear with dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Ford Tempo, four door sedan, was southbound in lane two. Vehicle three (V3), a compact sport utility vehicle, was following V1 in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Cadillac CTS, four door sedan, was northbound in lane one when it lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise across lane two and the center left turn lane. V2 impacted the raised curb divider before it entered the southbound lane two when the front of V2 impacted into V1 at the left front corner and down its left side. The impact forced V1 to the right across lane one and the paved shoulder and it came to final rest partially on the sidewalk facing southwest. V2 continued to rotate counterclockwise about 270 degrees after impact before the front impacted very lightly the left side of V3 in southbound lane one where V3 had come to final rest after swerving and braking to the right. The case vehicle had two occupants with the second left seat passenger in a child safety seat as the only case occupant. The driver was wearing the automatic shoulder belt without the lap belt and deceased on scene. The case occupant was a two year old in a Graco Comfort forward facing child seat with a three-point harness and shield and no locking clip was used. The case occupant was transported to the trauma center. Both V1 and V2 were disabled and towed. V3 was drivable.
