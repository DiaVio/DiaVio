This case involved an 18 year old restrained male right front passenger of a 2010 Chevrolet Malibu four door sedan (V1). The driver of V1 was an 18 year old unrestrained male. The driver and passenger frontal airbags and the left side impact and head curtain airbags deployed in the crash. The crash occurred at night on a lighted four lane interstate highway divided by a grass median. The dry asphalt roadway was level and curved slightly to the left. V1 was traveling west at approximately 113 kph in the right hand lane of the interstate. V1 departed the roadway to the right and traveled behind a guardrail and down a -17% slope. The front of V1 impacted a small tree breaking it off before swiping a large tree with its right side. V1 rotated clockwise and continued approximately 7 meters before impacting a 70 cm tree with its left front quarter panel. V1 continued rotating in a clockwise direction after impact and came to rest facing north. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The right front passenger (case subject) was transported by air to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of his injuries. The driver was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital for medical treatment.
