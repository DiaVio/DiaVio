This case involved a 33 year old unrestrained male driver of a 2007 Ford F-150 regular cab 4X4 pickup truck (V1). The frontal airbag deployed in the crash but there were no side impact airbags available. This was a single vehicle crash with a barbed wire fence, a large tree and a small tree. The crash occurred at night on a lighted two-lane roadway in a right hand curve. The asphalt road was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit for this roadway was 56 kph (35 mph). V1 was traveling southbound at approximately 80 kph (50 mph) as it entered the curve. V1 traveled across the northbound lane and off the east side of the road and went through a barbed wire fence (events #1 & #2) with its frontal and left side planes, before impacting a 70 cm tree with its frontal plane (event #3). V1 then rotated clockwise 30 degrees striking a small tree with its left side (event #4) and coming to rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver and only occupant of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level two trauma center and later transferred to a level one trauma center due to the severe injuries he received.
