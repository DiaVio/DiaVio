This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 79 year old female driver of a 2000 Saturn LS 4-door hatchback. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an oblique-angle impact with a 1995 Toyota Tacoma Xtra Cab pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was westbound on a two lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. Both vehicles approached a 4-leg intersection controlled by stop signs for north/southbound traffic. Vehicle 1 entered the intersection, across the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 entered the intersection to proceed south, the left front side surface was impacted by the front right area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage. Upon impact, Vehicle 1 rotated sharply clockwise as the left rear side surface struck ("sideslapped") the right side surface of Vehicle 2, which resulted in moderate damage. At this point, both vehicles began their respective post-impact trajectories into the southwest sector of the intersection. Vehicle 1 came to rest along the south shoulder facing southwest. Vehicle 2 continued its post-impact counterclockwise rotation off the south pavement edge and began to travel laterally against the soft soil. This tripping mechanism initiated a one quarter turn right side rollover ("tripover"). Vehicle 2 was reported by police to have come to rest in a private yard (on its right side) facing southeast. The driver of vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
