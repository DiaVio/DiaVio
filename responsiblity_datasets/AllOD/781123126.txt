This case involves the belted 19-year-old male driver of a compact passenger car responding to a 9 o'clock principal direction of force, near side impact with the front of a sport utility vehicle. The subject sustained severe injury as a result. This two-vehicle crash occurred on an east/west street in a residential area at the transition from a six-lane, divided trafficway that became a five-lane, undivided, trafficway. At the pre-crash level, there were two lanes for westbound travel and three lanes for travel eastbound, with a painted median. There was street parking available along both sides of the roadway. The weather was clear and the straight, level, bituminous roadway dry during the morning (daylight), weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2000 Toyota Corolla, 4-door sedan) was legally parked along the north shoulder. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2004 Volvo XC90, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling westbound in the number-two (left) lane. The subject/driver had just entered V1 and intended to make a U-turn, around an island in the center turn lane, adjacent to his parked position. The subject began to move forward (west) and then steered left beginning the U-turn maneuver. Apparently, he did not see V2 approaching in the number-two lane. V1 steered left into the path of V2 where the front plane of V2 struck the left plane of V1. The impact deflected V1 almost, straight sideways (west) to its final rest, facing southeast in the eastbound number-two lane. V2 sustained contact with V1 as it pushed it to its final rest. V2 came to rest with its front still against V1's left plane. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver/V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
