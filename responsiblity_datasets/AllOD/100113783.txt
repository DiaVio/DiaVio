This case involved the belted driver of a smaller passenger car responding to an offset frontal impact, with a non-horizontal secondary force. This single vehicle crash occurred on the northbound side of a multi-lane interstate. There were five lanes for northbound travel including an exit/entrance ramp to the far right. The median consisted of a wide paved shoulder ending at a concrete center divider. The roadway was straight with a slight grade decline leading to the location of incident. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the mid-morning, weekday crash. The case vehicle (2004 Nissan Sentra, 4-door sedan) was traveling northbound in the number-four lane (left). The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row outboard frontal impact air bags. The 34-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint. The subject was traveling straight when he, apparently, began to make a lane change to the left (# 5-lane). The subject suddenly steered the vehicle back to the right and then to the left again. These steering maneuvers resulted in the vehicle traveling off of the west (left) side of the roadway, across the paved median shoulder and into the concrete center divider. The extreme front-left plane of the vehicle struck the barrier at a shallow angle. The frontal impact air bags did not deploy. The vehicle was found at rest on its wheels in the number four-lane facing north (original lane/ direction). Vehicle damage would suggest that the left plane tilted left into the divider. The vehicle separated from the barrier rotating clockwise as its left rear wheel struck and rode up onto the divider. The vehicle continued its clockwise rotation as it came off of the divider and landed on its left rear wheel. The damaged left rear wheel may have caused the vehicle to rotate back to the left (counterclockwise) for its final rest. The vehicle was towed due to disabling wheel damage. The subject (driver) was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury(s).
