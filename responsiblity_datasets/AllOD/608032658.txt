The case vehicle a 4-door 2006 Buick Lucerne was northbound on a dry, level two-lane roadway approaching three-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford F-250 pick-up was eastbound on the intersecting four-lane traffic-way divided by a raised grass median. It was daylight and there was no adverse weather. As the case vehicle began to cross the eastbound lanes it crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise onto the grass median and strike a wooden sign with its left fender before it came to rest facing south-southeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise slightly before it came to rest in the inside eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the 86-year-old male driver. He was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt. The steering-wheel, seat mounted thorax and curtain air bags deployed. The driver was transported to a level one trauma center with critical injuries.
