This case involves an 82-year-old male driver 180 cms (5'11") tall and weighing 80 kilograms (176 pounds). The case occupant was driving a 2008 Ford Focus 4-door sedan involved in a moderate severity frontal crash with a concrete barrier. The principal direction of force was 11 o'clock. The case occupant was properly restrained with a 3-point manual belt and had a steering wheel, seat back side, and driver side curtain air bags available to him, all of which deployed as a result of the crash. The case occupant sustained a heart attack pre-impact. On impact, the driver moved forward and to the left, loading the driver's door as evidenced by deformation and a left hip contusion (iliacus muscle). His pelvic ring fractures probably occurred when his left hip loaded the left armrest which also resulted in a bladder rupture and a laceration to the iliac artery. His bilateral rib fractures (Right #1, 6, and 8 and Left #1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 10), left lung contusion, and left humerus fracture were probably sustained by loading the driver's door with his shoulder. The C2 and C7 cervical and T1 and T2 thoracic spine fractures, including a C6-7 dislocation with paraplegia, probably occurred when the top of his head loaded the intruded base of the A-pillar or the left roof side rail buckling his spine. The case occupant sustained right 3rd, 4th, and 5th metatarsal fractures possibly from contact with the foot controls. Weak bones (osteopenia) likely contributed to the quantity and severity of his fractures.
