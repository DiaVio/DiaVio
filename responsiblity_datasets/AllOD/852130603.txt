This two vehicle head-on crash occurred at night with no streetlights on a two lane, two way roadway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Escort ZX2 two door was eastbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse two door hatchback was traveling westbound in the eastbound lane as it was passing overtaking another unknown westbound vehicle. V2 began to lock up the brakes and return to the westbound lane just before the front left of V2 impacted the front left of case V1. Case V1 rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees and came to final rest at the point of impact with the back tires in the ditch off the south edge of the roadway. V2 rotated counterclockwise with a northwest trajectory from the point of impact across the westbound lane and then departed the roadway to the right into a grassy area. V2 came to final rest facing northeast after rotating about 200 degrees counterclockwise from point of impact. Both vehicles were damaged and towed from the crash scene. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 22 year old female, who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and the frontal air bag deployed on impact. It was noted that she had put the shoulder belt portion under her left arm. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the CIREN trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
