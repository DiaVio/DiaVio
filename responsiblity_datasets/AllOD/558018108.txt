The restrained 75-year-old male driver of the 1997 Buick Century sedan moved rearward into the seat back in response to the severe six-o'clock impact with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car (V2). After the rear impact, the rebound off the seat back caused him to flex forward. During the counterclockwise rotation of the case vehicle, his tangential velocity put him, leaning somewhat forward, in contact with the center-console prior to the second impact with the 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix. In response to the second severe three o'clock impact the occupant loaded the center-console and the intruding right-front seat back. The Intraventricular/ intracerebral hemorrhage involving interpeduncle cistern and left occipital horn subarachnoid blood, is possibly due to contact with the right-front seat headrest. The distracted, displaced fracture of the T3 vertebral body, the contusion of the thoracic spinal cord with incomplete cord syndrome (right sided hemiparalysis), the T4 lamina fracture, the T4 spinous process fracture, the fractures of the 2nd to 10th right ribs (3rd to 7th displaced) and fractures of the left 3rd, 5th, & 7th ribs, with hemo-pneumothorax, the focal contusion of the right lung, the right clavicle fracture and the right elbow abrasion are probably due to contact with the right front seat back. The small liver laceration is due to contact with the center console. The abrasions to the bilateral shoulder blades is from contact with the anterior surface of the right-front seat back.
