Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 58-year old, male driver, of a 2007 Lincoln Navigator, who was involved in a frontal collision with a utility pole. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight) of a spring weekend, at the intersection of a four-lane, east/west roadway and a north/south trafficway. The eastern leg of the intersection is composed of three westbound lanes and one eastbound lane. The western leg of the intersection is composed of two westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes. These two legs are notably offset from each other. The north and south legs did not play a part in the crash. The speed limit for the east/west roadway is 35 mph (56 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were reported to be dry. The overall environment is commercial. Vehicle 1, the 2007 Lincoln Navigator, was being operated by the 58-year old male case occupant. He was stopped at the eastern leg of the intersection, in the westbound through lane. He intended to travel through the intersection and continue traveling west. The case occupant was unbelted, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front outboard) and roof side rail curtains. Crash: Vehicle 1 entered/accelerated into the intersection, and due to a preceding medical condition, the driver lost control. Vehicle 1 traversed the intersection, but departed the roadway at the northwest corner of the intersection where it struck a utility pole with its frontal plane after jumping the curb. Vehicle 1 pivoted somewhat clockwise at the pole and came to rest at the impact area. As a result the pole impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
