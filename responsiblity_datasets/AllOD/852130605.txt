This two vehicle frontal crash occurred with street lights at night on a five lane, two way roadway with center lane for left turns. It was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse two door hatchback was northbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Cadillac Escalade was southbound and was passing over taking vehicles when the front left corner of V2 impacted the front left corner of V1 in the northbound lane 2. V1 rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees and came to final rest near the point of impact across the northbound lanes one and two. V2 post impact rotated slight counterclockwise but continued southeasterly across the northbound lanes and then departed the roadway off the east curb edge. V2 continued on grassy area and began to then curve to the right when it impacted the front of V2 with an electrical box, then a large cement block, and finally a fence. V2 went through the fence and came to final rest in a ditch area. Both vehicles were damaged and towed from the scene. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 72 year old female, who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She was transported to the CIREN trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
