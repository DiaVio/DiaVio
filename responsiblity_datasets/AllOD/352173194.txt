Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 68-year old, female driver, of a 2004 Suzuki XL7 compact utility vehicle, which was involved in a frontal impact. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the evening hours (dark), of a fall weekday, on a slightly curved, two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally north and south within a mixed residential/commercial area. The southbound travel direction has a downhill grade and a slight left turning curve. At time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for this roadway is 55 mph (89 km/h). Vehicle 1, the 2004 Suzuki XL7, was being operated by the 68-year old female driver (case occupant), in the northbound travel lane. She was approaching a residential driveway, located on the west side, and intended to turn left at the driveway. She was utilizing her respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt (with pretensioner) and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with frontal impact air bags. Vehicle 2, a 1998 Jeep Wrangler, was traveling southbound approaching the residential driveway from the north. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: As Vehicle 1 started to turn left, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 1. As a result, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in at or near the center of the roadway. Vehicle 2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest at the west shoulder area. As a result of the impact, the frontal air bags for Vehicle 1 deployed and the driver's seat belt pretensioner actuated. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital, but was later transferred to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
