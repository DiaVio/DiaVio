Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 BMW 330i, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was approaching a left curve in the road. It was dark, the weather was foggy, but the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1, while negotiating the left curve, ran off the right side of the road and struck a tree with the center-portion of the front bumper. V1 then rotated counterclockwise approximately 60 degrees endswiping another tree with the rear bumper. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 33-year-old male driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 27-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. This vehicle is equipped with door-mounted side airbags but they did not deploy. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a level-one trauma center.
