Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural highway, negotiating a left curve and approaching a three-leg intersection (where the road becomes 3-lanes to accomodate right turns). Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford F150, 4-door pickup truck was traveling north in the northbound lane of the same road, was following a non-contact vehicle (NCV), and was negotiating a right curve. It was dusk, raining, and the bituminous road was wet. As V2 approached the three-leg intersection the driver began to pass the NCV on the left by entering the southbound lane. The driver of V1 could not avoid V2 and the two vehicles collided headon in an offset-frontal mode. After impact V1 rotated in a counterclockwise manner approximately 90 degrees and came to rest in the mouth of the three-leg intersection facing east. V2 rotated in a counterclockwise manner approximately 80 degrees and came to rest in the northbound lane facing west/northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The driver of V2 was transported to a local hospital and was fatally injured. The 54-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment.
