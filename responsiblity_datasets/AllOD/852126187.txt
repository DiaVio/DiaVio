This crash occurred at a traffic controlled intersection during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Scion xA four door hatchback was westbound in lane two of a four lane two way street divided by a raised curb median. Vehicle two (V2) was a transit bus that was travelling northbound on a two lane, two way street dedicated to bus traffic only. Both vehicles were travelling straight through the intersection when the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V2 being dominant pushed V1 laterally into the northwest corner of the intersection as it appeared V2 was swerving to the left and braking just prior and during post impact. V1 then rotated clockwise ahead of V2 and rolled to north some distance before it came to final rest in the southbound lane facing north. V1 came to final rest facing northwest in the southbound lane at the northwest corner of the intersection. V1 as well as V2 had to be towed due to damage from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and only person in the vehicle. This case driver was a 52 year old male who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt with the steering column mounted air bag deploying on impact. The case occupant sustained serious injury and was transported to the trauma center.
