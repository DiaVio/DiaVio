Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Toyota Corolla, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Ford Edge, 4-door wagon was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. It was dark, the weather was cloudy, and the asphalt road surface was snow-covered. The driver of V1 lost control of his vehicle due to speed and slippery road conditions and V1 crossed the centerline and into the westbound lane. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique, offset-frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 55-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
