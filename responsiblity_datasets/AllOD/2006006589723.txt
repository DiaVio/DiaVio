This single-vehicle crash began on the asphalt roadway and ended on a cement driveway and curb. Both surfaces were level and icy with snow patches. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). There were no traffic control devices at this mid point of the road. The crash occurred in the late afternoon on a weekday. The traffic flow was normal and the weather was clear.

Vehicle one, a 2000 Jeep Cherokee, was traveling north on a four-way undivided roadway when it turned eastward and contacted with its front right the metal fence located on its right beyond the curb area. After the initial impact, vehicle one continued traveling, a couple feet, and contacted with its left side the metal opened gate causing severe damage to the “B” pillar. The metal gate was pushed to a close position after the impact and vehicle one came to final rest straddling the curb. The vehicle was disabled from the impacts and towed later. However, police on scene documented it as a non-towed vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of V1, a 36-year old female, said she was traveling north on her way back to work from an errand at about 56 kmph (35 mph) when she attempted to make a right turn eastward when her brakes snapped and she lost control of the vehicle and hit the metal fence. She didn't make any mention of the snow or icy road. Although sliding on the icy road contributed to her loss off control and played a major role in the crash. The driver was injured and transported to the hospital.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event was vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason was coded as a decision error: too fast for snow and icy conditions. Associated factors coded to this driver include did not realize that caution was required.
