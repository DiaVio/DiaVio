This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 44 year old male driver of a 2006 Toyota Scion XA. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1990 Chevrolet K-1500 pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two-lane roadway and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was westbound on the same roadway. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed Vehicle 2 to cross the centerline, and into the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the eastbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage. Both vehicles rotated counter-clockwise to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest off the south pavement edge facing northeast, as Vehicle 2 came to rest across the travel lanes facing northeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The case occupant was 102 kg (224 lbs) in weight, and 185 cm (73 in) in height. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
