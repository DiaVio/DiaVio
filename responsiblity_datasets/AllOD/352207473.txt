Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an 82-year old, male driver, of a 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe, who was involved in an offset frontal impact with the side plane of a 2004 Peterbilt, medium straight-truck. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight) of winter weekday, on a straight two-lane roadway. This north/south roadway consists of two travel lanes and is relatively level. The speed limit is 50 mph (80 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe compact utility vehicle, was being operated by the 82-year old male driver (case occupant), in the northbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was noted to be utilizing his 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags and side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling northbound. Vehicle 2, a 2004 Peterbilt 6x4 medium truck, was traveling southbound. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 drifted into the southbound travel lane and the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 (front left) struck the left side plane of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 1 rotated 360 degrees counterclockwise out of the impact and came to rest in the northbound travel, facing a northerly direction. Vehicle 2 subsequently departed the west side of the roadway and came to rest in a drainage ditch, facing a southerly direction. As a result of the impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed and the driver's retractor type pretensioner actuated for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was removed from the vehicle by the responding fire/rescue personnel and transported, by air unit, to a local trauma center. The driver of Vehicle 1 was hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to have sustained non-incapacitating injuries and was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital. The extent of his injuries and treatment, if any, are unknown. Both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
