This case involved a 52 year old unrestrained female driver of a 2008 Pontiac Torrent sport utility vehicle (V1). The driver was not utilizing the manual safety belt, but had a deployed frontal airbag. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a rural two lane roadway that was straight and level. The asphalt road was dry with no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph). V1 was traveling north at an unknown speed, when it departed the right side of the roadway and traveled down an embankment. V1 struck a concrete culvert with its frontal plane and then rotated slightly counterclockwise striking a large boulder with its right side and coming to final rest against the boulder. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by air to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to the severity of her injuries.
