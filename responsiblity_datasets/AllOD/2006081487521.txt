A single-vehicle crash occurred mid-morning during daylight hours. The collision occurred on a busy two-lane, two-way undivided rural highway in lane one. The southbound lanes have a slight curve to the left, on a level bituminous roadway. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph) with curve warning signs posted.

Vehicle one (V 1), a 1990 Honda Accord sedan, driven by a 17 year-old male was traveling southbound in lane one, with a temporary use only spare on the left rear. The remaining three tires on the vehicle were oversized (e.g. two sizes larger than recommended). As V1 negotiated a curve to the left, while talking on his cell phone, he lost control of his vehicle and departed the roadway via the right shoulder. The right rear corner of the vehicle impacted a power pole, and then rotated clockwise, and traveled 22 meters (72 feet) southbound into the right side ditch. V1 was towed out of the ditch. The driver stated he was unfamiliar with the roadway, but later stated he drives the route daily. He said that he was on the cell phone with his cousin, who is also his boss, trying to find the location of where he was to be working that day. Inexperience was considered a factor for this driver. He has been driving for just 12 months and within the past 6 months he completed defensive driver training. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: internal distraction, for talking on his cell phone.
