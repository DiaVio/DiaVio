This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 43-year-old, male driver with deployed airbags. He sustained severe injuries in a frontal collision with a large tree. The crash occurred at dusk on a dry roadway under clear skies. A 2012 Chrysler 200 sedan (V1) was traveling east negotiating a left curve. The suburban, bituminous roadway had three lanes, including a two-way center turn lane. The grade for V1 was 5% uphill. As V1 was negotiating the left curve, the driver lost consciousness and traveled off the road to the right. According to police, V1 sideswiped a utility pole with its front left, however, no evidence was found to substantiate a pole impact. V1 then impacted a large tree head-on (Event 1). V1 came to final rest at impact with the tree and was towed due to damage. The 43-year-old, male driver was unbelted. The retractor pretensioner actuated, locking the belt in the unused position. The steering wheel hub, right instrument panel, right outboard seatback, and right curtain airbags were deployed. The available left outboard seatback and left curtain airbags were not deployed. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center for treatment of severe injuries.
