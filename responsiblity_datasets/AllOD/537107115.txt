Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way dirt/gravel roadway. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and V1 drifted off the right side of the road causing the driver to wake and steer sharply to the left. V1departed the left side of the road and the driver steered to the right in an attempt to regain control of the vehicle. V1 began a clockwise yaw, tripped over its left wheels and began to roll left side leading. While V1 was airborne and turned 90 degrees to its longitudinal axis, the top of the hood, windshield, and front portion of the roof struck a large tree next to the road. V1 then rotated counterclockwise, separated from the tree and came to rest in its roof, in the eastbound lane, facing south. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 32-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
