Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 20-year-old, male driver of a 2002 Hyundai Elantra 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a near side impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the post midnight hours (dark) of a late spring weekend, on a two-lane, east/way roadway. This roadway is level, but has a left turning curve at the area of the crash. The roadway has a speed limit of 50 mph (80 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2002 Hyundai Elantra 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 20-year-old male driver in the eastbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by his 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with redesigned frontal air bags and side impact air bags (head/torso) at the front, outboard positions. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the left turning curve and continue traveling east. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the left turning curve, it departed the right side of the roadway. Vehicle 1 traveled some distance across an open field (front lawn of a residential unit) before striking a tree with its left side plane. Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and deflected off the first tree and into a grove of trees where its right side plane struck two different trees before coming to rest. As a result of the first impact, the driver's frontal air bag and the driver's side impact air bag deployed (head/torso). Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was able to self-extricate himself from the vehicle and refused treatment at the scene. However, the driver of Vehicle 1 subsequently sought treatment later on at a local medical facility and was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due damage sustained in the crash.
