This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 63-year-old female driver of a 2013 Honda CR-V EX all-wheel-drive sport utility. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (for the driver and front right passenger positions), and curtain air bags (for all outboard seating positions). The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal run-off-road collision with a large rock (event 1). The crash occurred off of the north road edge of a 4-lane east/west state trafficway. The westbound roadway consisted of 2 asphalt surfaced lanes which curved left (with an uphill grade). The westbound roadway was bordered to the north by a thick wooded area and to the south by a W-beam guardrail. The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 45 mph (72 km/h). It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 1 was initially westbound in the outboard travel lane within the straightaway. As the case vehicle reached the apex of the left curve, the driver allowed it to continue onto the shoulder in a forward tracking mode. As Vehicle 1 approached an area of thick vegetation, the front right area impacted a large rock which was partially submerged in the soil (event 1). The impact resulted in moderate damage, as sustained contact with the fixed object continued into the vehicle's undercarriage. Vehicle 1 came to rest in close proximity to the struck object (off the north road edge) facing northwest. The 63-year-old female driver of the 2013 Honda CR-V was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-forward track position. The lack of restraint use was evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system, relative to the contact pattern documented across interior frontal components. At impact, the driver initiated a forward and downward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force. It should be noted that the upper and lower portions of the steering rim were deformed (with full compression of the steering column shear capsules). Following the collision, the unrestrained driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported by air to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injury. The case vehicle was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
