This case involves a restrained 58 year old female driver in a 2010 Nissan Sentra (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The frontal steering mounted airbag, right side curtain, and right outboard seatback mounted airbag all deployed during the crash. V2, a 2012 Chevrolet Equinox was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred on a dry, asphalt, undivided two-way, five-lane road with a center two-way left turn lane. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was traveling in the inside straight lane while heading west on the westbound side of the roadway. V2 was traveling straight in the center turn lane heading east when V1 drifted left and over the left lane line. V1 completely entered the center turn lane and contacted the front right of V2, with its front right. V1 rotated clockwise after impact and came to rest in the eastbound lanes facing north. V2 rotated clockwise after impact and came to rest in the westbound lanes facing south. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by ground. She was then treated for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
