This severe frontal head-on crash involved a 77 year old female who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column air bag deployed. She sustained moderate severity lower extremity injuries and was transported to the trauma center and hospitalized. This crash occurred during daylight hours on a divided freeway at an interchange area. The weather was clear and roadway surface was dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Ford Taurus four door wagon was northbound in lane 2 of 2 one-way lanes of a freeway divided by a concrete traffic barrier with two southbound one-way lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Pontiac Vibe was northbound in lane 1 of 2 and just south of an exit ramp to the right. V1 changed lanes into lane 1 to exit the freeway at this exit and the right side of V1 impacted the left side of V2 with minor damage. Both V1 and V2 moved to the left and sustained contact across lane 2 and the paved shoulder until the front of V1 impacted the concrete traffic barrier with a frontal swiping force. The front left of V1 then climbed up and over the barrier due to the continued contact from V2. V1 then slid on the undercarriage on top of the barrier before it rolled to the left and landed first on the left back quarter panel in the southbound lanes. V1 completed a four quarter turn rollover still sliding forward and returned back on to its tires facing north in the south bound lanes. V2 rotated counterclockwise and remained in the northbound lanes and rolled over 2 quarter turns and came to final rest on its roof top across both lanes facing west. V1 back on its tire facing north now in the southbound lane 2 with some forward motion was then struck head-on (front to front) with Vehicle 3 (V3), a 1999 Dodge Ram pickup. After impact with V1, V3 veered to the right and departed the roadway and came to final rest in the grassy ditch facing east. V1 then rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees and was forced south post impact with V3 and entered into southbound lane 1. Vehicle 4 (V4), a 2003 Ford Taurus, was travelling in the southbound lane 1 and the front of V4 swiped the right side of V1 with minor damage. V1 then continued to rotate counterclockwise and came to final rest over lane one and the west shoulder facing east. V4 was able to continue with minor damage and drove to the shoulder and stopped facing south. Vehicles, 1,2, and 3 were all towed due to damage and V4 was driven away. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only passenger in V1. She is a 77 year old female who was wearing a lap/shoulder belt and the front steering column air bag deployed during the head-on impact with V3. She sustained moderate severity lower extremity fractures and was transported to the trauma center and hospitalized.
