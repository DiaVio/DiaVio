This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 76-year-old male belted driver with deployed airbags who sustained moderate injuries and a 74-year-old female belted right front passenger with deployed airbags who suffered serious injuries. The case vehicle was an intermediate-size sedan which struck several trees with its front and right planes. The crash occurred late afternoon on a dry road in clear weather. A 2013 Chevrolet Malibu LTZ intermediate-size sedan (Vehicle 1) was negotiating a left curve on a two-way, two-lane rural bituminous road heading north. There was a 6% uphill grade with +8% superelevation in the curve. As V1 negotiated the left curve, it traveled off the road to the right. V1 traveled up a slight embankment before impacting a small tree with its front plane (Event 1). The impact knocked the tree over as V1 began rotating counterclockwise. The front right of V1 then impacted a second small tree with its front plane on the right bumper corner (Event 2). V1 subsequently struck a third small tree with its right plane (Event 3). The second and third trees also were pushed over by the impact. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 76-year-old male case occupant. He was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. Airbag deployments for his position included the steering wheel hub, knee bolster, and curtain airbags. The available outboard seatback airbag did not deploy. He was transported to a local trauma center where he was treated for moderate injuries sustained in the collision. The right front seat was occupied by a 75-year-old female case occupant. She was also belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. Airbag deployments for her position included the top instrument panel, knee bolster, curtain, and outboard seatback airbags. She was transported to a local trauma center where she was treated for serious injuries.
