A single vehicle crash occurred during early evening at dusk on a two-lane non-divided asphalt wet roadway. This roadway runs east to west with a left hand curve when going east. This roadway is on a downgrade of -4% with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph)

Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chevy Â½ ton truck driven by a 27 year-old male with one passenger was traveling eastbound at 107 kph (68 mph) and had just completed the left hand curve when it began to rotate counter-clockwise. This pickup rotated 180 degrees in the roadway then began to exit the left side road-edge going backwards. The driver pumped the brakes to stop the vehicle but the pickup still exited the road-edge. Once off the road edge, V1 began to rotate clockwise as it went down into a drainage ditch. V1 then impacted a small tree with the right rear quarter panel and tripped over onto the passenger side rolling onto its' roof. V1 then slid down the drain ditch where it came to rest on its roof heading in an easterly direction, driver felt the vehicle hit some water then the vehicle began to rotate counter-clockwise. He felt he had hydro planed which caused the vehicle to rotate 180 degrees. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.
