This crash occurred on a five-lane asphalt roadway at the entrance to a mall. The road was straight and the speed limit was 35mph (56kph).

Vehicle 1 was a 1996 Ford Windstar with two occupants. Vehicle 2 was a 2001 GMC Yukon with one occupant. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.

Vehicle 1 was traveling west in lane 1 approaching the intersection and vehicle 2 was turning left (north) from the eastbound lane 2. Vehicle 2 turned left across the path of vehicle 1 and the front of vehicle 1 contacted the front right of vehicle 2. Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection.

The critical precrash event was vehicle 2 turning left across the path of vehicle 1.

The critical reason for the critical precrash event was the driver of vehicle 2 making a false assumption of vehicle 1's actions. The driver of vehicle 2 assumed that vehicle 1 would turn right (north) rather than proceed through the intersection. Witnesses and the driver of V2 stated that vehicle 1's right turn signal was activated. The driver of vehicle 1 stated that her left turn signal was activated because she intended to change lanes to the left.
