This two vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane, two way roadway with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Dodge Stratus four door sedan was eastbound and was negotiating a curve right in the roadway with a downgrade. Vehicle two, a 2007 Saturn Vue compact utility vehicle was traveling westbound straight prior to entering the curve. As V1 was in the curve the driver of V1 lost control and swerved to the left, then to the right and back to left again. V1 then began to rotate counterclockwise about 90 degrees and crossed into the opposite lane of travel just beyond the curve. The front of V2 then collided into the right side rear half of V1 and post impact rotated V1 immediately clockwise 180 degrees. V1 then departed the north side of the roadway into a ditch and the left side back and left rear tire impacted the embankment that caused V1 to rollover to the left onto the left side and then to roof top where it came to final rest in the ditch facing west. V2 came to final rest near the point of impact and was slightly rotated clockwise and still in the westbound lane. Both vehicles were damage and towed. The case occupant is the driver of V1 who is a 17 year old female wearing a lap/shoulder restraint. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center. Another female teenager was seated in the front right position who was lap/shoulder restrained and had only minor injuries.
