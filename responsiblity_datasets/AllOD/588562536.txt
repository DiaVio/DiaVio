Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a belted 52-year-old male driver of a 2012 Cadillac CTS-V 2-door coupe, which was primarily involved in a non-horizontal, left side impact with a utility pole (interrupted rollover). Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the early evening hours (daylight) on a two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally east and west and has an uphill grade leading into a left turning curve for the eastbound travel direction. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The roadway has a speed limit of 40 mph (64 km/h). Vehicle 1, the 2012 Cadillac CTS-V 2-door coupe, was being operated by the 52-year-old male driver (case occupant) in the eastbound travel lane. Occupying the right front seating position and the right rear seating position was a 19-year-old male passenger and an 18-year-old male passenger, respectively. The 52-year-old driver and the 19-year-old right front passenger were both restrained by their respective 3-point lap/shoulder belts. It could not be determined if the 18-year-old right rear passenger was utilizing his 3-point lap/shoulder belt. Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side impact air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the left turning curve and continue traveling east. Crash: For unknown reasons, as Vehicle 1 traveled east while negotiating the left turning curve it drifted slightly off the south roadway edge. The driver is suspected of steering left, but then over steering right, placing the vehicle in a left side leading yaw. Vehicle 1 traveled along the south roadside where it subsequently struck a support wire (for a utility pole) with its left side plane before starting to rollover. As Vehicle 1 started to rollover, it subsequently struck another support wire with its frontal plane, a utility junction box with its left side plane and a utility pole with the left side plane (interrupted roll). During this impact sequence, one of the support wires impacted Vehicle 1's right A-pillar (and possibly the left A-pillar). Vehicle 1 snapped the utility pole, but began to rotate counterclockwise. Vehicle 1 traveled through the impacted utility pole and continued in an easterly direction while rotating counterclockwise. Vehicle 1 came to rest, east of the impact area, facing a westerly direction. As a result of the crash, Vehicle 1's frontal air bags deployed, as did the roof side rail curtains. Based upon the event data record (EDR), at least five events could be associated with this crash, with the EDR storing a total of three, deployment level events. Of the three deployment level events, the first (rollover event) commanded the frontal pretensioners to actuate and the side rail curtains to deployed (command to deploy curtains occurring 1.46 seconds after algorithm enable). The second deployment level event commanded the frontal air bags to deploy, while the third deployment level event (another rollover level event) met the threshold to deploy the side rail curtains, which had already been deployed. Post-Crash: All three occupants of Vehicle 1 were removed from the vehicle by responding emergency medical services personnel. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by air unit, to a local trauma center (overnight admission), but was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center the next day and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. The right front passenger and the right rear passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local hospital, treated and released with reportedly minor injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
