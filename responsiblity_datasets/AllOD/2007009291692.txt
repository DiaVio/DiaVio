The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a three-lane roadway with a 25-meter wide dirt and grass strip and guardrail dividing the three southbound lanes from the two northbound lanes.

V1, a 1998 Chevrolet Prism four-door sedan, was driven by a 59 year-old female traveling with her 83 year-old mother. The driver stated that she had driven over one hundred miles from out-of-state when the crash occurred. She had been traveling in lane one, traveling at a rate of about 89 kmph (55 mph). She noticed that the traffic signal ahead was green and the vehicles in the neighboring lanes (lane two and three) were moving forward and assumed the vehicles stopped in her traffic lane (lane one) would also proceed forward. When she realized that the traffic in lane one remained stopped she braked hard unsuccessfully, skidding into the rear of V2 with the front of V1. Neither occupant was injured or transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
