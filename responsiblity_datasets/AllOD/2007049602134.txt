This two-vehicle crash occurred at an intersection. The east/west road is a 3-lane undivided concrete roadway that curves to the right while traveling west approaching the intersection. The radius of curvature is 375 meters (1230 feet). The roadway has a stop sign at the intersection with the north/south roadway. The north/south road is a four lane divided (no positive barrier) right curved roadway while traveling in the southbound direction while approaching the intersection. The radius of curvature is 141 meters (462 feet). The speed limit for the north/south roadway is 64 kmph (40 mph). The speed limit for the east/west roadway is 54 kmph (35 mph). The road surface was dry and there were no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. It was early afternoon on a weekend and there was minimal traffic on the roadways.

Vehicle one (V1) a 1993 Toyota Tacoma Pick up, was traveling west in the second lane of traffic. Vehicle two (V2) a 2003 Nissan Altima, was traveling south in the second lane of traffic approaching the intersection of both roadways. V1 stopped at the stop sign and waited for several vehicles to pass from south to north. V1 proceeded into the intersection to turn left with the intention to turn into lane two of the southbound lanes. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise and traveled in a southerly direction. V1 came to rest in lane three, with its left side wheels off the road, facing northwest. V2 rotated counterclockwise after the separation of the vehicles and came to rest in lane two, facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. No one was transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

A 27-year old male drove V1, the 1993 Toyota Pick up. He is in good health and does not take any medication. He was coming from a job site located near the scene and was heading to another job site. He was well rested and in no hurry. Despite driving a friend's vehicle, he was familiar with the vehicle. He stated he let several cars cross in front of him before he started his left turn. He said he looked into his intended turning direction when V2 came at a high rate of speed and hit him. He did not see V2 prior to impact.

The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related error: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). The driver did not look to his right again after letting several cars pass.

A 19-year old female, who reported light injuries, drove V2, the 2003 Nissan Altima. She stated she was in the second lane, traveling at a normal rate of speed. She saw V1 moving into the intersection, but she assumed that the driver of V1 would yield the right-of-way. V1 continued to proceed into the intersection and the driver of V2 applied the brakes in an attempt to avoid the collision.

The critical pre crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroaching into the lane: from crossing street, turning into same direction. No critical reason for the critical event was coded to this vehicle.
