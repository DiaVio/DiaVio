This case involves a minor one-quarter turn rollover resulting in an impact to the left side of the case vehicle. The case occupant is the 67-year-old female right-front passenger. She was restrained by a three-point belt and the top instrument-panel and side curtain air bags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2008 Ford Edge SUV was in the outside, southbound lane of a dry, level, asphalt, four-lane divided highway. It was daylight and clear. The case vehicle departed the road off the right side, traversed a down slope, entered a ditch, and began to yaw counterclockwise. The undercarriage struck an embankment, as the vehicle sideswiped a tree with its right side, entering a clockwise yaw. The case vehicle rolled one-quarter turn and came to rest approximately 20 feet from point of impact with the embankment on its left side, facing west. Both the 68-year-old male driver and the 67-year-old female right-front passenger were restrained by a three-point belt. Both frontal-impact air bags and the left and right curtain air bags deployed. The driver sustained police reported possible injuries. Both occupants were transported to an outside hospital. The case occupant was transferred to a level-one trauma center.
