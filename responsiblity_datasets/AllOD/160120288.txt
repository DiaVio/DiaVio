Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2002 Ford Explorer, four-door, SUV (case study vehicle). V1 was occupied by a male, age 20 as its driver and lone occupant. V1's occupant was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and the frontal airbags did not deploy.

The crash occurred during the hours of darkness. The weather at the time of the crash was clear and dry. The roadway surface was dry. The posted speed limit is 45 mph (72 kmph).

The crash occurred on a two lane roadway. The roadway travels primarily east and west. The eastbound direction has a right curve and a negative grade of 2 percent. The westbound direction has a left curve. The roadway is bordered by ditches on both sides. The roadway is divided by a double yellow line.

V1 was traveling eastbound. V1 ran off the left side of the road and traveled into a grassy area. V1 started to the right evident by the yawing marks in the grass. V1 continued on until impacting a tree with its left side. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise before coming to rest in a private drive.

The case study participant was transported by air to a trauma center.
