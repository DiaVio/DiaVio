Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 60-year old, female driver, of a 2007 Infiniti G35 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a rollover type event. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the evening hours (dark), of a winter weekday, on a three-lane, southbound roadway. This roadway represents the southbound travel direction on a north/south trafficway. At the area of the crash, the roadway is straight and has a slight downhill grade. The speed limit for this roadway is 55 mph (89 km/h). At time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2007 Infiniti G35 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 60-year old female driver (case occupant), in the right southbound travel lane. She intended to continue traveling south. She was utilizing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags, front, seat back mounted torso/hip side impact air bags and side rail curtains. Vehicle 2, a 2003 Ford F-250 pick-up truck, was traveling southbound in the far left southbound lane. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 2 departed the left side of the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 2 initiated a right steering maneuver, but lost control. Vehicle 2 traveled across all the southbound travel lanes and struck Vehicle 1's left front corner with its right rear wheel (suspected). Vehicle 2 continued on while rotating clockwise, departing the right side of the roadway. At this time, Vehicle 2 struck a guardrail with its frontal plane as it rotated. Vehicle 2 eventually overturned, flipping to the opposite of the guardrail and came to rest at an unknown location. As a result of its impact with Vehicle 2, Vehicle 1 was redirected to the right. At this time, the driver is believed to have steered left, but over steered causing the right front tire to debead and the vehicle to trip. Vehicle 1 rolled four quarter turns before landing on its wheels. At this time, Vehicle 1 is believed to have struck the right roadside guardrail with its left rear corner as it slid to a stop along the right roadside, facing north. As a result of the crash, the driver's, torso/hip side air bag deployed as did the left roof side rail curtain. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to minor to serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be possibly injured, but was not transported. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
