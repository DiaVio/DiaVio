This frontal crash case involves a 57 year old restrained female with a deployed front air bag who sustained severe injuries. The crash occurred at dusk, on an overcast day with wet roadway conditions. The collision occurred on a two lane, two way, undivided asphalt highway with paved shoulders. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is straight with a downhill grade for northbound vehicles. On the east side of the highway, there is a ditch next to the shoulder, followed by an area containing ferns, small shrubs and trees. The case vehicle one (V1), is a 2004 Suzuki XL7 four door sports utility vehicle with a rear hatch. V1 was traveling north in lane one when it traveled off the east side of the highway. V1 departed the roadway, traveled down the ditch, and the front of V1 impacted a large tree. V1 rebounded slightly from the tree impact and came to final rest facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 57 year old female driver who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. At impact, this case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other passengers in the vehicle.
