This crash occurred in the early evening of a weekday on the east roadside of a rural roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with soft grass shoulders. The bituminous roadway curved left (in the northbound direction) and featured a 2% uphill grade and a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). The roadway was wet from a rain that was falling but the traffic flow was normal at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Dodge Ram pickup, was northbound negotiating the left curve. V1 lost control in the curve and traveled off the right side of the roadway. V1 traveled approximately 65m (213 ft.) before impacting a utility pole with its front plane. The pole subsequently cracked, bringing down the power lines attached to it. V1 came to rest against the utility pole in the east roadside. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 38-year old male, was uninjured. His front seat passenger was also uninjured. The driver was taking an unspecified pain killer at the time of the crash. He had not taken any form of driver's education, although he has been driving for 22 years. The driver stated that an oncoming vehicle had drifted into his lane, forcing him off the roadway, however no evidence was found on-scene to support this claim. He estimated his travel speed to be 72kmph (45 mph). The Dodge pickup was towed due to damage.
