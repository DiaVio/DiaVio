This case involved a belted driver responding to a right side leading trip over with frontal impact air bag deployment. This single vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, undivided, level, roadway in a rural agricultural area. The north/south roadway had a single lane for travel in each direction. For northbound travel the roadway was straight and then became a left curve. The right (east) roadside consisted of a level dirt shoulder followed by agricultural fields. The left (west) roadside consisted of a dirt shoulder with a gradual downward slope followed by agricultural fields. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the midday, weekend, crash. The case vehicle (1999 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling northbound at a police reported (estimated) 105 kmph. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The 34-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint. The vehicle drove northbound on the straight stretch of road. At the point where the road curved left the driver did not and the vehicle drove off of the right side of the roadway. The vehicle tracked along the dirt shoulder until the driver made a steering input/correction to the left in an attempt to regain the roadway. The vehicle came back into the roadway in a counterclockwise yaw. As the vehicle slid across the roadway its right front tire lost its bead and the rim gouged into the roadway, helping to trip the vehicle to the right. The vehicle landed first on the top left roof rail/A-pillar/windshield header, based on vehicle damage. The frontal impact air bags deployed. There were four separate areas of significant non-horizontal impacts occurring to the vehicle, three to the greenhouse and one to the undercarriage. The vehicle overturned an estimated 12 quarter-turns and came to rest in the field, on its wheels facing southwest. The measured distance from the trip point to final rest was 34 meters. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage and the driver was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injuries as rated by police.
