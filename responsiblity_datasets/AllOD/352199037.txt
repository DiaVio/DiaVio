Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 63-year old, female driver, of a 2004 Ford Escape compact utility vehicle, which was primarily involved in a collision with a drainage ditch, with a subsequent rollover event. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the pre-noon hour (daylight), of a summer weekday, on a three-lane, bituminous roadway. This roadway forms the southbound travel direction of a north/south traffice way. The southbound roadway has a right turning curve leading into the crash area, as well as a slight uphill grade. There is a paved shoulder at the west edge of the road and a drainage ditch/culvert at the west roadside. The roadway has a speed limit of 55 mph (89 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2004 Ford Escape compact utility vehicle, was being operated by the 63-year old female driver (case occupant) in the right southbound travel lane. She intended to continue traveling southbound. At the time, the driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by her 3-point lap/shoulder belt (with buckle pretensioner) and the vehicle was equipped with redesigned frontal impact air bags. Crash: While traveling southbound, Vehicle 1 departed the west roadside edge. Vehicle 1 subsequently struck a mail box post with its frontal plane (event 1) before striking the drainage ditch/culvert with its frontal plane (low, including the undercarriage area / event 2). Due to the impact with the ditch/culvert, Vehicle rolled over (possible end-over-end) and impacted the ground/embankment with its top plane (hood and windshield header areas). Vehicle 1 rolled right down a localized embankment 2 quarter turns before coming to rest, on its wheels, facing a northerly direction, at the west roadside. Due to the impact with the drainage ditch/culvert, Vehicle 1's frontal air bags deployed and the driver's buckle pretensioner actuated. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was removed from the vehicle by responding emergency medical services personnel. She was transported, by air unit, to a local trauma center, but was subsequently transferred later in the day to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
