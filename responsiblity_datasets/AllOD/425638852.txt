This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 79-year-old female belted right front occupant with deployed airbags. She sustained serious injuries in a multi-event crash with a culvert and an embankment resulting in moderate damage to the case vehicle. The crash occurred during late afternoon daylight hours on a dry road under clear skies. A 2013 GMC Terrain compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was traveling east on a suburban highway with a 3% downhill grade. V1 was negotiating a right curve on this bituminous two-way, two-lane road. When traffic ahead stopped unexpectedly, V1swerved right in avoidance, departing the right side of the road. V1 traversed a shallow ditch before striking a concrete culvert in a dirt embankment with its undercarriage (Event 1). The ramp-like profile of the culvert area caused V1 to become airborne. V1 impacted another embankment with its left front wheel (Event 2). The impact caused V1 to roll left two quarter-turns (Event 3), damaging the top plane. V1 then rolled back one quarter-turn onto its left side, coming to rest on the embankment in the south roadside. V1 was towed due to damage. The 79-year-old female right front occupant was using a lap and shoulder belt. The available retractor and anchor pretensioners were not actuated. The vehicle was not equipped with a buckle pretensioner. The steering wheel hub, right top instrument panel, and both curtain airbags were deployed in the crash. The vehicle was not equipped with outboard side seatback airbags. This occupant was transported to a trauma center where she was treated for serious injuries sustained in the crash. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 79-year-old male belted driver. He was reported to be uninjured by police.
