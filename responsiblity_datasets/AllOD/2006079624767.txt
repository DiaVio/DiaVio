This two-vehicle collision occurred during late evening hours on a weeknight. It was dark, and overhead street lamps illuminated the crash scene. The crash occurred on a curved stretch of a dry, five-lane, two-way, undivided, bituminous, east-west roadway. The roadway is sloped slightly downhill for eastbound traffic. The right-most travel lanes are bordered on the outside by bicycle lanes in each direction, and posted signs prohibit parking along the curbs. The speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) in both directions. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Lexus ES350 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the second lane, curving towards its right. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Volkswagen Touareg 4-door hatchback, was stopped in the bike lane along the south curb. As V1 rounded the curve, it departed its lane to the left, crossed all travel lanes, and impacted V2 head-on. V1 rode up onto the raised curb, damaging its left front wheel, then rolled two quarter-turns towards its left side as it slid along the curb-line. V1 came to rest upside down partially off the roadway. V2 was knocked backward by the impact and entered the roadway, where it came to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The 43-year-old male driver of V1 could not be interviewed. He was unable to give a statement to police, but the police reported that an open container of beer was in the front of V1. Hospital staff took a blood sample at the behest of the police, the results of that blood test reported a BAC of 0.28. Medical records also indicate the driver takes no medications. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: This vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded: Driver-related decision error, too fast for curve/turn. Vehicle dynamics and witness statements on the police report indicate that V1 was traveling at a very high rate of speed.

The 39-year-old male driver of V2 refused to be interviewed. He reported to police that he was stopped along the roadside to receive a cell-phone call. He was just finishing the call and hanging up when he saw V1 coming toward him "at a high rate of speed." He was unable to take any evasive action. Medical records indicate the driver takes the medication Hyzaar. The critical precrash event for V2 was coded: Other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction - over left lane line. The critical reason for the event was not attributed to V2.
