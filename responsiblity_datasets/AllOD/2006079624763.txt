The single-vehicle crash occurred during dawn hours on a weekend. The crash occurred on a curved segment of a six-lane, positively divided, dry, uphill, concrete expressway. A concrete traffic barrier borders the left-most lane, and there is no shoulder between the barrier and the travel lane. The speed limit in the area of the crash is 105 kmph (65 mph). At the time of the crash it was cloudy, but there were no adverse atmospheric conditions. The roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Ford Focus ZX5 four-door hatchback, was traveling northbound in the sixth lane of the expressway, negotiating the rightward curvature. V1 departed the road to the left, where the front of V1 contacted the concrete barrier, causing damage down the left side. V1 deflected right and impacted the barrier again with its left side, then re-entered the travel lanes as it rotated clockwise. V1 came to rest in the fifth northbound lane, facing generally southeast. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

The 42-year-old female driver of V1 reported that at the time of the collision, she wanted to change lanes to the right - she felt uncomfortable in the sixth lane due to the proximity of the barrier. She was watching a vehicle to her right, which was passing her. She reported to police that she then took her attention away from the road to put out her cigarette in the ash tray. As she was doing so, the vehicle contacted the barrier. The driver reported to the researcher that she was not handling the cigarette, and that she hit a bump in the road, which caused her to lose control. She then refused all further questions.

The critical precrash event for V1 was: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded as a driver related factor: internal distraction.
