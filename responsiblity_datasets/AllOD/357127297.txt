The 185 cm (6'1"), 69kg (152lbs) 20-year-old male driver of the 2006 Chevrolet Colorado crew cab 4x4 pick-up truck was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He moved forward and inboard relative to the vehicle interior in response severe frontal-impact in a off-set to the right mode. The left eyebrow laceration, center forehead abrasion, right eyebrow avulsion, the 0.4cm left frontal lobe contusion and the subluxation at C1 and the chin laceration are probably due to contact with the rear view mirror reinforced by windshield header. The bilateral lung contusions, bilateral hemothorax, heart contusion, right hepatic vein laceration, suprahepatic inferior vena cava laceration w/ 2L of blood loss and the the right liver laceration (3-cm) are due to the center instrument panel. The right lateral leg contusion and the right calf abrasion are due to contact with the lower center instrument panel. The left shin contusion is due to contact the driver knee-bolster. The left elbow abrasion and abrasions on right hand are from an unknown source.
