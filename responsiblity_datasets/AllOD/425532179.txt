This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 27-year-old female belted driver with deployed side airbags. This occupant was driving a full-size five-door hatchback when she sustained serious injuries in a left plane near-side crash with a large pickup truck. The crash occurred late afternoon on a dry road under clear skies with a level grade. The case vehicle, a 2010 Mazda CX-9 full-size hatchback (Vehicle 1) was stopped facing south at the stop sign of a three-legged, T- intersection. A 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 large pickup (Vehicle 2) was traveling west in the right lane of a three-lane, two-way road approaching the same intersection. V1 began turning left as V2 proceeded straight through the intersection. The left plane of V1 was struck by the front plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 continued off the south edge of the intersection and struck a 10 cm diameter wooden post with its front plane (Event 2). V1 continued down an embankment before striking the ground with its front in a non-horizontal impact (Event 3), coming to rest off the south roadside. V2 came to rest in the road a short distance from the first impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was operated by a 27-year-old female driver. She was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The left curtain and left outboard seatback airbags deployed. The available steering wheel hub, right front instrument panel, and right side airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 3-month-old male second row right passenger in a child seat with no deployed airbags. He was reported to have minor injuries by police. The third row left seat was occupied by a 3-year-old female in a child seat with a deployed curtain airbag. She was also reported to have minor injuries by police.
