This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 46-year-old male unbelted driver with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant was driving a full size sedan when it was involved in a head-on full frontal collision to a large pickup truck. The case vehicle sustained severe damage. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred early afternoon in clear conditions on a dry road. A 2014 Lexus IS 250 full size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling southeast negotiating a right curve on a divided suburban road with one lane in each direction divided by a painted median. A 2011 Ford F-250 large pickup truck (Vehicle 2) was traveling northwest on the same road negotiating a left curve. The trafficway for V2's approach included a lane in each direction and an oncoming turn lane with no center divider. The road was level for both approaches. Vehicle 1 departed the lane to the left, crossed over a painted median, and entered the oncoming lane of travel. The front plane of V1 struck the front plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 was pushed back by V2 while rotating counter-clockwise approximately 120 degrees. Both vehicles came to rest in the road and were towed due to damage. The case vehicle was driven by a 46-year-old male unbelted driver. He was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by the belt being found in the unused, locked position at inspection due to retractor pretensioner actuation. No buckle or anchor pretensioners were installed. The steering wheel hub and left knee bolster airbags deployed in the crash. The left and right curtain airbags also deployed. The available right instrument panel and right knee bolster airbags did not deploy. The vehicle was equipped with outboard seat back airbags in the first and second rows which did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
