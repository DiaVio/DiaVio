This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 70-year old, female driver with non-deployed airbags. She sustained serious injuries in a nearside crash with a minivan. The crash occurred early afternoon in dry, clear weather. A 2010 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan (v1) was facing west attempting to turn left onto a suburban, bituminous, two-way, divided roadway. The grade was 7% downhill approaching the stop sign at the intersection. A 2003 Ford Windstar minivan (v2) was traveling north approaching the same intersection. V1 pulled out into the roadway and was impacted on its left front fender by the front plane of v2. V1 and v2 subsequently rotated into each other in a side-slap fashion such that the left rear quarter panel of v1 was struck by the right plane of v2. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 70-year old female case occupant who was restrained by lap and shoulder belt. The retractor pretensioners were not actuated and no airbags were deployed, including the available curtain and seatback airbags. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance. She was diagnosed with serious injuries and transferred to a local trauma center.
