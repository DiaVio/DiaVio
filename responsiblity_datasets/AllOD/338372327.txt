This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 23-year-old female right front belted passenger with a deployed curtain airbag. She sustained severe injuries in a multi-event crash that included near-side and rollover impacts. V1 was driven by a 27-year-old belted male with a non-deployed airbag who suffered minor injuries. The crash occurred midevening on a dry clear road. A 2005 Subaru Legacy intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling north negotiating a left curve. The road was rural bituminous two-way, two-lane with a 2% uphill grade. The curve was properly superelevated +3%. As V1 attempted to negotiate the left curve, it departed the right side of the road. V1 traveled a short distance on the grass roadside before re-entering the road. V1 then began a 90 degree counterclockwise yaw, traveling approximately 50 meters before departing the left side of the road. V1 impacted a stack of cinder blocks supporting a mailbox with its right plane (Event 1) and then began rolling over towards the right (Event 2). Just as V1 began rolling over, it struck a second stack of cinder blocks with its right plane (Event 3). V1 continued to roll 8 quarter turns over approximately 20 meters before impacting a tree with its right plane (Event 4). V1 came to rest on its tires at the point of impact with the tree and was towed due to damage. The 23-year-old female right front passenger was belted by a lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The right curtain airbag was deployed. The available front airbags, side seatback airbags, and left curtain airbag did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a trauma center where she was hospitalized for treatment of severe injuries.
