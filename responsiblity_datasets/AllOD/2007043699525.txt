This crash occurred on the right (west) roadside of a southbound, two-lane highway with a grass median. There were two southbound lanes on a level, straight grade. Conditions were daylight and wet with rain. The setting was the late morning hours of a weekday.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Mazda Tribute with one occupant, was southbound in lane two. As V1 continued southbound it began hydroplaning and traveled off the right side of the roadway. The front of V1 impacted two small trees. The tires of V1 stuck in the soft ground and V1 rolled left one-quarter turn and came to rest on its left side off the roadway to the right. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 21-year old male, was uninjured in the crash. He stated that he was heading to his boss' house when his vehicle lost control over a water puddle. He steered left in avoidance but was unable to regain control. His estimated travel and impact speeds were 113 kmph (70 mph).

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason was a driver related factor of traveling too fast for conditions (speeding on the wet roads). This driver was not licensed. He had been driving this class of vehicle for 8 months.

*Following the initial crash, traffic on this highway came to a stop for first responders to secure the scene. A heavy truck came over a hillcrest prior to the crash scene and did not recognize the stopped traffic. The heavy truck steered left to avoid rear-ending occupied cars. He traveled into the median and rear-ended an unoccupied vehicle at high speed. A separate crash report was created since this collision occurred 14 minutes after V1's crash.
