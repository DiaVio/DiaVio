This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 71 year old male driver of a 2001 Chevrolet Impala. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2001 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two-lane state rural paved road. Vehicle 2 was northbound on the same roadway. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline, into the path of Vehicle 2. The front left area of Vehicle 1 impacted the front left area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage. At this point, both vehicles rotated counterclockwise to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest across the travel lanes facing southeast. Vehicle 2 came to rest straddling the east pavement edge facing northwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital, and later transferred to a trauma center. The driver of Vehicle 1 was hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The case occupant was 180 cm (71 in) in height, and 84 kg (185 lbs) in weight. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
