This case involved the belted 38-year-old male driver of a passenger car responding to a narrow frontal impact with a steel sign/lamp post with frontal-impact air bag deployment. The twelve o'clock principal direction of force impact resulted in severe vehicle damage and serious injury to the subject. This single-vehicle crash occurred on a five-lane, divided, north/south trafficway traveling through an urban area. There were two lanes for travel in each direction and left turn pockets set within the raised median. There were steel sign/lamp posts (40cm at bumper level, 25 at hood) set into the median. The trafficway was straight and level. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the early morning (dark-street lights) weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (2005 Ford Mustang, 2-door hatchback) was traveling northbound. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal-impact air bags. The 38-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) had been using the belt restraint. The case vehicle traveled northbound in the number-two lane as it entered an uncontrolled intersection with a side street. Apparently, the fatigued driver allowed the vehicle to drift to the left, across the northbound left turn lane, through the intersection and into the southbound left turn lane. Evidence at the scene indicates that subject began braking as the vehicle mounted the raised curb. The vehicle continued forward in a locked wheel skid until striking the pole with its front center. The subject's frontal-impact air bag deployed. The vehicle rotated clockwise approximately 55-degrees as it sustained contact with the pole, which was not deformed. The vehicle came to rest against the pole facing northeast. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility with serious injuries to the right forearm, head and right lower extremity.
