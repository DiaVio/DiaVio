The driver was a 46-year-old female who had recently had knee surgery (a torn ACL) and was on hylan (an injection for swelling and pain), Xanax, and Wellbutrin, all of which have drowsiness and confusion listed as possible side effects. She was cited for running the red light.

The critical precrash event for vehicle #2 was other vehicle encroachment from Crossing Street, across path.
