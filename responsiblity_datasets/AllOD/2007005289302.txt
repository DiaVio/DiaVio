This two-vehicle crash occurred on a weekday at night on a two-way, two-lane roadway, which was not physically divided. The bituminous roadway was dry with a downhill grade and a right curve for eastbound traffic. There were no traffic control devices associated with this stretch of roadway. The posted speed limit was 40kmph (25mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Saturn Vue, was heading east on the roadway negotiating the right curve. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 GMC Van, was legally parked on the westbound roadway. Vehicle one lost control and crossed the opposing traffic lane. It then struck the legally parked vehicle, which was facing west. It continued on the left side of the road and rolled over onto its roof. While on its roof it struck a utility pole with the right side of the vehicle. It came to final rest off the edge of the roadway in the eastbound lane facing south. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The driver of V1, a 47 year-old female, suffered possible injuries and was taken to the hospital for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. After numerous attempts, an interview with this driver could not be obtained. For this reason, it is uncertain if any fatigue or health related issues contributed to this crash.
