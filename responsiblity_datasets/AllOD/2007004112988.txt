This crash occurred off the right side of an undivided two-lane north/south roadway near an intersection with an undivided two-lane east/west roadway. The east/west roadway ended at the north/south roadway in the eastbound direction. The eastbound lane was controlled by a stop sign; there were no traffic control devices for north/south traffic. All the roadways involved were dry, level, and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). The crash occurred in the early evening on a holiday weekday. Traffic flow was moderate.

V1, a 2005 Honda Civic 2-door coupe, was traveling east in lane one intending on making a left at the intersection. According to a surveillance camera that recorded the crash, V1 approached the intersection at a high rate of speed and failed to stop for the stop sign and proceeded through the intersection. The vehicle then departed the right side of the northbound roadway and struck a mailbox attached to a fence, went through a parking lot and struck another fence before spinning around and finally coming to final rest on the adjacent property. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, the Honda Civic, was driven by a 21-year-old male who reported no injuries but was checked out on scene by paramedics. The driver stated that he was heading home after visiting his family. He claimed that as he approached the stop sign he attempted to stop but his brakes were not functioning correctly and he was unable to stop in time and lost control of the vehicle. The driver stated also that there were other vehicles coming and he was not clear to proceed through the stop sign. He struck the two fences and mailbox and was finally able to get his car to stop when he lifted the emergency brake and put the car in reverse.

The Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as "inattention-thought focus unknown." This was coded because the driver was familiar with the intersection and knew that the cross street was usually congested but for some reason he was not focusing on the roadway and ran the stop sign. Police inspected V1 shortly after the crash and found no problem with the brakes. Associated factors coded to this driver include an illegal maneuver for failing to obey a traffic control device, traveling too fast to make the turn, and the use of an antidepressant medication.
