This is a single vehicle crash that occurred after dawn in daylight hours on a two lane, two way, rural, bituminous roadway with no traffic controls present. The roadway was straight, level and dry with a posted speed limit of 81 kmph (50 mph). It was early morning just after sunrise and the sky was clear and there was very limited traffic flow.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Jeep Wrangler soft top with a roll bar, driven by a 23 year-old male was traveling west in the number one lane. The roadway had one westbound and one eastbound driving lanes separated by a dashed lane line. V1 swerved right to avoid a oncoming vehicle, lost control, then crossed both travel lanes to the left and exited the roadway on the left. V1 collided with the dirt canal embankment and crossed the canal. It impacted the far embankment with the right front, and came to rest on the wheels facing generally northwest in the bottom of the canal. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1 stated he was traveling between 89-96 kmph (55- 60 mph) at the time and was going to work. He advised that he reached down to change a CD, took his eyes off the road, and when he looked up he saw a vehicle coming towards him. He stated that he steered hard right to avoid, over corrected and lost control of the vehicle. He stated that he was ejected from the vehicle.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason was a driver related factor: internal distraction. The driver stated that he took his eyes off the road, reached down to change a CD, looked up, steered left to avoid oncoming vehicle. Associated factors for V1 were excessive speed and inattention.
