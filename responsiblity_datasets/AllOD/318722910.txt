This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 26-year-old female belted driver of a subcompact hatchback with deployed curtain and seatback airbags. She sustained serious injuries in a multi-event crash culminating in a frontal impact to a large tree. The case vehicle sustained severe damage. The crash occurred during early morning daylight hours on a wet road under cloudy skies with fog, but no rain. A 2011 Ford Fiesta five-door subcompact hatchback (Vehicle 1) was traveling north on a two-way, two-lane rural road negotiating a right curve. The bituminous road was on a 3% downhill grade with 5% superelevation in the curve. V1 traveled left across the center line and then departed the left side of the road. V1 traveled a short distance before striking a large fallen tree, 60 cm in diameter, with its left plane and left rear wheel (Event 1). V1 continued and struck a small tree, 15 cm in diameter, with its front left corner (Event 2). V1 then traveled over a rock outcropping whereupon the undercarriage impacted a medium-sized boulder (Event 3). V1 then continued for a moderate distance before striking a large tree, 50 cm in diameter, with its front plane (Event 4). V1 came to rest at the point of impact with the large tree and was towed due to damage. The 26-year-old female driver was belted at the time of the crash as evidenced by 18 cm shoulder belt payout. The available retractor pretensioner did not show evidence of actuation, as the retractor operated normally at the time of inspection. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The left curtain airbag and left outboard seatback airbags deployed during the first event. The available steering wheel hub, left knee bolster, mid right instrument panel, and both right side airbags were not deployed in the crash. No other airbags were installed. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. No other occupants were in the vehicle.
