Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Ford F-150 pickup truck, was traveling south in lane one of a five lane, one-way limited access roadway under dry, dark conditions. For unknown reasons V1 departed the roadway to the right side. As V1 steered to the left to re-enter the roadway, the front right of V1 struck a light post. This impact caused V1 to return onto the roadway where it entered a counterclockwise rotation, crossed all five lanes and then struck a concrete barrier with its right rear corner then rotated CCW and impacted the barrier a second time with its left front wheel. V1 then came to final rest in lane one of the roadway facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 60-year-old male, sole occupant and case study occupant, was properly wearing his three-point lap and shoulder belt. No air bags deployed as a result of the crash. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
