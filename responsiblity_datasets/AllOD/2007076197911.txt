The vehicle then tripped, flipped and rolled 2 quarter turns coming to rest on its top facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a seventeen (17) year-old male, stated to police that he was traveling at 72 kmph (45 mph) and the truck began to slide as he rounded a corner hitting the berm then rolling. The father of the driver refused to allow his son to be interviewed and refused a vehicle inspection.
