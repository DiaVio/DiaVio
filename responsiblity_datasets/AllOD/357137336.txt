This case involves an oblique, front-end under-ride impact between a minivan and the side of a tractor/trailer combination. The 35-year-old female driver is the case occupant. She was restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag and the belt pretensioners did not deploy. The case vehicle, a 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan, was travelling in the inside northbound lane of a dry, concrete, five-lane road with an upgrade approaching the intersection of a private drive. Vehicle two (V2) a 2010 Freightliner Tractor/trailer was westbound on the intersecting driveway, turning left onto the roadway. The front-left corner of the case vehicle struck the left side of the trailer unit. The case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and came to rest with its hood under the trailer straddling the northbound lanes facing west-northwest. V2 came to rest straddling all four travel lanes facing southwest. It was dawn and clear. The 35-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She was restrained by a three point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag and the belt pretensioners did not deploy. She was 20 weeks pregnant at the time of the crash. She was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
