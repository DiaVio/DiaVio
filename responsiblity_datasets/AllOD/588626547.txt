Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a belted 22-year-old, female driver of a 2013 Nissan Versa 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a lower frontal plane impact with a concrete curb. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the post-midnight hours (dark, street lights present) of a late summer weekday, on a two-lane north/south roadway. This roadway has a negative grade for the southbound travel direction and, at the area of the crash, has a right turning curve. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The roadway has a speed limit of 25 mph (40 km/h) and the overall environment is commercial/industrial. Vehicle 1, the 2013 Nissan Versa 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 22-year-old female driver (case occupant) in the southbound travel lane, approaching the curved section of roadway from the north. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by her 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat-back mounted side air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the right turning curve and continue traveling south. Crash: As Vehicle 1 approached the right turning curve, it continued straight and traveled off the east edge of the roadway. At this time, Vehicle 1's lower frontal plane/undercarriage struck a concrete curb (event 1). Vehicle 1 subsequently struck the curb again with its left front, right front and left rear wheels (events 2 through 4) as well as its rear undercarriage area (event 5) as it continued traveling straight. Vehicle 1 traveled approximately 30 meters before coming to rest in a grass covered field, facing a southerly direction. As a result of the crash, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed and her seat belt pretensioner actuated. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was able to self-extricate herself from the vehicle and returned home. The case occupant sought medical treatment approximately 24 hours later at a local hospital and was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
