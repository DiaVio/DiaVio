This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 39-year old male driver of a 2007 Toyota Camry LE 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag and knee bolster air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a bridge (event 1 or 2). The case vehicle was also equipped with seatback mounted side air bags for the front outboard seating positions (non-deployed), and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions (non-deployed). Vehicle 1 was westbound on the inboard travel lane of a multi-lane urban roadway, and negotiating a right curve. It was dark (street lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. The east/westbound lanes were separated by a two-way left turn lane, to allow turning traffic access to local businesses. Within the (asphalt surfaced) straightaway, a bridge crossed a deep ravine. The bridge area was surfaced by concrete and bordered by thick barrier pillars. Vehicle 1 reached the end of the curve, and entered the straightaway. At this point, the driver allowed Vehicle 1 to depart the left (south) road edge, onto the bridge support wall. The left front wheel struck the concrete base, which resulted in moderate damage (event 1). The front left area subsequently impacted the barrier wall, resulting in severe damage (event 2). The offset frontal impact produced a counterclockwise rotation as Vehicle 1 re-entered the westbound travel lanes in a lateral motion. The combination of sudden vehicle rotation and lateral motion of the right side wheels against the concrete road surface tipped the center of gravity outboard of its wheels. This produced a roll moment, and initiated a 4-quarter turn right side rollover ("Trip-over"). This third and final event resulted in severe top damage to Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 came to rest upright (on its wheels) on the inboard westbound travel lane, facing southeast. Following the crash, the belted 39-year old male driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
