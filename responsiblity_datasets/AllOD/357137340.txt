The 75 kg (165 lbs); 168 cm (5'6") 15-year-old female driver of the 2009 four-door Mitsubishi Lancer was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. During the impact with the utility pole she moved forward and outboard relative to the vehicle interior and is presumed to have been flexed forward during the primary impact with the tree. The left periorbital contusion, the open depressed vault skull fracture, the base skull fracture and the fracture of the right midshaft clavicle are due to contact with the roof. The cerebral lacerations were caused by the depressed vault skull fracture. The left neck abrasion is probably due to the shoulder belt. The anterior mid torso contusion, the bilateral hemothorax, the hemomediastinem and the liver laceration are probably due to contact with the steering-wheel via the air bag. The comminuted, right distal femur fracture is due to contact with the knee bolster via the bolster air bag. The closed, dislocated left ankle fracture (NFS) is probably due to contact with the floor pan.
