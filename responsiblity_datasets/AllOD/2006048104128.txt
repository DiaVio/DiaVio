The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see. The driver stated that she has lost 40% of her hearing. She also stated that her view of V2 was obstructed by a building, a tree, and several parked vehicles. The scene inspection notes that those objects were present, but should not have caused a sightline issue for V2's approach. The driver looked, but did not see V2 prior to proceeding across the intersection.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path. Critical reason not coded to this vehicle.
