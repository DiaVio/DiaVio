This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday afternoon. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a six-lane, east-west, positively divided, bituminous expressway. The speed limit in the area of the crash is 105 kmph (65 mph), and the left-most lane is reserved for high occupancy vehicles. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects. Traffic forward of the collision area was congested.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Cadillac SLS 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound in the fifth lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Lexus SC300 2-door coupe, was ahead of V1 in the same lane. Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Toyota Tundra extended-cab pickup was behind V1 in the same lane. Vehicle four (V4), a 2004 Ford F-250 4X2 super-cab pickup, was ahead of V2 in the same lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.

Traffic slowed suddenly, and V1 veered left to avoid colliding with the back of V2. The front of V1 impacted the back of V2 in a sideswipe motion. The front of V3 then impacted the back of V1 in a sideswipe motion. V3 continued forward and struck the back of V2. V2 moved forward and impacted the back of V4.

The 81-year-old male driver of V1 reported that he was driving behind V2 when traffic unexpectedly slowed. He has a hearing aid but does not wear it. He attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering left into the HOV lane, but was unsuccessful. He stated that immediately after the first impact, he was struck from behind by V3, which continued forward and impacted V2. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: Other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded: Driver-related decision error, too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others (specified as: Forward traffic had stopped unexpectedly)". The driver also made a misjudgment of the speed and gap distance to the forward vehicle. Both rear tires of V1 were under-inflated.

The 67-year-old female driver of V2 was conversing with the passenger when traffic suddenly slowed ahead. She has a hyperopic (farsighted) condition but was not wearing her glasses at the time and does not have a restriction on her license. She stated that V4 stopped in front of her, and she came to a complete stop as well. The critical precrash event for V2 was coded: Other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed. The critical reason for the event was not attributed to V2.

The 29-year-old unlicensed male driver of V3 has six years of driving experience, and has received no driver's training. He and his passenger were listening to the radio. The driver stated that he was two car-lengths behind V1. When traffic suddenly slowed, he applied the brakes, but was unable to avoid a collision. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. This driver was following too closely because he did not realize caution was required. He made a false assumption and assumed that forward traffic would continue to proceed.
