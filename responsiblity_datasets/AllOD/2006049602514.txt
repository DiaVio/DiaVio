A single vehicle run-off-roadway crash happened on a weekday during evening hours. The location was a five-lane divided (with a positive barrier) straight highway. The first lane is an exit/entrance lane on the expressway. The roadway is sagging at the location where the driver lost control. The entire area experienced severe thunderstorms around the time of the crash. The asphalt roadway was wet, it is unknown if it was raining at the time. Water accumulated in the sag. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 96 kmph (60 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Ford Focus with two occupants, was traveling north in the fourth lane of the roadway. V1 drove through standing water and the driver lost control. The vehicle initiated a counter clockwise rotation as it departed over the left lane line, crossed lane five where the front struck the concrete median divider. The vehicle continued to rotate and the right rear struck the median barrier. V1 bounced off the barrier, crossed all lanes of traffic before it came to rest on the east shoulder facing northeast. The vehicle was towed from the scene and neither occupant was injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.

A 22-year old male was the driver of the vehicle. Due to language barrier, he was partially interviewed with the assistance of a wrecker driver on the scene. He moved to the area recently and was still in possession of an unknown out of state driver's license. He was able to describe how he hit a puddle of water on the roadway and lost control of his vehicle. He was heading into the direction of his residence, coming from an unknown location. A co-worker at the scene provided some information to police, indicating the driver works a full time job. No details about this job are known. The driver could not be further interviewed due to the fact he and his passenger spoke Spanish only. The researcher was not able to locate the driver for a possible in-person interview at his apartment complex.

The critical per-crash event was coded: this vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions (specified as: water puddle on roadway - roadway was the sag on a highway after/during rain). The critical reason was coded: too fast for conditions (specified as: too fast for slick roadway and accumulation of water on roadway). Inadequate drainage allowed water to accumulate on the traffic lanes, the vehicle probably hydroplaned and the driver lost directional control of the vehicle.
