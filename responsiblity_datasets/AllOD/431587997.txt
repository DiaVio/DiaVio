This case involves an 80-year-old female driver 165 cm (5'5") tall and weighing 56 kilograms (123 pounds). The case occupant was driving a 2002 Lexus RX300 involved in a moderate severity frontal crash with a tree. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. She was restrained with a three point seat belt with a retractor pretensioner that did actuate. The driver's seat position was equipped with steering wheel and seat back air bags, but only the steering wheel air bag deployed as a result of the collision. On impact, the case occupant moved forward in relationship to the car as evidenced by contacts on the knee bolster and steering wheel air bag, as well as loading marks on the seat belt. She sustained left 7th-12th rib fractures due to loading from the shoulder belt. There was also a T10 thoracic vertebral fracture attributed to axial loading of the spine through the pelvis with two points of contact from the lap belt and seat pan. Finally, she sustained a C5-C6 partial subluxation with paraplegia. This injury was considered to be due to forced extension of the c-spine from loading from the steering wheel air bag. She has severe preexisting degenerative changes of the spine which predisposed her to this injury.
