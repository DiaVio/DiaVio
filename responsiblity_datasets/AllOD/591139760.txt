This case involved the 39-year-old female driver of a pickup responding to a head-on collision with a passenger car. The vehicle sustained 'moderate' damage in the 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact, the subject's frontal-impact air bag deployed and the belted subject received serious injury. This two-vehicle crash occurred on a three-lane, north/south street traveling through a residential area. There was a single lane for travel in each direction separated by a continuous center turn lane. There was a slight hillcrest and the trafficway was straight through the crash site. The weather was clear and the bituminous trafficway dry during the early morning (dark-not lit), weekend crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2007 Chevrolet 1500 Silverado pickup, regular cab) was traveling south in the southbound lane. V1 was equipped with integrated lap and shoulder belts in the outboard positions, a lap belt in the center position and first row frontal-impact air bags. The 39-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1993 Honda Civic) was traveling northbound into the crash site carrying two occupants. V2 reportedly tracked, left, across the continuous turn-lane and into the path of V1 in the southbound travel lane. The front left of V1 struck the front left of V2. V1's steering-hub mounted frontal-impact air bag deployed. The vehicles rotated counterclockwise. V1 rotated approximately 40-degrees counterclockwise as it deflected to the right, and continued southwest for another few meters where it came to rest just off of the west roadside facing southeast. V2 rotated approximately 180-degrees as it continued forward, and to its left (northwest), coming to rest across the southbound travel lane facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (case subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
