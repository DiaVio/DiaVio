This single-vehicle rollover occurred during daylight hours on a weekday morning. The crash occurred on a straight, downhill stretch of a two-lane, north-south, divided, bituminous highway in the area of an entrance ramp. The speed limit in the area of the crash was 105 kmph (65 mph). At the time of the crash, ice was covering parts of the road surface; sunlight does not reach the road surface in the morning due to hills on the east roadside. The roadway was otherwise free of defects, and there were no other adverse weather conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Jeep Liberty compact SUV, was traveling northbound in the entrance ramp, coming onto the highway. After V1 merged onto the highway, V1 traversed an icy patch of road and lost traction. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and departed the road to the right side, where V1 tripped and rolled seven quarter-turns towards its right side. V1 came to rest on the roadside with its left plane in contact with the ground. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

The 18-year-old female driver of V1 was traveling to school with a 16-year-old male passenger. They were conversing and listening to the radio prior to the crash. The driver reported that she was rested and in good health at the time of the crash. She stated that after the vehicle lost traction on the ice, she tried to regain control by braking and steering left, but was unsuccessful. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: This vehicle loss of control due to poor road conditions (ice). The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1 and was coded: Driver related decision error, too fast for conditions (ice).
