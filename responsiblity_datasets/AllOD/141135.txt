Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 GMC unknown model van was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. An unknown non-contact vehicle (NCV) was also traveling west and was in front of V2. The driver of the non-contact vehicle intended to turn left at the T-intersection but V2 began began to overtake the NCV and passed the NCV on the left while entering the intersection area. The driver of V1 steered left in an attempted avoidance maneuver but was unable to avoid being struck by V2. The front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset frontal configuration. V1 rotated clockwise and departed the southwest corner where it came to rest facing south-southwest. V2 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest in the southbound lane of the T-intersection facing south-southwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 49-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She sustained severe injuries (AIS-4) and was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
