This case involves a belted driver responding to a frontal, off-set right, impact with a rigid object and frontal impact air bag deployment. This single vehicle crash occurred on a two lane, two-way, trafficway in a rural setting. The north/south trafficway had a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. There was a negative grade for southbound traffic. The southbound approach to the crash site was straight and then curved left just at the point of roadway departure. The weather was cloudy but the bituminous roadway was dry during the afternoon, weekend crash. The case vehicle, a 1997 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was traveling southbound. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and driver and passenger frontal Impact air bags. The 72-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as evidenced by friction burning of the webbing attributed to occupant loading during the crash. The subject was negotiating the downward grade and approaching a left curve in the roadway. The subject did not negotiate the left curve and drove off of the right (west) roadside where the front right of her vehicle struck a large, non-yielding, boulder. The vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact deflected the vehicle to the left (east) across the northbound lane and off of the east side of the roadway. The front of the vehicle struck an upward embankment with its front left and came to rest facing the embankment. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility with serious injuries.
