This crash occurred at night on a two lane, two way highway with clear, dry conditions and a speed limit of 55 mph/89 kmph. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Hyundai Accent, was southbound when a deer ran into the road from the left. The driver of V1 swerved right and began to rotate clockwise and departed the roaway to the right. V1 dropped laterally down into a ditch and then into muddy field with small crops. The left side tire gouged into the mud along with the rear of the vehicle with the tail pipe found later in this location. V1 then began to roll to the left multiple times with the driver's door coming open during the roll over. The vehicle came to rest on its roof some distance into the field. The driver, case occupant, a 19 year old male, was lap and shoulder belted and no airbags deployed. The driver remained in the vehicle but evidence suggests that the driver side impacted the ground after the door opening occurred. The driver was transported to the trauma center and the vehicle was towed.
