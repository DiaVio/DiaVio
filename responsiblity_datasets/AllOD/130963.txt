Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Jeep Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural highway and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4-door sedan was traneling south in the southbound lane of the same roadway and was approaching the same intersection. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. As both vehicles approached the intersection, the driver of V2 moved into the northbound lane in an attempt to turn left. The driver of V1 was not able to take any avoidance manuevers and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal mode. On impact, V1 began to rotate counterclockwise and moved onto the east shoulder where it tripped over its right side wheels, rolled 4-quarter turns, and came to rest on its wheels partially off the road, facing west-northwest. V2 was forced rearward while rotating counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees and came to rest in the southbound lane facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 55-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The 54-year-old female right-front passnger of V1 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. Both were transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. The driver and right-front passenger of V2 were also transported to a regional level-one trauma center and were hospitalized with unknown injuries. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage.
