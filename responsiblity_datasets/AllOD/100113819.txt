This case involved the belted, 26-year-old pregnant driver of a compact passenger car responding to a light, frontal (offset right) impact with the front of another passenger car without air bag deployment. The driver sustained minor injuries. This two-vehicle crash occurred at a controlled, four-way intersection in a residential/commercial area. The north/south trafficway was straight and had two lanes for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. There was a gradual grade decline from north to south. The intersecting two-lane east/west street was straight and level. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadways dry during the dusk, weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2000 Plymouth Neon, 4-door sedan) was traveling northbound in the number-two (left) lane, and uphill, on its approach to the intersection. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 26-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2001 Kia Optima, minivan) was traveling southbound in the number-one lane, downhill and straight on its approach to the intersection. The driver was the sole occupant of V2. The driver of V1 (subject) began to negotiate a left-turn at the intersection, bringing it into the path of V2. The front right of V1 struck the front of V2. The impact rotated V1 counterclockwise until the right side of V1 struck the left side of V2 (side-slap). V1 came to rest on the southwest corner facing southwest. Its frontal impact air bags did not deploy. V2 came to rest in the intersection within the proximity of the second impact facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene and both drivers were transported to medical facilities.
