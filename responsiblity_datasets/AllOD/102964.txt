It was daylight, the sky was cloudy and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 experienced a syncopal episode due to a medical condition and fell unconscious. The right-front passenger of V1 attempted to taked control of the vehicle from the right-front seat but was not able to control the vehicle. V1 departed the right side of the raod, crossed a sidewalk and struck a tree with the left-front bumper of V1. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 80-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 79-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
