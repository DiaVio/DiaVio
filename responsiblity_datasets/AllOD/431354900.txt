This frontal crash involves a 23 year old unrestrained male seated in the front left (Driver) seating position with deployed steering wheel air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred in the afternoon hours in wet and rainy weather. The collision occurred on a level two lane divided (without positive barrier) bituminous trafficway that curves to the right. There were two northbound travel lanes and two southbound travel lanes. There are no traffic control devices for each direction. The case vehicle (V1), a 2004 four-door Ford Crown Victoria, was being driven northbound at the time of the crash. V1 was traveling northbound in the right lane and as it entered a right curve the driver lost control on the wet roadway, traveling into the left lane and then traveling back across both northbound lanes and off the northbound road edge impacting a tree with its front end. After initial impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise impacting its right fender with a second tree. This was V1's final resting position. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 23 year old male case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was not restrained by the available 3-point manual restraint. The retractor type pretensioner did actuated as a result of the crash. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed but the seat back mounted air bag did not. This case occupant's seat was positioned between the middle and rear most position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was injured in the crash and transported by ground ambulance to a level 1 trauma center for treatment of his injuries.
