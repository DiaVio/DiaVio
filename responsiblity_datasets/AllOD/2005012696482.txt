V1 a 2001 Pontiac Aztec was traveling westbound on a five lane, two way, snow covered, asphalt roadway in daylight conditions approaching an intersection controlled by a control signal without pedestrian signals. V1 was traveling between18-32kmph (11-20mph) in lane one intending to continue straight, through the intersection. A non-contact vehicle slammed on his brakes at the green light ahead of them. V1 did not expect this so he attempted to avoid hitting him by turning right onto an adjacent street. V1 was going too fast for the turn and contacted its left side to a curb before coming to final rest on the roadway.

The driver of V1 was a 52-year old male with a history of Crones Disease and high blood pressure for which he took medication (that was not believed to have contributed to the crash). He was rested and traveling to pick up a co-worker. He was wearing his prescribed lenses that corrected a myopic (near-sighted) condition. He was uninjured and refused treatment. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle loss of control due to poor road conditions, icy. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a decision error, following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, because he could not avoid hitting the vehicle in front of him so he attempted a lane change.
