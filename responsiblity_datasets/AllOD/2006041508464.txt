The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, ten-lane interstate roadway, divided by a concrete barrier wall. There were five southbound lanes. This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was sporadically congested due to rush-hour traffic.

V1 veered to the left to avoid rear-ending the vehicle in front of him. V1 drove off the roadway to the left. The front of V1 made contact with the concrete barrier wall. After impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise as it reentered the roadway. V1 came to final rest between lanes four and five, facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

The Toyota 4-Runner was driven by a 27-year old male, who refused treatment. The driver declined to be interviewed.
