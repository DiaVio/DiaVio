Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Hyundai Tucson, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and traversing a negative (downhill) grade. It was daylight, snowing with blowing snow, and the bituminous road surface was snow-covered and slippery. The driver of V1 departed the right-side of the road due to poor visibility. The front of V1 struck a mailbox mounted on a cedar post, a second mailbox mounted on a metal post and a double-leg traffic sign, knocking down all of these objects. The driver of V1 attempted to return to the road by braking and steering left, but the deep snow caused V1 to enter a slight counter-clockwise yaw. The right side of V1 then struck a utility pole (with a metal box mounted to the front on the struck side of the pole) where it reportedly came to rest facing north-northeast. V1 was towed although the vehicle was probably driveable. Seat belt use by the 77-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was questionable and thus coded as unknown, but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a level-one trauma center where she was hospitalized and treated for her injuries. No other occupants were present in V1.
