Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier Z24, 2-door coupe was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural raodway. It was daylight, the skies were clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 noticed a small animal in the road (previously killed cat in reality) and swerved to the right to avoid striking the animal and left the right side of the road. V1 traversed a shallow ditch and entered a private lawn. The right side of V1 struck a tree in a swiping type collision. V1 continued north across the lawn and began a slight counterclockwise yaw as the driver attempted to return to the road by steering left. V1 then struck a second tree with the front bumper while in a slight counterclockwise yaw. V1 rotated counterclockwise around the tree approximately 30 degrees and came to rest. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damge. The 18-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
