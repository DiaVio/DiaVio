This crash occurred on the roadside of a two-lane undivided roadway. There was one westbound lane and one eastbound lane with a posted speed limit of 56KMPH (35MPH). The crash occurred on a bituminous downhill (-11.4 percent grade) left hand curve. It was early evening and the road edges were covered in ice and snow and snow was blowing across the road surface. It was dark out and the road was unlit. Traffic flow was light.

V1, a 1998 Neon 4-door sedan with one occupant, was traveling west. As the operator tried to negotiate the left curve, he lost control and went sliding off the road edge and into a utility pole. The pole snapped and fell onto the road blocking both lanes. The vehicle came to rest on the roadside at the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

V1 was driven by a 19 year-old male who reported no injuries. The driver stated that he was on his way to a friend's house and lost control on the icy road.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was "Slick roads," an environmental factor. As per the police report and scene investigation, there were slushy spots on the road that were mixing with the snow that was falling at the time of the crash. A second roadway related factor was coded as an associated factor - "Roadway geometry (curve)." This was coded because the measured radius of curvature was 81 meters. For a curve with a superelevation of 10 percent and a posted speed of 35 mph, the radius of curvature should be greater than 97 meters. Therefore, this curve had a roadway deficiency. Other associated factors that were coded include incorrect evasive action, traveling too fast for conditions, the slick roadway, and the weather (blowing snow).
