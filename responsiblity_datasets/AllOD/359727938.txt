This case occupant is an 84 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a moderate frontal pole impact followed by multiple tree impacts. His frontal air bag deployed and he sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with overcast weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Kia Sorento compact utility vehicle, was southbound in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway. This roadway is comprised of straight asphalt travel lanes bordered by paved shoulders and there is a slight uphill grade for southbound vehicles. While traveling south, V1 drifted out of its lane, crossed the center lane lines and traveled off the left side of the roadway. V1 continued traveling south across grass and mulch until the front of V1 impacted a utility pole on the east side of the roadway, breaking it off its base and resulting in the actuation of V1's driver side seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the case occupant's steering column mounted frontal air bag. V1 continued south and an overhanging tree branch swiped V1's front left quarter panel and A-pillar, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued south and then its front right impacted a tree, resulting in moderate sideswipe-type damage. V1's front left then impacted two trees, resulting in moderate damage. V1 came to final rest wedged between the trees, facing southeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, an 84 year old male, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the first crash event. This driver sustained serious injuries and was taken to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. He was hospitalized for seventeen days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
