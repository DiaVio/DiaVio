This case involved the 29-year-old restrained male front right passenger of a 2006 Chrysler Town and Country Van (V1). The case subject was restrained by the available manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. The only other occupant of V1 was the driver, a 27 year old female who was also restrained by the manual 3 point safety belt and a deployed frontal airbag. There were no other vehicles involved in the crash. The crash occurred at night on an unlit interstate highway at an exit ramp. The asphalt road was dry and the weather was clear. There was a 2% downhill grade and the ramp curved to the right. The posted speed limit for the interstate highway was 113 kph (70 mph). V1 was southbound in the right lane of the two southbound lanes exiting onto an interchange ramp. As V1 traveled at an unknown speed on the ramp, it departed the right side of the road and traveled down an embankment. V1 struck a ditch with its frontal plane and came to rest on the other side of the ditch still facing south. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The front right passenger (case subject) of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital. Due to the serious nature of his injuries, he was later transferred to a level one trauma center and hospitalized. The driver of V1 was uninjured and required no medical treatment.
