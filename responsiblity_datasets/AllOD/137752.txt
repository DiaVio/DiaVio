Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 GMC Canyon, 2-door regular cab pickup pulling an empty single axle trailer was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of four-lane, divided, limited-access freeway (two lanes eastbound, protected median, two lanes westbound). It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 lost control and V1 veered to the left, crossed the left eastbound lane and entered the left shoulder area. The driver of V1 steered right, re-entered the road, crossed both lanes and the front of V1 struck a concrete bridge rail. The impact caused V1 to be redirected in a east-northeasterly direction and V1 tripped over its right side wheels and rolled two quarter turns coming to rest on its in the right eastbound lane. During this sequence the trailer separated from V1 and came to rest on its wheels on the right shoulder. The 76-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate injuries. The 56-year-old male right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt with a belt extender and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor injuries (ISS-2). The case vehicle was towed due to disabling vehicle damage.
