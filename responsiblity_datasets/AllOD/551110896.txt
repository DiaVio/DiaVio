This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Dodge Durango, was southeast on a two lane, two way street that curved north to the left with a slight downgrade. The posted speed limit was 35 mph/56 kmph. V1 was passing overtaking another vehicle and in the opposite lane as it entered the curve. V1 began to brake in the curve returning to the lane, but then departed the roadway to the right on the shoulder and struck a sign post with the front. V1 continued to depart off the road down a very steep embankment with a down grade of 37 percent. V1 then struck the front right into a tree that rotated V1 clockwise. With V1 angled downward on the embankment the top left A-pillar and roof contacted a second tree just before the left side back quarter panel impacted a third tree in a non-horizontal direction. V1 continued to rotate clockwise off this tree, still angled downward on the slope allowing the right side lower sill to impact a fourth tree. V1 then pivot around this fourth tree on to the left side and then on to its roof before flipping back upright on the tires at final rest facing east on the down grade of the slope. V1 was totalled and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who is a 16 year old male wearing the lap/shoulder belt with the frontal airbag deploying. No other passengers were in V1. The case occupant was extricated from the vehicle and transported to the trauma center.
