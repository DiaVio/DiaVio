Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, 2-door coupe was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way residential street. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. As V1 was traveling south, the driver recognized his speed was too great for the curve he was entering and he began to brake and steer to the right. V1 began a clockwise yaw as it departed the left side of the road. V1's yaw increased as it traveled off the road until the left side of V1 struck a 20-cm diameter tree stump in an oblique manner. This impact caused V1 to trip over and begin a left-side leading roll. The one-quarter turn roll was interrupted when the top of V1 struck two trees, a 46-cm diameter tree struck across the top of the cowl and windshield area and a 10-cm diameter tree struck across the front portion of the roof. V1 came to rest on it's left side, against these two trees facing west-northwest. The 23-year-old male driver (case occupant) of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. The driver extricated himself and walked a short distance to his residence, from which he was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
