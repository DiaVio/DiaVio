This case involves a 64 year old male driver 183 cm (72 inches) tall and weighing 109 kg (241 lbs). The case occupant was driving a 2009 GMC Sierra 4-door pickup that was involved in a minor right side impact with a 2011 Chevrolet Impala followed by a severe two quarter rollover arrested by a light post. The principal direction of force during the side impact was 70 degrees followed by non-horizontal rollover and arrested roll events. The driver was restrained by the three point manual belt. The steering wheel mounted frontal air bag did not deploy during the crash. As a result of the extensive roof intrusion during the rollover arrest, the head loaded the roof resulting in the left parietal scalp contusion, C6 lamina fracture and C5 facet fracture. The contact and the injury causation were coded as certain. The roof intrusion was critical to the injury causation contact. The cervical spine injury further resulted in the right sided vertebral artery occlusion causing cerebral infarction which led to the death of the victim. Additionally, the occupant also sustained right sided rib fractures (ribs 4 through 7), bilateral pulmonary contusions, and a left pneumothorax. The chest injuries were caused by loading of the chest by the manual belt during the rollover event.
