This one vehicle crash occurred early evening on a two-way road during clear nighttime conditions. The road is undivided and runs north and south with no control devices. There is a road that runs east from the two-way road, and a series of drive ways that go into a factory on the west side of the road, but neither of these played a role in the crash. The speed limit of the north/south road is 50 kmph (30 mph). Parallel parking is allowed on both sides of the street.
