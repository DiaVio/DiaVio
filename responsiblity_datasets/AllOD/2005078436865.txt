The driver stated that she was not paying attention because she was thinking about all the homework she had to do over the weekend. The driver slammed on her brakes (no lock up) when she realized that the light was going to stay red. V1 traveled into the intersection and the front of V1 struck the right side of vehicle two V2. V1 came to a controlled stop in the northbound bicycle lane to the north of the intersection facing in a northerly direction. The driver of V1 had been driving for 2 hours prior to the crash and worked the day of the crash. The driver left work and drove to visit family out of town and then drove back home and got into a crash about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from home. The vehicle was not towed due to damage.

V2, a 1998 Honda Accord LX 4 door, was traveling southbound approaching the intersection in the #2 lane. The vehicle entered the left turn lane on a green arrow and proceeded into the intersection to make a left turn to travel eastbound. The driver of V2, an 18-year old male with one passenger, stated that he saw V1 approaching from the south and assumed the vehicle was going to stop for the red light. The driver of V2 stated that when he realized that V1 was not going to stop, he accelerated while making the left turn to avoid being struck by V1. The right of V2 was struck by the front of V1. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise traveling in a southeasterly direction. The vehicle came to rest in the intersection facing in a southeasterly direction. The vehicle was towed due to damage.
