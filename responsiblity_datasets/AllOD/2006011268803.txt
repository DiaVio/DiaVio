This crash occurred in the early afternoon of weekday on a fully controlled, two-way, divided (with concrete median barrier), urban highway. The two bituminous westbound lanes, where the crash occurred, were straight with a negative grade greater than 2% and a posted speed limit of 113kmph (70 mph). Traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric factors at the time of the crash.

V1, a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer, was westbound in lane two traveling near the speed limit. A non-contact vehicle was traveling in lane one slightly behind V1. As the non-contact vehicle encroached into V1's lane V1 swerved to the left onto the paved shoulder with a rumble strip, and successfully avoided contacting the other vehicle. V1 then over steered as it attempted to reenter the roadway and began to rotate counter- clockwise. V1 rotated across the two traffic lanes and departed the roadway to the right where it slid down the grassy ditch and rolled over two quarter turns. V1 came to final rest on its top, facing south. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was driven by an 18 year-old male who was on his way home after a court appearance. He stated that a passenger yelled to him that a vehicle in lane one was passing them and was now attempting to cut into V1's lane, which would cause them to collide. The driver of V1 stated that he was able to avoid that collision but he overcorrected when he attempted to reenter the roadway. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. The fully restrained driver and two male occupants denied any injuries.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related factor, overcompensation. In addition to the overcompensation, driver inexperience was coded as an associated factor as the driver had only been driving for two years and driving that class of vehicle for even less (1 year).
