This case involves single vehicle right side crash event initiating a rollover resulting in severe injuries to the driver. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Saturn Ion 4-door sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lane on lane two of a two-lane roadway. The trafficway is a two-way four lane road divided by a wide median with trees. The collision occurred on the west bound downgrade dry roadway at night with no adverse weather conditions. The speed limit of the roadway is 64 km/h (40 mph). The crash occurred when V1 lost control after passing through the intersection. V1 entered the median with counter clockwise rotation and the right side plane of V1 impacted a tree (~28 cm diameter). Upon impact V1's occupant compartment rolled two quarter turns before coming to final rest on its roof in the median. The frontal axle along with the engine separated from the vehicle due to the impact with the tree and was found 100 feet away from the rolled vehicle. The passenger compartment was on its roof and was facing east on the median at the final rest position and the engine was facing east on the westbound roadway. The 21-year-old male driver of V1 (Case Occupant) was unbelted and both the frontal driver (steering wheel mounted) and passenger (mid mount- instrument panel) air bags deployed. The 21-year-old male was airlifted to the nearest trauma center because of his severe injuries.
