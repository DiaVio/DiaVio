Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Kia Spectra, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road in a rural area. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reported that a deer began to enter the road from the right and she steered left, then right and avoided the animal but lost control of her vehicle and it entered a clockwise yaw. V1 departed the right side of the road and the left side of V1 obliquely struck a double-trunk tree. V1 stopped its clockwise rotation and rotated counterclockwise around the tree and came to rest in an agricultural field facing east-northeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 53-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
