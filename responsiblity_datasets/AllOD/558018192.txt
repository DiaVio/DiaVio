The case vehicle, a 1997 Buick Century, was traveling southbound on a two-lane roadway. It was daylight and the roadway was dry. Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Lincoln Town Car was traveling southbound, in the same lane, behind the case vehicle at a higher speed. Vehicle three (V3), a 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix was traveling northbound on the same roadway approaching the case vehicle. As V2 closed on the case vehicle, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid a collision by veering to the right and passing the case vehicle on the shoulder. V2 struck the right side of the rear of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to enter a counterclockwise rotation and cross the center-line. The case vehicle entered the path of V3. V3 struck the case vehicle on the right-rear door. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise before it came to a rest on the roadside, approximately 20 feet from the second point of impact.

The 75-year-old male driver was wearing a lap and shoulder belt. The 14-year-old female center-rear passenger was wearing a lap belt. The 12-year-old female right-rear passenger was wearing a lap and shoulder belt. All three case occupants were taken to a local hospital prior to being transferred to a level-one trauma center.
