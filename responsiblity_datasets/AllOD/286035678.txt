Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was a 2003 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan. The driver was the only occupant in the vehicle. V1 was traveling northbound in the left lane of a four lane divided highway. The highway was wet and it was raining at the time of the crash. The crash occurred when V1 braked (no lockup) and steered to the right to avoid traffic in front. The driver lost control and traveled off the right edge of the roadway. V1 traveled up an embankment and rolled counter-clockwise two quarter turns before coming to final rest on its roof. The 35 year old male driver (case occupant) was wearing his available lap and shoulder belt. This vehicle was equipped with frontal air bags which did not deploy in the crash. The driver was airlifted from the scene and taken to a local trauma center for treatment of his injuries.
