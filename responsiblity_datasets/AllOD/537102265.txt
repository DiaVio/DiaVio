Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, 5-door hatchback was traveling north in the northbound lane of a three-lane, two-way rural roadway (one lane northbound, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Pontiac Vibe, 5-door utility vehicle was traveling south in the left southbound lane of the same road. It was dark, snowing, and the bituminous road was snow-covered. The driver of V2 reportedly lost control on the icy road and crossed the centerline. The driver of V1 could not avoid the collision and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 at an oblique angle. Both vehicle were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 43-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt, the steering-wheel airbag deployed, and the left side curtain airbag deployed. The 41-year-old female right-front passenger was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. The 7-year-old male left-rear passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and the left side curtain airbag deployed. All three occupants of V1 were transported to a regional level-one trauma center and all were treated and released.
