This 74-year-old female (170cm/64kg, 5'7"/141lbs) was the front right passenger of a 2002 Toyota Avalon four-door sedan that was involved in a moderate severity frontal impact followed by multiple minor impacts, and a minor rollover event near final rest. The frontal impact was at 11 o'clock direction of force at 330. She was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt and during the frontal impact her belt retractor pretensioner actuated and the frontal instrument panel mounted air bag deployed. During the frontal impact her body moved forward and inboard. The seat belt webbing had loading evidence from restraining her torso. Her buttocks loaded the seat cushion and deformed the inboard side downward. Her right knee contacted and scuffed the glove box. This patient sustained bilateral rib fractures (right 7-9 and left 7-9) and a large hematoma adjacent to the descending colon. The rib fractures were attributed to compression from the shoulder belt and the abdominal hematoma from the lap belt portion. A contributing factor for the abdominal injuries was due to the submarining and deformation of the seat cushion.
