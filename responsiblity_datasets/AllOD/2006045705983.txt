The crash occurred on a four-lane north/south state highway divided by a grass median (two lanes in each direction). South of the crash location, a guardrail divided the roadway; however, the guardrail ended prior to the crash location and the road was divided by a grass median with a concrete drainage ditch. The northbound lanes were curved to the right with a measured radius of 563 meters. There was a negative 5 percent grade in the northbound direction with a superelevation of 6 percent. There was a downhill slope of 17 percent off the left side of the road into the drainage ditch. The speed limit on the highway was 89 kmph/55 mph. The crash occurred in the early morning on a weekend under daylight and dry conditions.
