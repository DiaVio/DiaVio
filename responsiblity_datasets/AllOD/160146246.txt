This rollover crash involves a 21-year-old restrained male driver with no air bag deployment who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred under dry, dark conditions. The collision occurred on a two lane, two way roadway with an uphill grade and divided by a solid double line. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer utility vehicle and was being driven east. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, entered the westbound lanes of the roadway. The driver of V1 attempted to steer right to correct and drove off the roadway on the right side while entering a clockwise yaw. After departing the roadway, V1 drove over the edge of a steep embankment and struck a tree with its left side. After striking this tree, V1 rolled over down the embankment to the right side two quarter-turns where it struck another tree with its left front. V1 came to final rest at the bottom of the embankment on its roof. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 21-year-old male case occupant who was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had no air bag deployment. There was also a 21-year-old female occupant in the right front seat who was restrained by the available lap and shoulder belt. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
