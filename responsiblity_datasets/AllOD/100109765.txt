This case involved a belted driver responding to a frontal, off-set left impact with a tree. This single vehicle crash occurred on the eastbound side of a trafficway with alternating center turn lane and raised curb medians. There were five lanes for traffic just prior to the crash site with two lanes for travel in each direction and a continuous left turn lane. At the point of occurrence there were two lanes for travel in each direction divided by a raised curb median. The median held several trees of varying size. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the evening (dark-street lights), weekday crash. The case vehicle, a 2002 Chevrolet Venture, was traveling eastbound in the number-two lane (left). The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The 77-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as demonstrated by physical evidence. The driver (subject) allowed the vehicle to drift off of the roadway, to the left (north) at a gradual angle and onto the raised curb median. The front of the vehicle first struck down a small landscaping tree and then struck a large, split-bout, tree with its front left. The impact caused the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise slightly, rebound away from the tree and come rest facing northeast with close proximity. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The driver (subject) of the vehicle was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury(s).
