There are two case study occupants, an 81-year-old restrained male driver and a 73-year-old restrained female passenger who were involved in a frontal collision in a 2003 Mercedes-Benz E320 sedan. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mercedes Benz E320 sedan, was traveling south in a parking lot under dry, daylight conditions. For unknown reasons, V1 went off the road to the left where it struck the corner of a parked 2003 Nissan Xterra utility vehicle with its front and then struck the left side of a parked 2005 Toyota Matrix sedan with its front. V1 came to rest in the roadway and was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 81-year-old male and case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deploy. The right front passenger of V1, a 73-year-old female and also a case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deploy. B-pillar mounted pretensioners fired in both vehicles as well. Both occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
