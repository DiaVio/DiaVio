This case involved a 36 year old restrained female driver of a 2010 Mazda 6 four door sedan (V1). The driver was restrained by the 3-point manual safety belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. V1 was involved in a sideswipe type impact with a 2002 Kia Spectra 4 door sedan (V2) followed by an impact with a tree stump and a one quarter turn rollover. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane residential asphalt roadway. The road curved to the right and had a 7% downhill grade for the southbound traffic. The roadway was dry under cloudy conditions. The posted speed limit was 48 kph (30 mph). V1 was traveling south when it crossed the center line and struck the left side of V2 with its left front corner. V1 continued southbound and departed the left side of the roadway. V1 traveled 39 meters on the roadside before striking a tree stump with its frontal plane. V1 overrode the stump and rolled one quarter turn to the left for final rest. There was a small electrical fire contained in the lower right instrument panel that resulted in minor damage. V2 came to rest forward and to the right of impact with V1. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized.
