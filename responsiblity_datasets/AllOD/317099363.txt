This case involved a 74 year old restrained female driver of a 2005 Lincoln Town Car 4 door sedan (V1). The driver, and only occupant of V1, was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag as well as a deployed left seat mounted side impact airbag. V1 impacted an embankment followed by a three quarter turn rollover. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a divided interstate highway. The dry asphalt roadway was straight with a 3% uphill grade. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. V1 was going north reportedly traveling at the posted speed limit of 113 kph (70 mph) in left lane of the two northbound lanes. V1's left side tires drifted over the left lane line and onto the west shoulder of the road. The driver of V1 overcorrected to the right and began to skid in a clockwise yaw. V1 departed the right side of the roadway and impacted an embankment with its front. V1 slid upward and across the embankment before rolling onto its left side at the bottom of the embankment. V1 continued rolling onto its top and then the right side for final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was airlifted to a level one trauma center due to the severity of her injuries.
