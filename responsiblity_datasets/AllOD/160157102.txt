The focus of this case is on an 18-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2009 Honda Civic (V1), involved in two off road side impact crashes with trees, one to each side of V1. This single vehicle collision occurred during the early evening hours (light), of an autumn weekend day (Sunday), on a winding and hilly stretch of east/west roadway. The east/west roadway was a non divided two lane bituminous. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for the roadway is 48 km/h (30 mph). V1 was reported on the PAR to be traveling 96 km/h (60 mph) just before the crash. The 18-year old male driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the eastbound travel lane. He was wearing his 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag. Two other non-case occupants were in the vehicle in the front right and 2nd row right seating positions (positions 13 and 23). V1 crested the hill at a high rate of speed (60 mph), lost control and departed the roadway continuing to travel east as the roadway turned to the northeast. The right side plane of V1 impacted a tree causing V1 to rotate clockwise. The left side plane of V1 then contacted a second tree and came to rest against the tree. The top of the second tree broke off approximately 2 meters above ground level as a result of the impact. The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by air rescue, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. All other occupants were transported to a local medical facility. The extent of their injuries and/or treatments is unknown. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
