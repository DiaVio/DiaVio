Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Mercury Cougar, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was wet. The driver and right-front passenger both reached to the floor to retrieve an object that fell and the vehicle departed the right roadside. V1 travelled a short distance along a low ditch and the front of V1 struck a 40-cm diameter tree where it came to rest against the tree. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 17-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries to an unspecified hand. The 17-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
