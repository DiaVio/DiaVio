This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 40-year-old, female driver with deployed frontal airbags (V1). This occupant sustained moderate injuries in a head-on collision with V2. The 45-year-old male driver of V2 sustained police-reported non-incapacitating injuries. The crash occurred early evening on a wet, unlighted roadway, in the rain. A 2005 Chrysler Town & Country minivan (V1) was negotiating a left curve on a rural, bituminous, two-lane, two-way roadway heading northwest. The grade for V1 was 2% downhill with +3% superelevation in the curve. A 1995 Honda Accord LX sedan (V2) was traveling southeast on the same roadway in the opposite direction. The grade for V2's approach was 5% uphill. V2 crossed the centerline into V1's direction of travel as it negotiated a right curve. V1 and V2 collided head-on (Event 1). After impact, V1 came to rest near the point of impact on the northeast shoulder. V2 came to a police-reported final rest position in the roadway rearward of the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 40-year-old female case occupant. She was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt with an actuated buckle pretensioner. Her steering wheel and knee bolster airbags were deployed. The available right instrument panel airbag did not deploy. No side airbags were installed. She was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before later being transferred to a trauma center with moderate injuries. V2 was driven by a 45-year-old male non-case occupant and occupied by two other non-case occupants. He was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt and deployed frontal airbag. The vehicle was not equipped with side airbags. He sustained police-reported non-incapacitating injuries.
