The crash occurred on a five-lane primary arterial that ran north/south through a business district about twenty seven meters south of an intersection with a residential road. There were two southbound travel lanes, with lane three as a left turn only lane at the intersection but otherwise was also a left turn lane for both travel directions. There were two northbound through lanes. The primary arterial was straight and level. Conditions at the time of the crash were overcast with steady rain in the early afternoon on a weekend. The speed limit on the arterial was 64kph (40mph).

V1 was a 1994 Mazda 626 traveling south in lane two of the arterial. It was decelerating for the red light and stopped traffic at the intersection when the driver reached to his right with both hands to put his food down in the right front seat and his left foot slipped off the clutch pedal. This re-engaged the transmission causing V1 to run into the back of V2, a 1998 Mazda B3000 4x4 pickup truck. V2 had been stopped at the red light for some time when it was struck in the rear by the front of V1. Both vehicles came to rest facing south in their original travel lanes at the point of impact. V1 was towed from the scene while V2 drove away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 was driven by a 45 year old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. He had left the store only a few minutes previous to the crash. The driver stated in the interview that his feet were wet and he should have known better but was putting his food down to “drive more safely”.
