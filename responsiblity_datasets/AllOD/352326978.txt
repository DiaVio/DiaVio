Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 79-year old, female driver, of a 2006 Chrysler 300 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a frontal collision with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of a winter weekday, on a curved, two-lane roadway. This roadway runs north and south and has a left turning curve for the southbound travel direction, at the area of the crash. The speed limit is 45 mph (64 km/h) and the overall environment is rural. At the time of the crash the weather was cloudy and the roadway surface was wet and muddy (due to a previous rain). Vehicle 1, the 2006 Chrysler 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 79-year old female driver (case occupant), in the southbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by her respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the left turning curve and continue traveling southbound. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the left turning curve, the driver experienced a loss of control due to a wet and muddy surface area of the roadway (low lying area near a stream/creek). Vehicle 1 departed the roadway to the right and traveled a moderate distance before striking a fiberglass post and beam fence with its frontal plane (event 1). Vehicle 1 crossed over a private driveway and struck another fiberglass post and beam fence with its frontal plane (event 2), before striking a 40 cm tree (event 3). Vehicle 1 came to rest at the tree, facing a southerly direction. As a result of the impact with the tree, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospital with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
