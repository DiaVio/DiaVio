Vehicle one (V1), a 1985 Chevy Astro Van with an unknown number of occupants, was traveling northbound when V1 was driven over an embankment after negotiating a right turn from an intersecting roadway at a high rate of speed. V1 had left a roadway departure tire yaw-mark that was 11.2 meters long (37 feet) before it impacted a curb on the left side of the roadway. V1 then departed the roadway on the left and traveled a short distance on a grassy area. V1 rolled over to the left landing on the roof, dropping off of an approximately 3 meter tall (10 feet) rock embankment. The driver and any possible occupants fled the scene. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
