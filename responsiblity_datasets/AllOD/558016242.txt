The case vehicle, a 1991 Mazda 626 sedan was traveling northbound on a two-lane asphalt roadway. It was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions. A deer crossed the path of the case vehicle and the driver veered to the right to avoid a collision. The right wheels of the case vehicle left the pavement and the driver lost control of the case vehicle as she attempted to return to the roadway. The vehicle rotated counterclockwise entered a yaw, crossed the centerline, traversed the mouth of a private drive and departed the roadway off of the west shoulder. The case vehicle was briefly airborne as it crossed a ditch, before it struck the higher, west ditch embankment with the front of its undercarriage. The impact caused the vehicle to accelerate its counterclockwise rotation and roll four-quarter turns, right side leading. The case vehicle came to a rest on its wheels facing west, straddling the ditch.

The case occupant is the restrained 16-year-old female driver. She was using the automatic shoulder belt without the manual lap belt. She was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. She was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center.
