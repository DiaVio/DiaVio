Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado two door pickup was westbound on an undivided two lane, two way asphalt state highway that had a curve to the right with a downhill grade for V1's direction of travel. There are no curbs or shoulders on either side of the highway, and adjacent to the west roadway edge in the curve is a grassy berm. While negotiating this curve to the right, the driver of V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway and the front of V1 impacted the berm. V1 became airborne off the berm as the front impacted a large tree, shearing it and uprooting the tree from its base. V1 continued traveling forward and the left side then impacted two trees non-horizontally. A large tree branch from the first tree struck then fell on top of V1's passenger compartment. V1 came to final rest on its left tires, tilted to the left slightly against these two trees. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 58 year old male, was the sole occupant and not belted with a frontal impact air bag deployment on impact with the first tree. This driver sustained serious injuries and was located hours post crash and then was transported to the trauma center.
