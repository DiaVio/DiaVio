Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 1998 Honda Civic, four-door (case study vehicle). Vehicle 2 (V2) is a 2002 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, two-door.

The frontal air bags did not deploy as a result of the impact.

The crash occurred during the hours of daylight. The weather at the time of the crash was clear and dry. The roadway surface was dry. The posted speed limit is 45 mph (72 kmph).

The crash occurred at an intersection. The roadway travels primarily east and west. The roadway is divided by a raised concrete median. The eastbound direction consists of three through lanes and a dedicated left turn lane. The westbound direction consists of two through lanes and a dedicated left turn lane. The intersecting roadway is controlled by a stop sign. The roadway is level in the area of the crash.

V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the eastbound direction. V2 was traveling westbound in the right through lane. V1's driver looked but did not observe V2. V1 pulled into the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. The impact caused V1 to come to rest in the left turn lane of the eastbound direction.
