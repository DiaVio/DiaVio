This case involved a 27 year old female unrestrained right rear passenger of a 2007 Dodge Caliber four door hatchback (V1). There were three other occupants of V1, the 32 year old restrained male driver, a 41 year old restrained female right front passenger and a 30 year old unrestrained male left rear passenger. V1 was equipped with frontal steering wheel hub air bag, lower instrument panel (knee bolster) air bag for the driver and front instrument panel air bag for the front right seat position. It was also equipped with head curtain air bags for the left and right, front and rear outboard positions. All air bags deployed in the crash, except for the left side head curtain air bag. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 2007 Ford Mustang 2-door coupe (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours on a straight and level dry asphalt multi-lane roadway. The posted speed limit for both directions was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was traveling west in the left turn lane of four lanes approaching an intersection at 40 kph (25 mph). V2 was going east in the third of four lanes at approximately 80 kph (50 mph) intending to go straight through the intersection. V1 attempted to turn left onto the intersecting roadway and was struck in the right side by the front of V2. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and traveled off the southeast quadrant of the intersection facing southwest for final rest. V2 rotated 140 degrees clockwise, coming to rest in the right eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The right rear passenger of V1 (case subject) was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to severe injuries sustained in the crash. The right front and left rear passengers of V1 were also transported to a level one trauma center with incapacitating injuries. The driver of V1 was uninjured and required no medical treatment.
