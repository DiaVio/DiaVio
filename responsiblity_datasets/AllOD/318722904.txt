This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 78-year-old male belted driver with a deployed front airbag. This occupant was driving a compact pickup truck when it was involved in an offset frontal collision with a compact utility vehicle, resulting in severe damage to the case vehicle. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred early afternoon on a dry road in clear conditions. A 2012 Chevrolet Colorado compact pickup (Vehicle 1) was traveling north on a bituminous two-lane rural road negotiating a left curve. The road had negligible grade in V1's direction of travel. A 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 2) was traveling south negotiating the curve in the opposite direction. The road grade was 3% downhill in V2's direction of travel. There were no traffic controls in the vicinity of the crash. The driver of V2 suffered a medical emergency and lost control of his vehicle. V2 departed its lane to the left, encroaching into V1's lane of travel. V1 braked without lockup in avoidance. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2 (Event 1). V1 was pushed back a short distance from impact. V2 traveled a short distance before coming to rest on the east shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 78-year-old male driver. He was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by 7 cm of payout to the shoulder belt and 4 cm of payout to the lap belt. The retractor pretensioner did not show evidence of actuation, although the unoccupied right front seat had an actuated retractor pretensioner. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed in the crash. The available right instrument panel airbag and curtain airbags did not deploy. There were no other airbags installed in this vehicle. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
