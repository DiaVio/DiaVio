This case involves an arrested rollover into tree by a passenger car. The case occupant is the 26-year-old male driver. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2010 four-door Mitsubishi Lancer, was southbound on a dry, two-lane, asphalt road with an eight percent down-grade. It was dark, not lighted and cloudy. The case vehicle drifted off the roadway off the west edge. The driver over-corrected and the case vehicle entered a counterclockwise yaw, crossed through the northbound lane, departed the roadway off the east edge and went down an embankment with a 10-15% downgrade. The front end of the case vehicle narrowly engaged an 81-cm tree, struck a small post, snagged the undercarriage on the embankment/edge of a private drive, entered a right-side leading rollover, rolled a total of four-quarter turns, and struck a 34-cm bole of a double bole tree with its right side. It then reversed the direction of its roll, rolled two-quater turns and came to rest on its roof at the bottom of a ditch facing northeast. The restrained 26-year-old male driver and the 21-year-old male right-front passenger were the sole occupants of the case vehicle. The driver sustained multiple minor injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center, where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
