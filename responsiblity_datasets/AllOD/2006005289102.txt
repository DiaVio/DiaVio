This two-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a T-intersection. The T-intersection consists of a divided east/west roadway and a divided north/south roadway controlled by properly functioning traffic signals. The eastbound direction featured three bituminous, straight, and level lanes with lane three designated as a left-turn only lane. The westbound direction also featured three bituminous, straight, and level lanes with lane one designated as a right-turn only lane.

V2, a 2003 Nissan Altima, was westbound in lane two intending to continue straight through the intersection. As V1 turned across the westbound lanes the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. The impact caused V1 to be pushed onto a raised median where it tripped over onto its left side.
