This crash occurred on a weekday morning.

Vehicle #1, a 2003 Honda Element, was traveling south on the two lane undivided roadway when it stopped to allow northbound traffic to pass before making a left turn into a driveway. Vehicle #2, a 1997 Ford Thunderbird XL, was traveling on the same two lane undivided roadway, in the same direction behind Vehicle #1. Vehicle #2 impacted the rear of Vehicle #1 with its front. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway facing south. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The Honda Element (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 43 year old female who was transported to an area hospital, treated and released for a complaint of pain to her neck. No interview was obtained, unable to contact driver of V1 and no further information is available. Vehicle #1 was driven from the scene.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was when another vehicle was in her lane traveling in the same direction at a higher speed. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. The driver of the Honda Element was not thought to have contributed to the crash. There is no evidence of any drug use legal or illegal by this driver.

The Ford Thunderbird (Vehicle #2) was driven by a belted 71-year-old male who reported no injuries. There was a belted 70-year-old female passenger in the right front seat who had a complaint of pain to her head, but refused medical transport. Both the driver and passenger airbags were deployed. It should be noted that there was a handicap card hanging from the rearview mirror. The driver indicated that he was familiar with the road and denied any inattention or distractions. He indicated that he never speeds and was going the suggested speed limit of 72 KPH (45 MPH). The driver was wearing his glasses at the time, but does not know his corrected vision. Driver refused to give any information regarding current medications. Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was other motor vehicle in lane stopped.

The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was too fast for conditions to be able to respond to unexpected actions of other road users, a decision error. This was chosen because this driver saw the stopped vehicle, braked and skidded approximately 22 meters before it struck Vehicle #1. Had Vehicle #2 been traveling the suggested speed, anticipated other's actions (is familiar with road) there would have been ample time to slow or stop to avoid the collision. No other reason was attributed to Vehicle #2 as the driver refused to give further medical information (pre-existing conditions or medications). The police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests for either driver.
