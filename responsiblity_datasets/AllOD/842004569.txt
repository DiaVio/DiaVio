This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 51-year old female driver of a 2000 Honda Accord LX 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse RS 2-door hatchback (Vehicle 2). The case vehicle was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side impact air bags for the front outboard seating positions. The driver side impact air bag deployed. Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle 2 was westbound on the same roadway and negotiating a right curve. It was daylight, with rainy weather conditions as the road was wet. Vehicle 2 reached the apex of the curve and crossed the centerline, into the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the eastbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1 resulting in severe damage (event 1). At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and departed the south pavement edge. The right rear side surface of Vehicle 1 struck the backslope of a ditch, which resulted in moderate damage (event 2). At this point, Vehicle 1 was reported by police to have traveled down an embankment, coming to rest in a wooded area facing northwest. Vehicle 2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest along the north pavement edge of the roadway facing southwest. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 1 sustained an ISS of 11 and an MAIS of 3. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
