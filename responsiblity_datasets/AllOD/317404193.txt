This crash involved a 77 year old restrained male driver in a 2010 Hyundai Accent 4-door sedan (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual first row seat mounted airbags, dual first and second row side curtains. The steering wheel mounted airbag and right side curtain were the only airbags that deployed. V2, a 2000 Dodge Ram pick-up that was towing a trailer was also involved in the crash. V1 was traveling west on a two-lane, wet asphalt roadway while negotiating a left curve in misty weather. V2 was traveling east on a three-lane, wet roadway while negotiating a right curve in the same misty weather. The posted speed limit for both travel directions was 89 kph (55 mph). As the two vehicles approached each other, V2 ran off the roadside to the right. He steered left in an attempt to maneuver his vehicle back onto the roadway. V2 re-entered the roadway and crossed the center lane line into the westbound traffic. The driver of V1 noticed V2 in his lane, so he steered right onto the shoulder and braked (without lock-up). V2 continued across the westbound lane onto the westbound shoulder where it contacted the front of V1 with its front. V2 continued forward and pushed V1 rearward into the guardrail where V1's right side contacted the guardrail. V1 came to rest facing west near the guardrail. After separation, V2 began to head right and crossed back over the westbound and eastbound lanes. V2 came to rest on the roadside adjacent to the eastbound lanes facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was taken from the crash scene by ambulance to a local hospital. He was later transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. He was hospitalized for 3 days.
