This case involved a belted front right seat female passenger of a small passenger car responding to a six quarter-turn, left side leading, trip-over sequence. The vehicle was damaged 'moderately', while the subject sustained a 'serious' injury. This single-vehicle rollover crash occurred on the westbound side of a divided interstate traveling through a rural area. There were two lanes for travel in each direction divided by a wide, depressed median. The natural terrain was sandy and level, situated approximately one meter lower than the roadway. The weather was clear, and the bituminous roadway dry, during the mid-morning weekday crash. The case vehicle was traveling westbound in the number-two lane. The 2008 Nissan Altima four-door sedan was equipped with first row frontal-impact air bags and pretensioner equipped lap and shoulder belts (neither deployed nor actuated). There were two occupants in V1. The seventy-eight year old male driver and the seventy-five year old female front right seat passenger were using the belt restraints. "The cruise control was set to 112kmph to 120kmph. The driver of the case vehicle reached across the seatback to retrieve an item and allowed the vehicle to travel off of the roadway to the left, into the median. He steered right in an effort to regain the roadway as the vehicle traveled onto the downward banked median." The steering maneuver brought the vehicle up and onto the roadway in a clockwise yaw. The vehicle continued across the roadway and off the north side. The vehicle did not trip on the slightly-raised curbed edge, but slid off and touched down into the sandy terrain with its left front wheel and undercarriage. The impact caused the vehicle to overturn six quarter-turns to the left, coming to rest on its top, facing east. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage and the occupants were transported to a trauma facility due to serious injuries.
