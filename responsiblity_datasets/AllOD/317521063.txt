This case focuses on an unrestrained 51 year old male driver in a 2010 Ford Fusion. V1 was equipped with dual side curtains, and dual frontal and side airbags. The driver's frontal airbag was the only airbag that deployed in the crash. V2, a 1999 Ford Ranger was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours at the "T" shaped intersection of a lighted roadway. The lanes running east to west consisted of three eastbound lanes. The two left eastbound lanes were left turn lanes and the right lane was a right turn lane. The lanes were controlled by a stop sign and a warning light that flashed red. The north and southbound lanes consisted of two southbound lanes and two northbound lanes that were separated by a two-way left turn lane. These lanes were controlled by flashing amber lights. It was raining during the time of the crash and the asphalt roadway was wet. The speed limit for both vehicles was 64 kph (40 mph). V1 was traveling eastbound in lane three (far left turn lane) approaching the stop sign and warning light. V2 was traveling southbound in lane two approaching the intersection (controlled by a flashing amber light). V1 did not stop at the stop sign before attempting the left hand turn. The driver of V2 applied his brakes and steered left in an attempt to avoid a collision. The front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise before coming to rest in the intersection facing southeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest on the northbound shoulder facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was taken to a local hospital by ground; however, he was later transferred to a level one trauma center and treated for serious injuries he sustained in the crash.
