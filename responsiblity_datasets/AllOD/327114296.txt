This case involves a moderate, 12 o'clock, frontal impact, in an off-set mode to the front-right of a passenger car. The case occupants are the 95-year-old male driver and the 85-year-old female right-front passenger. Neither of the occupants were restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel and top instrument-panel air bags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2001, four-door Honda Civic, was northbound in the level, dry asphalt parking lot encircling a gas station on a cloudy day. As the vehicle was turning left, the driver lost control. The case vehicle accelerated and struck a parked straight truck with a dump box, under-riding it to a limited extent. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. The unrestrained 95-year-old male driver and the 85-year-old female right-front passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. Both occupants sustained serious injuries and were transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as case occupants.
