This case involves a non-horizontal impact between a passenger car and an embankment followed by a two-quarter turn rollover. The restrained 76-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. The case vehicle, a 2007, four-door, Buick Lucerne, was traveling west on a dry, asphalt, two-lane road with an up-grade. It was daylight and clear. Case vehicle departed the roadway off of the right side, struck a mailbox with its front-end, struck an embankment with the front-portion of the undercarriage, rolled right-side leading two quarter turns and came to rest on its roof facing west. The 76-year-old male driver was restrained by the three-point belt and the steering wheel-mounted frontal airbag deployed. He was transported to an outside hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant. The case occupant had fallen from a ladder prior to the crash. The severe chest and abdominal injuries were ruled to be pre-existing. The serious lumbar spine injury was attributed to the crash.
