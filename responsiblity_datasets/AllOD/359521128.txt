This frontal impact followed by a minor rollover involved a 69 year old restrained female driver that sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred at night with no street lights, and it was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle (V1), a 2004 Lexus RX330 compact utility vehicle was southbound on a two lane, two way roadway that curved to the left and was bordered on the west side with a steel guard rail. On the east side of the roadway was a steep embankment. As V1 was negotiating the curve, it departed the roadway to the right and the right side swiped the guard rail causing minor damage. V1 then swerved to the left and crossed over the opposite lane and departed the roadway to the left. The front of V1 impacted a steep muddy embankment that lifted up the front and front left end of the vehicle. V1 then began to rollover to the right three quarter turns and came to final rest on the driver's side in the ditch facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant, who is a 69 year old female and was restrained with the lap/shoulder belt. No airbags deployed. She was taken to a local hospital with serious injuries and later transferred to the trauma center. One other passenger in the vehicle that was seated in the front right position is a 70 year old male and was using the lap/shoulder belt. He was also transported to a local hospital with unknown injuries.
