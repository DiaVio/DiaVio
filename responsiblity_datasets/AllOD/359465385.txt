This moderate frontal crash with a subsequent two quarter turn rollover involved a 42 year old male driver who was restrained with manual lap/shoulder belt. He sustained moderate severity injuries and was transported to a trauma center. This single vehicle crash occurred on two, one-way eastbound lanes of a divided freeway at night with street lights. A concrete barrier bordered the north side and a guard rail bordered the south side. It was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Chevrolet Aveo four door hatchback was eastbound in lane two and lost control. V1 departed the lane and roadway to the left. The front left corner of V1 then impacted the concrete barrier. The front left of the V1 lifted upward and V1 began to rollover to the right, contacted the right side with the ground, and then continued on to its top. V1 then slid on its roof top some distance eastward in lane two and came to final rest in lane two. V1 was towed and disabled. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who is a 42 year old male. He was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. He sustained moderate severity injuries and was transported to the trauma center. Another occupant was in the front right passenger seat who was a 43 year old female. She was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and also sustained moderate injuries and her transport status was unknown.
