V1, a 1997 Ford Thunderbird and the case study vehicle, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, dark conditions. V2, 2000 Chevrolet Impala sedan, was traveling west on the same roadway. V2 crossed the centerline and the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 came to final rest on the south side of the roadway while V2 came to rest on the north side. The driver of V1, a 46-year-old female and the case study occupant, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and both frontal air bags deployed in V1. V1 was towed due to damage and the driver was transported to a level one trauma center for treatment.
