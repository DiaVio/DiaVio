The case occupant is a 51 year old female driver who was involved in a moderate frontal collision with another vehicle. This driver was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment and she sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred at dusk, during overcast weather and wet roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of one east and one westbound asphalt travel lane, with a center left-turn only lane and paved shoulders on both sides. For eastbound vehicles, the travel lanes have a slight uphill grade and curve to the left and on the south side there is a guardrail adjacent to the shoulder. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chrysler Sebring two door convertible, was traveling east in the eastbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Honda Accord four door sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lane. As V2 entered the curved section of roadway, there were several non-contact vehicles traveling ahead of V2. The driver of V2 passed the vehicles on the left, traveled across the center lane and into the eastbound travel lane. V1's front left impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of the case occupant's seat belt buckle pretensioner and the deployment of the frontal air bags. V2 overpowered V1, forcing V1 backwards. Then the back of V1 impacted a guardrail, resulting in minor vehicle damage. V1 came to final rest on the south shoulder, facing north. After the initial impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the eastbound travel lane, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 51 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's seat belt buckle pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in V1.
