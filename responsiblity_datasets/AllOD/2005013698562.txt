Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 a 1996 Ford Ranger was traveling west approaching the intersection, looking down at directions she had written down on a piece of paper, and was also talking with her son. The driver of V1 stated that when she looked up the light had turned red and she was about to impact the other vehicle. She then stated that there was not enough time to apply the brakes, to avoid the collision.

V2 a 2003 Chevy Impala was stopped at the traffic light waiting for it to turn green so she could proceed. She said that when it turned green she pulled out into the intersection, when the other vehicle collided with her.

The critical pre-crash event coded for V1 is crossing over passing through an intersection. The critical reason coded for V1 is an internal distraction (she was looking at directions not at the road). The critical pre-crash event coded for V2 is other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path. V2 was not given a critical reason.
