This case involves two case occupants, an 81 year old female right front passenger and an 83 year old male right 2nd row passenger. The right front passenger was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt and had a deployed side impact seat mounted airbag. The right rear seat passenger was restrained by the lap and shoulder belt, but had no airbag available. The case vehicle (V1), a 2005 Lincoln Town Car Signature four-door sedan was being driven by a 60 year old restrained female. The other vehicle (V2) involved in the crash was a 2008 Honda Accord four door sedan. The crash occurred during daylight hours and the asphalt roadways were dry without any adverse weather conditions. V1 was traveling south on a two-lane two way roadway with a 2% downgrade and V2 was traveling east on a three-lane one way straight and level roadway. V1's travel lane was controlled by a stop sign and the travel lane of V2 was uncontrolled. V1 was attempting to pass through the intersection when it was contacted on the right side by the front of V2. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and then roll to the left four quarter turns. V1 came to rest in the southwest quadrant of the intersection. V2 was traveling in the left lane when the impact occurred then continued forward approximately 28 meters to final rest in the right lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The right front passenger sustained severe injuries and was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center where she was hospitalized for 34 days. The right rear passenger also received severe injuries in the crash and was transported to the level one trauma center and hospitalized.
