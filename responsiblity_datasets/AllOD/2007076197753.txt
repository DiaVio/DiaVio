This single vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane asphalt roadway. The eastbound lane begins straight, curves right at a 45-degree angle then straightens out again and is level. There is no posted speed limit and the police report states the lawful speed as a reasonable and prudent speed. The crash occurred during mid-afternoon during daylight hours with no adverse weather or road conditions present.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado pickup, driven by a eighteen (18) year old female was eastbound when it departed the left road edge at the beginning of the right curve. V1's driver steered right and returned to the roadway. V1 then departed the right road edge where it's driver steered left and overcompensated again. The vehicle then tripped, flipped and rolled right one complete time landing on its tires, which were still spinning. The driver was ejected during the rollover. The vehicle continued traveling westbound and came to rest on the westbound shoulder facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver was traveling to an unknown location with her 1-year-old daughter. She claimed to have steered left to avoid a rock in the road but the police officer stated he found nothing on the roadway at the time of the investigation. An observer witnessed V1 traveling at 80 - 89 kph (50 - 55 mph) prior to the crash, but did not witness the crash itself.

The critical pre-crash event was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the road edge on the left side The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn. Aggressive driving, for chasing another vehicle, was considered an associative factor.
