Vehicle One (V1), a 1998 Buick LeSabre sedan, was traveling west in lane three of a five lane, westbound portion of a divided interstate under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle Two (V2), a 1999 Mitusbishi FE Medium/Heavy Truck, was starting from a stop in lane three of the same roadway in front of V1, after picking up a sign that fell of the truck. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V2, and both vehicles came to final rest immediately afterward. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 43-year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
