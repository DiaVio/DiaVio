This case involved the belted female driver of a passenger car responding to a head-on collision with an SUV. The subject's frontal-impact air bag deployed during the 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact, which caused 'severe' vehicle damage and resulted in serious injuries to the subject. This two vehicle crash occurred in the westbound lanes of an east/west trafficway traveling through a residential/commercial area. The trafficway had three lanes for westbound travel and four lanes for eastbound travel divided by a raised curb median. The trafficway was straight with a grade increase from east to west. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2004 Hyundai Accent, 4-door sedan) was traveling eastbound in the number-three westbound lane. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, first row frontal-impact air bags and first row seat back mounted side-impact air bags. The 19-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined as using the belt restraint, based on physical evidence. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2008 Honda Pilot, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling westbound in the number-three lane (left). V1 had been traveling on the wrong side of the trafficway median, and was now traveling downhill. V2 had been stopped at a traffic signal and had begun accelerating uphill as the vehicles met. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a head-on collision. V1's frontal-impact air bags deployed. Both vehicles came to rest at the point of impact without separating with V1 facing east and V2 facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case subject was transported to a trauma facility with severe injuries. The occupants of V2 were also transported with varying degrees of injury.
