Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford Escape utility vehicle, was traveling east in lane three of a three lane roadway, part of a six lane divided trafficeway approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection and the right of V1 contacted the front of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the southeast portion of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 50 year old female and case study occupant, was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and had her buckle-mounted and b-pillar mounted pretensioners deploy. In addition, the steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deployed, as well as both curtain air bags and both seat-mounted thorax air bags. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment and later transfered to a level-one trauma center.
