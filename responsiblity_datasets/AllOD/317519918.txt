This case focuses on an unrestrained 66 year old right front female passenger in a 2010 Ford F150 pickup truck. There was also a 69 year old restrained driver in V1. V1 was equipped with dual frontal and side airbags. No airbags deployed during the crash. V2, a 2013 Volvo Medium Heavy truck towing a trailer was also involved in the collision. V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane on a two-way, two-lane, dark and unlit roadway. The asphalt road was dry and the weather was clear. The posted speed limit was (89kph) 55mph. V2 was traveling northbound on the same roadway. As V1 headed south it drifted left across the center lane line. The driver of V2 steered right and braked in an attempt to avoid the collision. The front of V1 contacted the left side of V2 just below the driver's door and continued down the side of V2. After contacting the rear tandem wheels of V2, V1 rotated counterclockwise and departed the roadway to the left. V1 traveled down a short embankment before coming to rest on the roadside facing east. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The passenger in V1 was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance. She was later transferred to a level one trauma center and received treatment for moderate injuries that she sustained.
