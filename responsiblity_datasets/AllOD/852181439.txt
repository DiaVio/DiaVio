This case occupant is a 42 year old male driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a severe rollover crash. He sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle rollover crash occurred during the early evening hours in darkness with no overhead street lights and overcast weather conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 AM General Hummer H2 large utility vehicle, was westbound in lane one of a two lane, two way highway. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt travel lanes are straight, level and are bordered by narrow paved shoulders and a grassy ditch that leads to an embankment. As V1 traveled west, it departed the roadway to the right and the undercarriage impacted an embankment, resulting in moderate damage. V1 continued to climb over the embankment and began to rotate counterclockwise and rolled over to the left. V1 completed eight quarter turns before coming to final rest on its tires, facing south with its front end on the shoulder and its back end off the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 42 year old male, who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center and hospitalized. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
