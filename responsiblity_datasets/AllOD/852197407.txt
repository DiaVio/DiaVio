This moderate severity frontal crash involved two case occupants, a 25 year old female driver who sustained serious injuries and was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal airbag deployment, and a 2 month old female in a rear-facing infant seat who sustained a serious injury. This crash occurred in the two one-way lanes of a divided freeway where a left turn only lane begins just before a two lane, two way street that crosses over the median. At the time of the crash it was daylight and raining with wet roadway surfaces. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Jeep Liberty four door compact utility was travelling westbound in lane one of the two one way lanes bordered by a paved shoulder lane on the north side. Vehicle two (V2), a Freightliner tractor trailor, was westbound in the paved shoulder lane and began a left turn to the median crossing lane with the trailor angled across lanes one and two. V1 then began to brake and sweve left slightly and remained in lane one before the front of V1 impacted the back left corner of the truck's trailor. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest in lane one facing northwest. V2 continued to move after impact and came to final rest facing southwest with the truck in the median crossing and the trailor angled across the left turn only lane. V1 was towed and disabled. V2 was driven from the scene. There are two case occupants in V1. The driver, a 25 year old female, who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt with the retractor pretensioner acuating at impact and the frontal steering column mounted airbag deploying. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The second case occupant was a 2 month old female in a rear-facing infant seat located in the second row middle position. She sustained a serious injury and had treatment later and was not transported from the scene.
