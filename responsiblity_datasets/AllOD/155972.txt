Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Escape, 4-door utility vehicle was travelling north in the northbound left-turn lane on a five-lane, two-way road (two lanes northbound, left turn lane, two lanes southbound) and was approaching a controlled 3-leg intersection with the intention of turning left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Dodge Stratus, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the left southbund lane of the same road and was approaching the same 3-leg intersection. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. V1 was traversing an uphill grade while V2 was traversing a downhill grade. As both vehicles approached the intersection, the driver of V1 attempted to turn left and crossed the path of V2. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V2 obliquely struck the front of V1. The impact caused V1 to rotate counter clockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise, resulting in the right side of V1 contacting the left side of V2 in a sideslap type impact. V1 subsequently tripped over its left side wheels and rolled two-quarter turns (left-side leading) coming to rest on its roof, at the southwest corner of the intersection facing north-northwest. Both vehicles were towed from scene due to diasbling vehicle damage. The 80-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She ws transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
