This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 46-year-old male belted driver with a deployed frontal airbag. This occupant sustained serious injuries when the full-size sedan he was driving collided head-on with a compact pickup truck. The crash occurred late afternoon under clear skies on a dry road. A 2008 Chevrolet Impala LS full size sedan (V1) was traveling east on a two-lane two-way rural bituminous road. The grade for V1 was 5% downhill. A 1993 Nissan compact pickup truck (V2) was traveling west on the same road in the opposite direction. The approach for V2 was 5% uphill. V2 traveled left over the center line into V2's direction of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on (Event 1), in a full frontal configuration. V2 rotated counterclockwise 150 degrees before its right plane impacted the left plane of V1 (Event 2) in a sideslap, sideswipe pattern. V2 continued rotating counterclockwise another 90 degrees before coming to rest in the road. V1 continued off the right side of the road down an embankment, impacting the ground with its front plane (Event 3). V1 came to rest in the south roadside. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 46-year-old male case occupant. He was belted and the available retractor pretensioner was actuated. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed. No other airbags were available for this position. He was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries.
