Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Ford F250, regular 2-door cab, 3/4 ton, 4x4 pickup truck was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and V1 was traversing a downgrade when the driver allowed the right tires of V1 to drift off the right road edge. The driver of V1 then steered left to re-enter the road but oversteered and crossed the centerline and eastbound lane before departing the left side of the road. As V1 departed the road, it struck and passed through a wooden privacy fence causing some wooden pieces to penetrate the vehicle interior. The front of V1 then struck a parked travel trailer causing it to move/rotate counterclockwise several meters. V1 rotated counterclockwise off the travel trailer and the right side of V1 struck and snapped a small tree. V1 came to rest off the road facing east-northeast. V1 sustained a minor engine fire which was extinguished by witnesses. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 48-year-old male driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center where he was hospitalized for treatment.
