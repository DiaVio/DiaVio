The case vehicle, a 1999 two-door Chevrolet Cavalier convertible, was in the inside northbound through lane of a wet, four-lane, asphalt roadway, approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Honda Odyssey minivan, was in the southbound left-turn lane. The driver of V2 made a left turn and V2 entered the path of the case vehicle. The front of V2 struck the front of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise before it came to rest in the intersection facing east-northeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to a rest facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 42-year-old female driver and the 43-year-old female right-front passenger were restrained by three-point belts. Both the steering-wheel and top instrument panel air bags deployed. Both occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and both enrolled as case occupants.
