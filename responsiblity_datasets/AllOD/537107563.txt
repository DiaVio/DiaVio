Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 GMC Envoy, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a four-lane, divided, limited access freeway. Vehicle two (V2) a 2003 Peterbilt 387, tractor pulling one trailer was also traveling east in the eastbound lane and was behind V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier, 4-door sedan was also traveling east in the left eastbound lane and was between V1 and V2. Vehicle four (V4), a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the right eastbound lane and was ahead of V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear and the bituminous road was dry. As the vehicles proceeded eastbound, they were approaching, but not yet in, a construction zone. The drivers of V1, V3, and V4 began to slow for traffic congestion but the driver of V2 did not recognize the speed change of V3 and the front of V2 struck the rear of V3 causing V3 to drive into the median and come to rest. V2 continued on and struck the rear of V1. This impact caused V1 to enter the median while rotating in a counterclockwise manner where it tripped over its right side wheels, rolled four quarter turns, and came to rest on its wheels in the median. V2 continued further eastbound, entered the right eastbound lane and struck the rear of V4. All four vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 48-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
