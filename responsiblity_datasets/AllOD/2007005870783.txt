The crash occurred on an undivided north/south two-lane roadway. This was a straight, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35mph). The grade of the roadway for southbound travel was downhill greater than two percent. The crash occurred early evening on a weekday, the weather was clear and the roadway was wet due to an earlier rainfall.

V1, a Mazda MX5 convertible with one occupant, was traveling northbound when the right side tires went off the roadway to the right. The driver then steered to the left to get back onto the roadway and due to an unknown reason, the driver overcompensated her steering to the right and departed the roadway on the right side. V1 struck a telephone pole with the front left of the vehicle. V1 then spun clockwise and struck a bridge abutment with the right side of the vehicle. V1 continued a clockwise rotation and came to final rest after striking the bridge abutment with the front right side of the vehicle. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of the Mazda, a 34 year-old female, was transported by helicopter to a medical facility for lacerations to her left arm and leg as well as her head. This information was provided by the medical report. An interview with the driver was not obtained despite numerous attempts to make contact. A witness on-scene told police that the vehicle was being operated in a careless manner and was traveling at a high rate of speed. The witness stated that he thought V1 was going to go airborne after going up the hill. It should be noted that the owner/driver lives on the same street where the crash occurred.

The Critical Pre-crash Event was "This vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a driver related factor: overcompensation. Speed and wet road conditions were associated factors.
