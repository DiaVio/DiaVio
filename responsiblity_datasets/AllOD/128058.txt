The case occupant was the 164 cm, 81 kg (5 ft 5 in, 180 lb), 40-year-old female driver of a 1998 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan. Her vehicle experienced an offset-frontal impact with the side of another passenger vehicle that had been involved in a previous impact and spun into the path of the case vehicle. The impact was classified as severe. Although the WinSMASH reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 29 kmph (18 mph), the reviewing group felt that the observed vehicle damage displayed a severity closer to 50+ kmph (31+ mph) and this severity range was coded in the case. The case occupant was using the available three-point seat belt. The steering-wheel-mounted airbag deployed. In response to the 12 o'clock (350 degrees) principal direction of force, the case occupant moved forward and slightly to the left, relative to the vehicle interior. She sustained a splenic laceration from contact with the left interior door armrest. She sustained left radial and ulnar styloid fractures probably from contact with the instrument panel. She sustained a left posterior acetabular fracture, left distal femur fracture, and a left midshaft femur fracture from knee contact with the knee bolster. She also sustained a right talus fracture and a right medial malleolus fracture from contact with the toepan/foot controls. She died from complications of her injuries (pulmonary embolism) 17 days post-crash while in a rehabilitation facility.
