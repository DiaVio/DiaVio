This near-side impact crash case involves an 85 year old male driver, restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, with deployed frontal and left side air bags who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a four legged intersection controlled by traffic signals. The north-south roadway consists of three undivided asphalt travel lanes, one northbound, one southbound and one left-turn only lane, with a slight uphill grade for southbound vehicles. The east-west asphalt roadway also consists of three lanes, one eastbound, one westbound and one left-turn only lane, with a slight uphill grade for westbound vehicles. At the time of the crash, there were rainy weather conditions and wet roadways. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Kia Optima four door sedan, was traveling west in lane one and vehicle 2 (V2), a 2002 Subaru Forester compact utility vehicle, was traveling south on the intersecting street. V1 and V2 entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted V1's right rear, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued in a westerly direction while rotating clockwise, traveled off the north side of the roadway and V1's left front door impacted a pole, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal and left side air bags. V1 came to final rest against the pole, facing northeast. After the initial impact, V2 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest in the intersection, facing southwest. V1 sustained disabling damage and was towed. V2 was able to be driven from the scene. The case occupant is the 85 year old male driver of V1 in the front left position who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, and the steering column mounted frontal air bag and left outboard seat back mounted side air bag both deployed. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
