The focus of this case is on an 51-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2009 Toyota Corolla (V1), involved in an offset frontal impact crash with a 2004 Honda Civic (V2). This two vehicle collision occurred during the early evening hours (dusk), of an autumn weekday, at a 3 lane roadway at the intersection to entrance ramps for a limited access highway. The 3 lane roadway is part of a 6 lane concrete divided trafficway that runs east and west. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for the east/west roadway is 72 km/h (45 mph). The 51-year old male driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the westbound roadway in the left travel lane. He was wearing his 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag. V2 was traveling in the left lane of the eastbound roadway approaching the intersection. For unknown reasons, V1 accelerated from a stop at the traffic light and lost control, crossing the center line and colliding with V2 as it was approaching the intersection from the west. After the initial impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in its original travel lane facing in a northeasterly direction. After the initial impact with V2, V1 was deflected onto the raised median, rotating clockwise, the front of V1 struck a sign post in the median which broke away and hit the top of the vehicle in the right rear corner of the roof. V1came to rest on top of the raised median pointed in a northwesterly direction. The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by ground, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. The driver V2 also transported, by ground, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. The extent of her injuries and/or treatments is unknown. Both vehicles were towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
