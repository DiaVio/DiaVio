This near-side impact crash case involves a 72 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with deployed side impact and side curtain air bags. He sustained serious injuries and was hospitalized at the trauma center for six days. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a four-legged intersection under cloudy weather and wet roadway conditions. The intersection is comprised of two north and two southbound asphalt travel lanes, with left turn lanes and traffic signals present at the intersection. The intersecting east/west asphalt roadway is comprised of two westbound and one eastbound lane, with left turn lanes and traffic signals present at the intersection. The westbound lanes have a slight uphill grade while the northbound lanes are level. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan, was traveling west in the inside westbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1999 GMC Suburban utility station wagon, was traveling north in lane two of the intersecting street. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the deployment of V1's left side impact air bag and left side curtain. V1 rotated clockwise as V2 rotated counterclockwise and the left side of V1 impacted the right side of V2, resulting in minor damage. After the second impact, both vehicles continued to rotate and travel in a northwesterly direction. V1 came to final rest on the north side of the intersection, in the center of the lanes, facing southwest. V2 came to final rest near V1, facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 72 year old male driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's left seat back outboard mounted side air bag and roof side rail mounted side curtain both deployed during the crash. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
