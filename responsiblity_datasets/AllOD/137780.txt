Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chrysler Sebring, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway and approaching a left curve. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Sterling tractor, pulling one trailer was traveling south in the southbound lane of the same roadway and was entering into a right curve. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was slush covered from an earlier snowfall. V2 was traveling on an uphill grade and V1 began a negative grade descent as it entered into the left curve. As the driver of V1 began negotiating the left curve, she lost control due to the slushy road conditions and V1 crossed the centerline and entered the southbound lane. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the front of V1. V1 came to rest off the right side of the road facing north and V2 came to a controlled stop in the southbound lane. Both vehicles were reportedly towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 82-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries.
