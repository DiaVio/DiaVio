The case occupant is a 40 year old female driver involved in a head-on collision who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment and seat belt retractor pretensioner activation who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early morning dark hours in the northbound lanes of a divided interstate freeway. There were no street lights available in this section of roadway and it was raining outside with wet travel lanes. For northbound vehicles, there are three lanes with paved shoulders on both sides. The north and southbound lanes are separated by a grassy median. In the area where the crash occurred, the northbound lanes are comprised of concrete, are straight and had an uphill grade. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, was northbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Suzuki Esteem station wagon was southbound in the northbound lanes, traveling in lane three, opposite V1. The driver of V1 braked but could not avoid the wrong-way vehicle, and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2. V1 rotated approximately 140 degrees counterclockwise and came to final rest facing southwest, with the front half on the west shoulder and the back half in lane three. The force of the impact pushed V2 backwards while rotating the vehicle approximately 275 degrees counterclockwise. V2 came to final rest on the grassy median, facing west. Both vehicles were severely damaged and were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant, a 40 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed and the seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated. This case driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. Other non-case occupants in V1 included a 32 year old front right female passenger who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. At impact, this occupant's instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed and her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated. She sustained minor injuries and was transported to a local hospital.
