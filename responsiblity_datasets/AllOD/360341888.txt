This near-side impact crash case involves a 34 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with deployed frontal and side impact air bags who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a four way angled intersection controlled by traffic signals. The north-south roadway is comprised of three north and three southbound travel lanes, with an additional left-turn only lane available for northbound traffic and a center median present on the north side of the intersection. The three lane, two way intersecting street is comprised of one westbound and one eastbound lane, with left-turn only lanes available. The northbound lanes are comprised of asphalt and have a slight uphill grade, while the westbound asphalt travel lane is level. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe compact utility vehicle, was traveling west in lane one and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2000 Lincoln Town Car four door sedan, was traveling north in lane one on the intersecting street. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal and left side impact air bags. V1 rotated clockwise as it moved north and came to final rest in the northbound lanes, facing northeast. After the initial impact, V2 continued traveling forward and came to final rest near V1, facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 34 year old female driver of V1 who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's steering column mounted frontal and seat back outboard mounted side air bags deployed during the crash. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There was a 37 year old front right male passenger. His mid-instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed during the crash. He sustained moderate injuries and was transported to the trauma center, but his treatment status is unknown.
