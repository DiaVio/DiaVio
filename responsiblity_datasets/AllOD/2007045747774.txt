The crash occurred on a five-lane east/westbound roadway with two lanes in each direction divided by a left turn only lane. The asphalt road was dry, level, and curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 1869m and a posted speed limit of 72kmph/45mph. There were no traffic control devices. The crash happened on a weekday afternoon while traffic was moderate under sunny skies.

V1, a 2000 Chevy Tahoe four-door SUV with one occupant was traveling eastbound in lane two. A non-contact 1995 Dodge van turned left from a business driveway in front of and across the path of V1. V1 swerved to the left and braked to avoid the non-contact vehicle and began to yaw in a counter-clockwise direction as it continued traveling northeast in the westbound lanes. V1 rolled longitudinally to the right six quarter turns and landed on its top facing southwest straddling westbound lanes one and two. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, the Chevy Tahoe, was driven by a 29-year old male who was not injured. The driver reported that he was traveling form a previous business appointment to his office at about the speed limit. He said that he saw the non-contact vehicle turn across his path from the driveway to his right. He added that he steered left first and then braked (unknown lockup) to avoid the other vehicle. He added that as a result he lost control and rotated in a counter-clockwise direction before it rolled over to the right and landed on its top. He said he did not hit anything or any other vehicle.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was driver related overcompensation. Associated factors were assigned to V1 for driver behavior, recognition, inadequate surveillance - failure to look far enough ahead; exterior factor (the non-contact vehicle) forward direction; and driver behavior, performance, overcompensation.
