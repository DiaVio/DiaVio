The case vehicle a four-door 2000 Mercury Sable was in the center lane of the southbound lanes of a level and dry, six-lane asphalt divided highway. It was daylight and there was no adverse weather. Vehicle two (V2) a 2001 Lexus RX 300 SUV was also traveling in the center southbound lane. V2 began to slow for traffic ahead. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid a collision by steering to the left and grazed the left-rear bumper of V2. The case vehicle crossed the inside lane and struck the concrete median barrier with its front end riding up on the barrier in the process. The case vehicle flipped-over two-quarter turns, right side leading and came to rest on its roof facing north-northeast. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene. Both the 26-year-old female driver and the 15-year-old female right-front passenger were not restrained by three-point belts. However, the steering-wheel and the top instrument panel air bags deployed. The eleven-month old female right-rear passenger was in a child safety seat restrained by a three-point belt, but the belt routing is unknown. The case occupant is the driver. She was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries. The right-front passenger sustained minor injuries. The right-rear passenger was not injured.
