Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Honda Element SUV, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway at dawn under dry conditions. For unknown reasons, V1 drifted off the road to the left, where its left tires started to go down a downhill embankment causing V1 to rotate twenty degrees clockwise. V1 then struck a telephone pole with its front, knocking down the telephone pole. V1 continued forward after this impact and rotated another forty degrees clockwise when it struck a tree with its left side. V1 continued to the bottom of the downhill embankment where it came to final rest. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 21-year-old female and case study occupant, was the sole occupant of V1. She was wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt, had her buckle mounted pretensioner deploy and had both her frontal airbags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
