This case involves a single left side impact resulting in moderate injuries to the left rear passenger (case occupant #1) and severe injuries to the center rear occupant (case occupant #2). Scene The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two-lane bituminous rural roadway at a 3 way intersection controlled by a stop sign for the intersecting road which is a three lane road. The main road is level and separated by a double yellow line. The intersecting roadway extends northward crossing the main road as a private roadway. The intersecting road runs northwest and southeast from the intersection and the main road runs southwest-northeast. The intersecting roadway is a three lane road separated by a double yellow line with a left turn lane. The speed limit on both roadways is 45 mph (72 km/h). Vehicle The vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 four door Hyundai Elantra, was being driven in a northwesterly direction on the intersecting road approaching the stop sign and vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Peterbilt dump truck, was being driven in a northeasterly direction on the main roadway. Crash dynamics The crash occurred when V1 attempted to make a left turn onto the main roadway and crossed directly into the path of V2 resulting in the front plane of V2 impacting the left side plane of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing northeast off the shoulder to the north in the entrance to a private driveway. V2 came to rest facing north in the middle of the southbound lane. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. V2 was not towed from the scene. The driver 'side airbag' deployed. Both frontal airbags did not deploy. Occupants V1 was driven by a 29 year old female who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. Other occupants of V1 included a 57 year old male restrained by the 3-point manual belt in the right front seat, a 3 year old male restrained by the 5-point harness of a forward facing convertible seat in the left rear position, a 56 year old unbelted female in the center rear position, and a 3 month old female in a rear facing infant seat in the right rear position. The 3 year old male (case occupant #1) sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a pediatric trauma center by helicopter. The 56 year old female (case occupant #2) was transported with severe injuries to a trauma center by a combination of ground ambulance and helicopter. The driver and 3 month old child were transported with minor injuries to the nearest hospital emergency room by ground ambulance. The right front passenger of V1 and driver of V2 were not injured and not transported to a hospital. V2 was occupied by the driver only, a 67 year old male who was restrained with a 3-point manual belt.
