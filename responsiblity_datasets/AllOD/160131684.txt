Vehicle One (V1), a 2000 Honda Civic coupe, was traveling south in lane three of a three lane, one-way highway at dawn under dry conditions. For unknown reasons, V1 departed the roadway to the left, where it went down and embankment and then up the other side of the embankment, striking the uphill portion of the embankment with its front before striking a metal guardrail with its front. Immediately after this impact, the right front of V1 contacted a light pole. This impact rotated V1 counterclockwise about 180 degrees. As it rotated it struck the light pole again as it was falling with its right rear and then struck the guardrail again with its rear, coming to rest in the highway's median. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and the case study occupant was a 16-year-old male. He was properly wearing his three-point lap and shoulder belt and had his frontal airbag deploy. V1 also contained a right front passenger, a 17-year-old male who was unbelted but had his frontal airbag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital and then was transferred to a level-one trauma center for treatment. The passenger in V2 was not treated.
