A two vehicle daytime collision occurred in the northbound lanes of an urban arterial street. In the Â½ mile surrounding the crash, the roadway heads east/west, with the northbound lanes heading west. The road consists of four lanes of two-way traffic paved with bituminous asphalt. Thru the collision scene, the roadway is straight and level. The speed limit for the road is 48 kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the road was dry.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1988 Volvo 740 sedan with only a driver, was traveling west. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Toyota Camry sedan with a driver and passenger, was heading east in lane two. It is unknown what travel lane V1 was in initially, but immediately before the crash, V1 crossed over the centerline of the roadway into lane two then into lane one. In the process, the front right corner of V2 struck the right rear of V1. V1 was deflected clockwise and continued in a straight path off the roadway and into a utility pole where it came to rest. The driver of V2 braked prior to impact but could not avoid V1. V2 came to rest adjacent to the impact location. The driver of V1 was transported due to injuries, and both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
