This single vehicle rollover crash occurred on a rural two lane, two way road at night with dark conditions. The roadway was dry and conditions were clear. Case vehicle one ( V1), a 2000 Honda Accord two door coupe was northbound on this road that had a curve to the left. V1 completely departed the roadway in the curve to the right on to a gravel and grass area shoulder and then returned to the roadway after the curve. V1 then began to rotate counterclockwise as it crossed over both lanes of travel and departed the road to the left with a slip angle at about 40 degrees. The front of V1 then dropped down into a ditch with the front tires and front end impacting into the soft mud which began to lift the back end of V1 upward to begin a rollover. V1 then impacted the undercarriage and back end of V1 into the ground and then continued to roll over and then the front end of V1 impacted the ground. V1 then landed on all tires and came to final rest in a shrubbery facing south about 40 meters (130 feet) north of the point the roll over began. V1 was damaged and towed. The driver of the case vehicle is the case occupant. This case driver was a 22 year old male who was not restrained and sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center. A second occupant in V1 was a male seated in the front right restrained with a lap/shoulder belt and was treated at a local hospital.
