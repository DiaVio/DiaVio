This 77-year-old male case occupant was the driver of a 2007 Lincoln Town Car that was involved in a severe frontal collision with a tree. The case occupant was wearing the available three-point seat belt and the vehicle's frontal air bags deployed. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. The case occupant is 191 cm (75 inches) tall and weighs 113 kg (250 lbs). As the vehicle's front contacted the tree, the case occupant moved forward where his head contacted the steering wheel-mounted air bag, resulting in the case occupant's cheek and eyebrow lacerations. The case occupant's height and weight contributed to the overloading of the air bag causing his head to contact the air bag and the steering wheel rim, possibly resulting in the subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse axonal injury. Moving forward, the case occupant loaded the lap and shoulder belt resulting in the abdominal, shoulder and chest contusions. The case occupant's loading of the shoulder portion of the seat belt resulted in the right pneumothorax and right rib fractures. The case occupant's arms moved forward toward the intruding instrument panel. Contact of his right elbow with the intruding center instrument panel probably caused the right distal intra-atricular humerus and ulna fractures. The right lateral thigh contacted the center console resulting in the thigh contusion. As the case occupant moved forward his knees struck the intruding knee bolster, evident by bending, resulting in the right knee laceration. Contact with the knee bolster resulted in the loading of the pelvis causing the pubic symphysis and SI joint disruptions as well as the bilateral acetabulum fractures. The source of the occupant's bilateral scalp contusions could have been the steering wheel rim followed by contact to the windshield header.
