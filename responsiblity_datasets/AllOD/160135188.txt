Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Explorer utility vehicle, was traveling north in lane one of a two-lane leg of a four lane, divided traffic way under dry, daylight conditions. The roadway was on a downhill grade when for unknown reasons V1 departed the roadway to the right. V1's right tires rode up an uphill embankments causing V1 to enter into a flip over type rollover to the left. V1 completed four-quarter turns before coming to final rest on its wheels. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 63-year-old male and case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. The driver side stalk-mounted pretensioner fired and no air bags deployed. The driver of V1 was flown to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
