The case occupant is a 78 year old female driver, restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a severe head-on collision, with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This wrong-way crash occurred on an interstate freeway around dawn during wet, overcast weather conditions. This freeway consists of three southbound lanes separated from the three northbound lanes by a grassy median. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt travel lanes are straight and level. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mercury Sable four door sedan, had been traveling south in the southbound lanes. The driver of V1 pulled over for unknown reasons and then turned around and started traveling north in the southbound lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Subaru Impreza four door sedan, was traveling south in the southbound lanes. V1 and V2 were both traveling in the inside southbound lane, moving towards one another. The driver of V1 braked, but the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver's seat belt buckle pretensioner and the deployment of both frontal air bags. From the point of impact, V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing southeast, partially off the roadway. V2 traveled a short distance southeast and came to final rest in the grassy median. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 78 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's seat belt buckle pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
