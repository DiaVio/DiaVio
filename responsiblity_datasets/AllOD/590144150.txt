This case involved the belted male driver of a compact utility vehicle responding to an eight quarter-turn trip-over. The non-horizontal principal direction of force impact(s) produced 'severe' vehicle damage (as measured by crush to the greenhouse) and resulted in serious injury to the subject. This single vehicle crash occurred on a one-way transition ramp between adjacent multi-lane interstates traveling within an urban area. The single-lane ramp traveled westbound to southbound by branching off straight, and then made a sweeping right curve and down a slight grade, with a noticeable super-elevation inward. The south (left) side of the transition ramp consisted of a dirt shoulder followed by a, loose, gravel berm, and then relatively level, natural landscape. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry, during the early morning (dark-street lights) crash. The Case Vehicle (2004 Honda Element, 4-door compact utility) was traveling westbound in the number-one (of three) lane prior to the ramp branching off. The vehicle's first row lap and shoulder belts were pretensioner equipped and there were first row frontal-impact air bags, which did not deploy in this crash. The 26-year-old male driver (case subject sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint. The driver/subject continued straight instead of entering the right curve and allowed the vehicle to travel off of the left (east) side of the roadway. The subject, who may have obsereved an adjacent trafficway now directly in front of him, steered left as the vehicle encountered a loose gravel berm, causing the right front wheel to trip the vehicle and overturn eight quarter-turns to the right. The vehicle came to rest facing northeast in the landscape, between the interstates. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility due to serious neck injury.
