The crash occurred on a two-lane east/west roadway with no shoulders. The road makes a series of curves as it winds through a rural area. This particular crash took place in the westbound lanes near the apex of a long left curve with a radius of 351.5 meters. Conditions were daylight and sunny on a weekend afternoon. The posted speed limit was 48kph (30mph) on the level road and there was a curve warning sign with an advisory speed of 32kph (20mph).

Vehicle #1 was a 1993 Honda Accord traveling westbound. As the vehicle negotiated a curve to the left the vehicle's right wheels edged off the right (north) side of the road. The driver braked and steered left, overcompensating and going into the eastbound lane. The driver then steered right in an attempt to regain control and began a clockwise rotation. After leaving 20m of yaw marks, Vehicle 1 departed the right (north) side of the road and struck a curve warning sign and a tree as it rolled two quarter turns left-side-leading to the left into a ditch. The vehicle came to rest facing south 4m off the north side of the road on its top. The drop off from the road to the ditch has a -57% grade initially and then decreases to -33% at final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Accord (V1) was driven by a 20-year-old female college student who was belted in the crash. She had to be extricated by rescue personnel but refused medical transport. The police assigned her 'B' (non-incapacitating) injuries on their report. In her initial statement to police at the scene she stated that she reached over to the right to get some fast food she had just purchased out of the bag. She said she didn't take her eyes off the road, but must have pulled the steering wheel slightly to the right as she reached over which caused her to initially edge off the right side of the road. At the time of the crash the driver was on her way home from church, she was familiar with the vehicle and drove the road monthly.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #1 was this vehicle traveling off edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a recognition error, internal distraction. Associated factors that contributed to the crash included non-driving activities, retrieving object from floor and/or seat; and inadequate evasive action, other-overcompensation. The researcher felt that had she not overcompensated when the vehicle edged off the road the driver could have regained control without crashing. V1 was also traveling too fast for conditions - the speed limit was 48Kph (30mph) with an advisory sign recommending 32Kph (20mph). The driver admitted to traveling 64Kph (40mph) and based on physical scene evidence it appears the vehicle was traveling at an even higher rate of speed.
