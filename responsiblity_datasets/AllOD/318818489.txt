This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 70-year-old female belted driver with a deployed frontal airbag. This occupant was driving an intermediate size sedan when it was involved in a head-on collision with another intermediate size sedan. The vehicle sustained moderate damage. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred during midafternoon hours on a dry road in clear conditions. A 2011 Ford Fusion intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling southwest on a straight two-lane suburban road. A 1999 Honda Accord intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) was traveling northeast in the opposite direction on the same road negotiating a slight left curve. The road was bituminous and level in all directions. As the two vehicles came upon a business entrance, V2 began turning left across the oncoming lane of travel. V1 steered right in avoidance but the two vehicles collided head-on in a full frontal configuration (Event 1). V2 was pushed back while rotating rapidly counterclockwise 140 degrees, at which point its right plane impacted V1's left plane in a side-slap configuration (Event 2). V1 continued off the north edge of the road, impacting a mailbox with its front plane (Event 3). V1 came to rest on the north road side in a residential driveway. V2 came to rest in the road facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case vehicle was occupied by a 70-year-old female driver. She was belted as evidenced by 3 cm of lap belt payout, an indeterminate amount of shoulder belt payout, and heavy latch plate loading. The retractor pretensioner was actuated. No buckle or anchor pretensioners were installed. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed during the head-on impact. The available right instrument panel, first row outboard seatback, and side curtain airbags were non-deployed. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
