This case involves a left-frontal impact in off-set mode between the front-end of the case vehicle, a passenger car, and a compact SUV. The case vehicle, a 2012 four-door Nissan Sentra, was westbound on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt roadway. It was daylight and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2), a 2013 Honda CR-V compact SUV, was eastbound on the same roadway. V2 crossed the center-line and entered the path of the case vehicle. The front-left end of V2 struck the front-left end of the case vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate counterclockwise. The case vehicle came to rest straddling the east bound lane and the shoulder facing east-southeast. V2 came to rest straddling the shoulder and the roadside facing north. The restrained 25-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel mounted frontal-impact, seatback-mounted and roof side rail air bags. She sustained serious injuries. She was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
