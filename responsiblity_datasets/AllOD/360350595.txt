This case occupant is a 64 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a frontal air bag deployment who was involved in a moderate frontal collision. He sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early morning hours, in darkness with overhead street lights, in the eastbound lanes of a three lane, two way, state freeway. At the time of the crash, there were overcast weather conditions and dry travel lanes. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt lanes are straight with a downhill grade for eastbound traffic. There are paved shoulders on both sides and just west of where this crash occurred, there is a freeway onramp that merges with the eastbound travel lane. Adjacent to the south shoulder is a sloped embankment that leads to a shallow ditch. Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Ford Ranger compact pickup, was eastbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Dodge Ram large pickup, and Vehicle three (V3), a 1999 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, were stopped for traffic in the eastbound lane. As V1 approached the stopped vehicles, the driver braked and steered right but V1's front left impacted V2's back right, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. V1 underrode V2's rear bumper, then departed the roadway to the right and came to final rest facing southeast in the ditch. The force of the impact pushed V2 east and V2's front impacted the back of V3. V2 and V3 came to final rest near the center lane lines, facing east. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. V3 was driven from the scene. The case occupant in V1 is the 64 year old male driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the crash. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
