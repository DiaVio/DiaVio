The asphalt roadway had one travel lane lane in each direction, separated by a painted median, with a positive grade for northbound traffic. The posted speed limit was 80kmph (50mph). Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was initially traveling northbound when the driver lost control after attempting to avoid a deer crossing the roadway. V1 traveled off the roadway to the right (east), impacting a utility pole with its left side before rotating 180 degrees (facing west) to its final resting position. The driver was entrapped in the front section of V1 and extricated from the vehicle after 15 minutes. He was then transported from the scene to a local trauma center where he was admitted for 13 days for injuries received in the crash.
