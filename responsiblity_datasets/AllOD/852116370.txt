This crash occurred at night with street lights on three southbound freeway lanes with a fourth lane merging in from the left that are all divided from the northbound and local southbound connector lanes. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Civic hybrid four-door sedan was southbound in lane one of the four lanes. V2, a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica sport utility vehicle was traveling in lane 2. The freeway had a slight curve to the left when V1 departed the lane to the right and struck the front right corner of V1 into the barrier. V1 then moved left back across lane one and entered lane two when the left side of V1 impacted the right side of V2. The impact into V2 struck the right rear tire that caused V2 to be forced to the right and continued contact with V1. Both vehicles crossed over lane one and departed the roadway right where the front of both vehicles impacted the cement barrier. When V1 impacted the barrier it climbed over the barrier and went airborne and then rolled over and landed on the driver's side in the local southbound lanes. V1 then bounced off the left side and returned back upright on a four tires at final rest. V2 continued to swipe down the concrete barrier and came to final rest on the west shoulder. Both vehicles were towed disabled and the V1 hybrid battery was not damaged. The case occupant, a 53-year-old male, was the front right passenger of V1 who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder seat belt and the frontal air bag deployed. The driver, a 28-year-old female, who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder seat belt and had both the frontal and seat side-impact air bags deployed, deceased at scene. The case occupant was transported to the trauma center.
