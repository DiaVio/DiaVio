This case involves a moderate frontal impact resulting in thorax, spine and extremity injuries to the left front case occupant (driver). Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2010 Honda Pilot 4-door SUV was travelling west on a two-lane, two-way roadway with parking lanes on each side. The crash occurred during afternoon daylight hours. The weather was clear, and the roadway was dry and free of defect. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 40 km/h (25 mph). The crash occurred when the driver of V1 had an adverse health event, causing him to momentarily lose consciousness. The case vehicle drifted to the left over the double yellow centerline, across the eastbound lane of travel, and up onto the sidewalk. The case vehicle impacted a parking sign with an unknown area of the front bumper, and then impacted a temporary chain link fence with the left front bumper. As the vehicle continued moving forward along the fence line, the fence collapsed and flew over the vehicle, damaging the right side. Finally, V1 impacted a brick pillar at the entranceway to a business before coming to final rest in the yard facing southwest. The 58 year old male driver (case occupant) of V1 was restrained using his available 3-point lap and shoulder belt with pretensioner. The steering wheel-mounted frontal, side curtain, and seatback-mounted thorax airbags all deployed for the case occupant's seating position. He was transported to a level one trauma center for treatment of thorax, spine, and extremity injuries.
