On the roadside, the left tires of V1 dug into the soft ground and V1 rolled two quarter turns to the left. V1 came to rest on its top. It was towed due to damage and the lone occupant was transported to the hospital with minor injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a 19 year-old female, stated that she was negotiating the curve when the back of her vehicle started to fishtail. She then stated that she hit the brakes but the car would not regain control.
