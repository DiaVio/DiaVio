This crash occurred in a 3-legged urban intersection. The main leg of the intersection is situated in an east to west configuration and is comprised of 3 travel lanes in each direction with a dedicated right turn lane at the west leg of the trafficway. The east and westbound lanes are separated by a raised median without a positive barrier. The third leg of the intersection enters from the south and is comprised of 2 undivided travel lanes. The intersection is controlled by a traffic signal that was functioning properly. At the time of the crash it was early morning and dark, the street lights were lit. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Traffic for that time of the day is light. Involved in the crash was the case vehicle (V1) a 2000 Ford Mustang SVT 2-door coupe equipped with manual 3-point lap and shoulder restraints for each seating position. In addition to the manual restraints V1 is also equipped with driver and right passenger frontal impact air bags, both of which deployed in the crash. The driver of V1, our case subject, was a 29-year-old male. He was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. The right front seat was occupied by a 21-year-old male. He was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. Also involved in the crash was the Principal Other Vehicle (POV) (V2) a 1996 Ford Aerostar mini van. V1 was traveling in an easterly direction in the first through lane. V2 was traveling in a northerly direction in the proper lane. V2 was stopped at the intersection waiting to make a left turn. As V1 proceeded east, V2 entered the intersection to turn left. The front of V1 struck V2 in the left side. An imprint of V2's LR wheel was seen on the right side of V1's front bumper. After this impact, V1 rotated in a counterclockwise direction as V2 also rotated counterclockwise. V1 and V2 struck a second time in a sideslap impact. An imprint of V2's LF wheel was seen on the LF door of V1. This sideslap impact caused V2 to change rotational direction and it rotated clockwise to its final rest position across the third eastbound travel lane facing in a northwesterly direction. After the sideslap impact, V1 came to final rest in the middle of the second eastbound lane facing in an easterly direction. The driver of the case vehicle struck his head against the left "A" pillar and windshield in the impact. In spite of the head contact it was reported the driver did not loose consciousness in the crash. He was awake when the paramedics arrived. The driver was not physically entrapped in the vehicle however the LF door was jammed and needed to be cut open to remove the driver. The driver was transported by ground ambulance to the trauma center under a "High Suspicion of Injury" criterion. The right front occupant was also transported to the trauma center but is not a subject of study.
