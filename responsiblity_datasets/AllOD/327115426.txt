This case involves a severe impact between the left side of a compact SUV and the front end of a full-size passenger car. The case occupants are row-two passengers in child restraint systems seated in the left and right outboard positions. The left rear passenger was seated in a forward facing car seat. The seat was improperly secured to the seat with the center lap and shoulder belt routed around the left-rear head restraint and buckled in the receiver for the left-rear belt. The latch of the right-rear three-point belt was buckled into the receiver for the center-rear belt. The left-rear (nearside) passenger sustained AIS one injuries, but the right-rear (far-side) passenger sustained a serious brain injury. The case vehicle, a 2004 Ford Escape compact SUV was southbound on a dry, level, two-lane, asphalt road approaching a four-leg intersection. It was dark and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2), 2007 Nissan Altima was westbound on the intersecting two-lane road approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, the front of V2 struck it on the left side. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate counterclockwise as they departed the intersection at the southwest corner. The case vehicle struck a stop sign before coming to rest facing north in a field beyond the roadside. V2 came to rest facing west-northwest in the same field, west of the case vehicle. The restrained 26-year-old female driver, the 3-year-old male left-rear and 6-year-old male right-rear passengers were the only occupants of the case vehicle. The driver sustained police-reported non-incapacitating injuries. The 3-year-old male left-rear passenger sustained minor injuries and the 6-year-old male right-rear passenger sustained serious injuries. The driver was transported to an outside hospital. The row-two passengers were transported to a pediatric level-one trauma center and enrolled as case occupants.
