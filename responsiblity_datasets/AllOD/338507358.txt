This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an 81-year-old male belted driver with deployed side airbags. This occupant was driving a five-door subcompact hatchback when he sustained serious injuries in a right-angle crash with a large utility vehicle. The crash occurred early on a rainy afternoon on a wet road. A 2009 Toyota Yaris five-door subcompact hatchback (Vehicle 1) was traveling west on the on-ramp towards a one-way, three-lane interstate roadway. The grade for V1 was minimal. A 2004 Isuzu Ascender large utility vehicle (Vehicle 2) was traveling west in the left lane of the interstate roadway also with minimal grade. V1 reached the end of the on-ramp. The slow travel speed indicated by the EDR and the hard left turn described by the investigating police officer suggest the driver may have been disoriented to the driving situation. V1 turned left across the highway and was struck on the left plane by the front plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 continued towards the median and struck the guardrail with its front (Event 2), coming to rest against the guardrail. V2 came to rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by an 81-year-old male driver. He was belted with a non-actuated retractor pretensioner. The left curtain and left outboard seatback airbags were deployed. The available steering wheel hub, right instrument panel, right curtain, and right outboard seatback airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries.
