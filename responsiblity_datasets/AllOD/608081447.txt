This case involves an off-set frontal impact to the case vehicle by the front end of a compact passenger car, resulting in critical injuries to the 34-year-old male driver. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The case vehicle a 2004 four-door Chevrolet Malibu was northbound on a dry, level, two-lane concrete road. It was daylight and clear. Vehicle two (V2) a 2006 four-door Chevrolet Cobalt and a non-contact vehicle were southbound on the same road. V2 drifted off the west edge of the roadway causing the right wheels to drop onto the shoulder. The driver of V2 attempted to return to the roadway, over-corrected and lost control of the vehicle. V2 entered a counterclockwise yaw, crossed the center-line, enter the path of the case vehicle and the front of V2 struck the front of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise and the left-side of the case vehicle side-slapped the right-side of V2. The case vehicle departed the roadway, traversed the east banked shoulder and rolled two-quarter turns before coming to rest face west on the roadside. V2 came to rest in the southbound lane facing east. V3 a 2002 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, contacted the left side of V2 as it came to a rest in the southbound lane. The case occupant is the 34year-old male driver and sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He sustained critical injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
