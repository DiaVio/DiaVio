This case involves moderate front left corner impact resulting in severe injury to the right front seat passenger (case occupant). The crash occurred during day time in dry and clear weather, with excessive sun glare for the southbound traffic. The collision occurred at a three way intersection of a through two-way two-lane bituminous roadway with two-way two-lane bituminous roadway governed by a stop sign. The roadway is level and separated by a double yellow line. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 four-door Chrysler PT Cruiser, was being driven northbound and vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab pick up, was being driven southbound. The crash occurred when V2 initiated a left hand turn and entered the path of V1. The front plane of V2 impacted the front plane of V1 in a front left corner impact configuration for V1. V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing southeast in the northbound lane and V2 came to rest facing east in the northbound lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by a 23 year old male restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The case occupant, a 14 year old female, was seated in the right front passenger seat and restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. Her frontal air bag deployed during the crash. The driver and right front passenger were transported by ground unit to the nearest hospital with minor and severe injuries, respectively. The case occupant was subsequently transferred to a trauma center.
