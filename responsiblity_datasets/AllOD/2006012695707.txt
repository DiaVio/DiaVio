This crash occurred in the late evening of a weekend on the right roadside of a two-lane east/west roadway. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with a downhill slope and a posted speed of 89 kmph (55 mph). The traffic was minimal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1996 Saturn SL1 4-door with one occupant, was westbound in lane one. As V1 continued westbound it departed the roadway to the right and began rotating clockwise. The left rear wheel contacted a sewer pipe in a ditch, causing the wheel to brake off. The vehicle then rolled left two-quarter turns before coming to final rest on its roof. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a 22-year old male, reported minor injuries. He advised that he had just left his wife's work and was on his way home. He stated that he was driving down the road at approximately 89 kmph (55 mph) when he thought that the tie rod broke, causing him loose control. He claimed that he tried to brake and steer left but could not avoid departing the roadway.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a driver related factor, poor directional control. There was no evidence of the tie rod breaking prior to the crash. It was in fact the impact with the ditch that caused the wheel to brake off and the vehicle to roll over.
