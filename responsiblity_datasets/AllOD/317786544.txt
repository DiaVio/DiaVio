This crash involves a restrained 56 year old female driver in a 2015 Kia Forte (V1). V1 was equipped with dual side curtains, and dual frontal and side airbags. The frontal steering wheel mounted airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a two-way, two-lane curved asphalt roadway. The posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph). There were no adverse weather conditions. The westbound travel lane had a downhill slope. V1 was traveling west in the westbound lane of the roadway while negotiating a right-hand curve. V1 drifted over the left lane line and then departed the roadway to the left. While on the roadside V1 contacted a sign with its front (event 1). V1 continued a short distance and contacted a small tree with left side (event 2). After contacting the small tree, V1 continued and contacted two rocks with its undercarriage (events 3 & 4). After contacting the second rock V1 went airborne and contacted a large tree with its right front (event 5). V1, while still airborne, contacted the same tree with its right rear (event 6). This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and lands with its left side against two large trees (events 7 & 8) and its left front against a smaller tree (event 9). V1 faced north at final rest while on the roadside. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by air. She was treated for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
