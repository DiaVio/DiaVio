The vehicle was in lane 1 intending to turn right (north), as the driver applied the brakes and steered right the vehicle slide straight ahead across the northbound lanes contacting a snow bank. V1 was than redirected across the southbound lanes where it struck a utility pole on the western roadside and came to final rest.
