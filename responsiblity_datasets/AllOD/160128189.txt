Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Civic Hybrid Sedan, was traveling west in lane two of a two lane roadway under dry, dark conditions. This two lane roadway is part of a six lane, divided trafficway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Nissan 350Z Coupe, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane roadway, part of the same six lane, divided trafficway. V2 departed the roadway to the right, where it struck a metal guardrail with its front right. After this impact V2 bounced back onto the roadway and started skidding counterclockwise. V2 continued to skid across the eastbound lanes and over the median, entering the westbound lanes. The front of V1 then struck the right side of V2. This impact pushed V1 backwards and off the road to the south. After the impact with V1, V2 was pushed off the road to the south where it struck a light pole with its rear and then caught fire. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and the case study occupant was a 46 year-old male. He was wearing his three-point lap and shoulder belt and his buckle-mounted pretensioner fired. Both frontal airbags deployed in V1 as well as the driver side seat-mounted side thorax bag. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for his injuries. The driver of V2 was pronounced dead on the scene.
