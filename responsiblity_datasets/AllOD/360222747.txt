This near side impact crash case involves a 75 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a deployed side impact air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a four legged intersection controlled by traffic signals. The east-west roadway consists of two east and two westbound lanes, with left turn only lanes available at the intersection. The north-south roadway consists of one northbound lane, one southbound lane, and one left turn only lane on the north side of the intersection. Both roadways are comprised of asphalt and in the area where the crash occurred, there is a downhill grade for northbound vehicles and an uphill grade for eastbound vehicles. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Ford Focus station wagon, was in the northbound lane, intending to make a left turn at the intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2002 Nissan Xterra compact utility vehicle, was traveling east in lane one on the intersecting street. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the deployment of the driver's side air bag. V1 was pushed eastbound as it rotated counterclockwise, and the left front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V1 came to final rest on the east side of the intersection, facing west. V2 came to final rest near V1, facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 75 year old female driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the first crash event, this case occupant's seat back mounted side air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
