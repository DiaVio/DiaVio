This single vehicle rollover crash occurred at night with street lights at an interchange between two interstate highways. The weather conditions involved freezing rain and the roadway was icy. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Ranger extended cab four-door pickup truck was northbound and exited the off ramp that made a long curve to the right before merging into the two eastbound freeway lanes. As V1 reached the end of the ramp it began to rotate clockwise and slid laterally over the paved shoulder before going off the roadway to the right. V1 then continued to slide laterally and the tires dug into the soft gravel shoulder which then tripped the V1 to rollover to the left down a large muddy and grassy embankment. Numerous gouges and contacts with the ground occurred and appeared V1 rolled three complete times (12 quarter turns) and came to final rest upright facing south west over a barbed wire fencing. V1's roof and body was damaged and V1 was towed. The case occupant was the front right passenger who was 51 year old female wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt. She was seriously injured and transported to the trauma center. The male driver was also injured and transported to a local hospital.
