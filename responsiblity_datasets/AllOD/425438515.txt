A 2001 Buick Century sedan (V2) was traveling southwest on an urban, bituminous, four-lane, two-way roadway approaching the same intersection intending to continue straight. The grade was level for V2. V1 began turning left at the intersection as V2 continued straight. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2 (Event 1). V1 rotated clockwise after impact and came to rest near the point of impact. V2 continued off the roadway to the left into a bush, where it struck a pedestrian with its front plane (Event 2) who was sitting in the bushes. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 79-year-old, female case occupant. She was not belted and her retractor pretensioner was not actuated. No airbags deployed. This occupant position had airbags available in the steering wheel hub, knee bolster, outboard seatback, and left roof side rail.
