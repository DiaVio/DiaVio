The case occupant is the 180 cm, 105 kg (5 ft 11 in, 232 lb), 22-year-old male driver of a 2006 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, 4-door sedan that was struck in the left side (T-type) by the front of a 2002 GMC Envoy, 4-door utility vehicle at a 90-degree angle. The impact was classified as severe and the WinSMASH reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 38 km/h (24 mph) which appeared to be slightly low when compared to the observed vehicle damage. The case occupant was using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag did not deploy. On impact, he moved to his left, relative to the vehicle interior, in response to the 9 o'clock direction of force. He sustained a loss of consciousness from which he never regained consciousness, a left scalp laceration and a left forehead laceration probably from contact with the intruding B-pillar. He sustained a thoracic aortic rupture, bilateral lung contusions, diaphragmatic rupture, five rib fractures with hemo-pneumothorax and a left scapula fracture from contact with the rear upper quadrant of the intruding left-front door. He sustained, left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures, a left sacral ala fracture, a left anterior acetabular fracture, and a splenic laceration from hip and abdomen contact with the armrest in the lower-rear quadrant of the intruding left-front door. He also sustained a urethra injury and a colon perforation from the pelvic fractures. He also sustained a liver laceration and bilateral kidney contusions from contact with the center console/armrest. The case occupant went into multi-system organ failiure and expired from his injuries 17 days post-crash.
