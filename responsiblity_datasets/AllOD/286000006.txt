This case involves a single frontal crash event resulting in serious injuries to the right rear passenger (case occupant). The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a five lane divided road (two through lanes north, left turn lane, raised median, two lanes south). The traffic at the intersection is controlled by overhead traffic lights. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Honda Odyssey, minivan was being driven northbound approaching the intersection and vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Ford F350, full-size pickup was being driven southbound. The speed limit on the road is 72 km/h (45 mph) both ways. The crash occurred when V2 attempted to make a left turn onto the eastbound roadway and crossed into the path of V1 resulting in the front plane of V2 impacting the front plane of V1. V1 and the V2 rotated counterclockwise, remained engaged and came to rest in the northbound lanes, V1 facing northwest and V2 facing east at FRP. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. The case occupant is a 10 year old male restrained by the 3-point manual belt in the right second row position. The case occupant was transported by ground ambulance to a nearby emergency room and was diagnosed with abdominal injury with abdominal contusion. V1 was driven by a 42 year old female who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. Both the steering wheel mounted air bag and the front passenger air bag deployed due to the crash. Other occupants of V1 included a 15 year old male restrained by the 3-point manual belt in the right front seat, a 13 year old male restrained by the 3-point manual belt in the left second row position. The V2 was occupied by the driver only, a 49 year old male restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The driver of V1 sustained moderate injuries and was transported by ground ambulance to a nearby emergency room. The remaining two V1 occupants were transported by ground ambulance to a nearby emergency room with minor injuries. The driver of V2 was not injured and not transported to a hospital.
