This frontal crash case involves a 48 year old restrained female seated in the front left seating position (Driver) with a deployed air bag who sustained moderate injuries. The crash occurred during the evening hours in wet and rainy weather. The collision occurred within the confines of a 4-way angled intersection controlled by traffic lights. At this intersection there are four (- 3 % grade), bituminous northbound travel lanes (two straight and one left and one right turn lane) that curve to the left. There are five (+ 2.3 % grade) bituminous southbound lanes (two straight and two left and one right turn lane). The north and south travel lanes leading up to the intersection limits are divided by a guardrail. There are three level, bituminous travel lanes (one westbound lane and two eastbound lanes) for V2's direction. The case vehicle (V1), a 2004 Ford Escape, was being driven northbound (far right straight lane) and vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Jeep Cherokee, was being driven eastbound. The crash occurred when V2, for unknown reasons, entered into the intersection and impacted its front right with the front left of V1. After initial impact, V1 traveled in a northeast direction before it came to its final resting position in the northeast quadrant of the intersection. After initial impact, V2 rotated counter clockwise 180 degrees before traveling to its final resting position in the north central area of the intersection facing west. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 49 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (buckle type pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted air bag did deploy as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned between middle and forward most and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to a level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of her injuries.
