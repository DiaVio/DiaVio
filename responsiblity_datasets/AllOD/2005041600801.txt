The crash occurred in the intersection of a five lane, four-way intersection controlled by traffic lights. There were three eastbound lanes: lane one and two were through lanes and lane three was a left turn-only lane. There were three westbound lanes: lane one was a right turn-only lane and lane two and three were through lanes. It was mid-afternoon on a weekday and skies were clear and roads were dry. The traffic flow was normal and the road was straight and level. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle #1 was a 1995 Chevrolet G-series van that was traveling east in lane three attempting to make a left hand turn at the intersection. The traffic signal was solid green for both east and westbound traffic and the driver of V1 entered the intersection as Vehicle #2, a 1998 Honda Accord, entered the intersection traveling westbound in lane two going straight. The Chevrolet van attempted to make the left hand turn and turned into the left side of Vehicle #2. V1 sideswiped V2, pulling apart the front left quarter panel. The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 and was issued a ticket for a left turn violation and for having an invalid driver's license. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.
