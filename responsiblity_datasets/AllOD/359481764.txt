This case occupant is a 30 year old male driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and who was involved in a frontal crash followed by a moderate rollover and back end guardrail impact. His frontal air bag deployed during the crash and he sustained critical injuries. This crash occurred on a four lane one way, interstate freeway in darkness with overhead street lights under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. In V1's precrash area, the concrete travel lanes are straight and level. On the east side of the freeway, there is a paved shoulder with periodic guardrails present. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Dodge Caliber five door hatchback, was northbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2009 Ford E-350 van, was traveling north in lane two, ahead of V1. V1 approached V2 at a higher rate of speed. The driver of V1 steered left, but V1's front right impacted the back of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's driver side frontal air bag. V1 continued a short distance north and began to rotate counterclockwise. With its right side leading, V1 rolled over eight quarter turns as it traveled towards the east shoulder. V1 crossed the shoulder and the back of V1 impacted the guardrail. V1 came to final rest on the east shoulder, facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene. The case occupant in V1 is the 30 year old male driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained critical injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
