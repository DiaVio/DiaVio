This frontal crash case involves a 50 year old restrained male with a deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occured during the night time hours in dry and clear weather (exit ramp was icy). The collision occured on a three lane (one northbound lane divided by a median and two southbound lanes) curved, concrete off-ramp. The northbound off-ramp ( 1 1/2 % positive grade) and is divided by a raised curb median with vegetation. The case vehicle (V1) a 2007 four-door Nissan Altima was being driven northbound and vehicle two (V2) a 2002 four- door Lexus RX300 SUV was being driven southbound. The crash occured when V2, lost control on the icy off-ramp, traveled over the median and directly into the path of V1 resulting in a full frontal crash configuration for both vehicles. Both vehicles rotated slightly after initial impact before traveling to final rest in the middle of the Northbound off-ramp. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. V1 was driven by the 50 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The retractor type pretensioner did actuate for the case occupant's seating position. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact and there was complete steering wheel column collapse noted. The case occupant was moderately injuried and transported to our CIREN center by ambulance.
