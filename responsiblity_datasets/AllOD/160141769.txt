This frontal crash case involves a 33-year-old restrained male with a deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred at night under dry and clear conditions. The crash occurred on a two lane, two-way roadway with a curve and divided by a solid double line. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2003 Jaguar X-Type sedan being driven westbound. Vehicle two (V2) is a 2003 Volvo S80 sedan and was being driven eastbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, crossed the centerline and the front of V1 struck the front of V2. Vehicle one came to final rest in-between the two travel lanes and vehicle came to rest off the roadway on the east shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by the 33-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. V1 also contained two other, non-case study occupants. A 25-year-old female was in the right front seat and was wearing the available 3-point manual belt and had the instrument panel mounted air bag deploy. A 24-year-old female was in the middle rear seat and was wearing the available 3-point manual belt. The driver and case study occupant in V1 was transported by helicopter to a level-one trauma center for treatment with serious injuries and the two passengers were both transported by ambulance to treatment.
