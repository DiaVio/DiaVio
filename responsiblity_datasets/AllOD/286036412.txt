Vehicle one (V1-case vehicle), a 2000 Ford Focus, 2-door hatchback was traveling eastbound in the far right lane of a three-lane divided highway with a slight left curve. At the time of the crash it was dark with no street lights, the weather was clear, and the bituminous roadway was dry.

There Rollover damage on the right side and top of V1 indicated that the vehicle's roll was limited to two quarter turns. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
