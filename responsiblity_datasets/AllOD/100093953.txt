This case involved an unbelted, male, driver responding to a frontal impact with a wooden utility pole and air bag deployment.

This single vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane roadway in a primarily residential area. The winding north/south roadway has a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. For northbound travel there was a sweeping left curve and a slight negative grade. The curve gave way to a straight section of roadway. The curbed roadway had no shoulders and numerous wooden utility poles line both sides. The weather was cloudy but the bituminous roadway was dry during the early morning (dark-not lit), weekend crash.

The case vehicle (2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser, 4-door hatchback) was traveling northbound at an undetermined speed, down the slight hill and negotiating the left curve. The case vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts (front pretensioners) and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The driver (subject/sole occupant) was not using the belt restraint.

The physical plant of the scene and the evidence from the crash indicated that as V1 negotiated the left curve, the vehicle traveled off of the right side (east) of the roadway and into an adjoining street ("T" intersection). The driver of V1 steered left and maintained a straight trajectory back into the northbound lane, across the double yellow lines, off of the left side (west) of the roadway and struck a wooden utility pole with two steel pipes and a telephone equipment box placed in front of it. V1's frontal impact air bags deployed. The pipes and equipment box appeared to have been attached to the pole. The impact caused the pole to shear several meters above the ground while the base remained, relatively, intact. The vehicle came to rest against the pole without rotation.

The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The driver was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury as rated by police.
