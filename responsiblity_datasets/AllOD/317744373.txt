This case involves a 92-year-old female who was 163 centimeters (5 foot 4 inches) tall and weighed 66 kilograms (145 pounds). She was the belted right front seat passenger of a 2015 Ford Fusion four-door sedan involved in a moderate severity crash to the left fender. The left side of the case vehicle was contacted by the front of a 2006 GMC Sierra large pickup truck. The principal direction of force was 9 o'clock. The left outboard seat mounted airbag and left side curtain both deployed during the crash. There was also a fatality of the driver who was also belted in the case vehicle; however, this case focuses on the driver. On impact the case occupant moved inboard and slightly rearward in relationship to the vehicle. The left intraventricular hemorrhage, bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages, left frontal bone fracture, inferior orbital wall fracture, nasal bone fracture, forehead laceration and facial abrasions as well as the C2 fracture were attributed to the face contacting the right side of the left front seatback. The bilateral rib fractures and left pneumothorax were caused by probable contact to the driver's seatback or possible contact to the center console. The T2, T6, T11, L1, L2, and L3 fractures were attributed to probable contact with the seatback. The colon laceration, small bowel laceration, and grade I splenic laceration were attributed to the seatbelt. The pelvic fractures were attributed to the lap belt or the center console. The right proximal tibia fracture was attributed to the center instrument panel.
