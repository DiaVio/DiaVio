This two-vehicle collision occurred during daytime hours on a weekend. The crash occurred at the intersection of an east-west roadway, and a north-south roadway, both of which have a posted 64 kmph (40 mph) speed limit. The intersection is controlled by tri-light traffic signals. Both roadways are two-way, seven-lane, bituminous roadways. At the time of the crash, the roadways were free of defects, and there were no adverse weather conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse 2-door coupe, was stopped facing westbound in the fourth lane (left turn only), just past the intersection mouth, and was waiting to turn left into southbound traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 BMW 325IS 2-door coupe, was traveling eastbound in the first lane, and approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. As V2 entered the intersection during the green phase of the tri-light, V1 executed a left turn. The front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest facing west in the eastbound lanes. V1 fled the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 36-year-old female driver of V1 fled the scene, but turned herself in to police later. She could not be interviewed, but the police indicated that she was 8-months pregnant and that she was on her way to her baby shower at the time of the crash. The witness statements reported by the police and the dynamics of the crash tend to indicate that critical reason for the crash is attributable to the decision error on the part of V1's driver, rather than a recognition error. One witness indicated that the turning maneuver seemed very sudden. Also, V2 was struck on the aft end of its left side, indicating that it had probably already entered the intersection as V1 began its turn.
