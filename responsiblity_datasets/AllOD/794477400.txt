This case involves an impact between the front-end of a large SUV and a tree. The case occupant is the unrestrained 72-year-old male driver. The case vehicle, a 2013 Mazda CX-9 SUV was travelling north on a dry, level, asphalt private parking lot toward the driveway that accesses the street. It was daylight and cloudy. The case vehicle departed the north side of the driveway and struck a 40-cm tree in a narrow, left-off-set mode and came to rest against the tree facing north-northeast. The driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel mounted air bag deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
