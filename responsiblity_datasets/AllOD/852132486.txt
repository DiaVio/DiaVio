This single vehicle crash occurred at night with no street lights on a two lane, two way street that had a curve to the left. It was raining at the time of the crash and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Impala four door sedan, was southbound on this street and was negotiating this curve to the left and lost control. V1 started to rotate counterclockwise almost 90 degrees and departed the roadway to the left after the curve. V1 slid laterally across a gravel driveway before the right side fender area of V1 impacted a large tree. V1 then rotated rapidly counterclockwise almost 360 degrees into a ditch with standing water and mud. V1 then rolled over to the right and came to final rest on the roof top facing east with the front half of V1 in ditch with mud and standing water, and the back half partially on the east road edge. V1 was damaged and towed. The driver is the only one in V1 and is the case occupant. This case driver is a 37 year old male who was not belted in the far side impact crash. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being airlifted to the trauma center.
