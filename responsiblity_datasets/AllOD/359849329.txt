This severe frontal crash involved two case occupants, a driver and front right passenger, who were both belted with air bag deployments and sustained multiple moderate severity injuries. This crash occurred at night under street lights, at an intersection during clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Honda Accord four door sedan, was eastbound on a three lane, two way street with a center left turn lane present. V1 approached the intersection to make a left turn at a high rate of speed and entered the left turn lane. V1 began to brake, leaving skid marks that curve to the left toward the northeast corner of the intersection. V1's front right tire impacted the curb, causing minor rim damage. The tire deflated and V1 continued off the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The front of V1 then impacted a steel light pole on the northeast corner. V1 came to final rest facing northeast into the pole. V1 was towed and disabled. The driver and front right passenger are both case occupants with no other passengers in the vehicle. The driver is a 22 year old male who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt with a pretensioner. His front steering wheel mounted, side seatback mounted, and left roof side rail mounted curtain air bags all deployed on impact. He sustained multiple moderate severity injuries and was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to the trauma center. The front right passenger is a 22 year old female who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt with a pretensioner, and her front instrument panel mounted, side seatback mounted, and right roof side rail mounted curtain air bags all deployed on impact. She sustained multiple moderate severity injuries and was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to the trauma center.
