Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder 4-door sport-utility vehicle (SUV), was traveling west in lane four of a four lane, one way limited access highway under dark, clear conditions. V1 drove over a patch of ice in the roadway and started to skid counterclockwise off the road to the left. V1's left front then struck the concrete barrier on the left shoulder of the roadway. This impact rotated V1 clockwise where its left rear struck the concrete barrier on the left side of the roadway. V1 then continued to rotate counterclockwise, coming to final rest in lane four facing oncoming traffic. Vehicle one was not towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 34-year-old male and case study occupant, was wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and the seat mounted head and thorax side bag deployed. The driver of V1 then drove home and then drove himself to the hospital the next day.
