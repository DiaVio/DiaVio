This near-side crash involves a 35-year-old male restrained male case occupant with frontal airbag deployment who received serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred at the intersection of a four lane, north-south trafficway divided by a raised median and a six lane, east-west trafficway divided by a raised median. The intersection was controlled by a four-way traffic light. The case vehicle (V1), a 2003 Nissan Sentra sedan, was being driven northbound while vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse couple, was being driven eastbound. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to make a left turn from the northbound roadway onto the westbound roadway. As V1 attempted to make the turn, the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest in the southeast portion of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 35-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. V1 also contained a 35-year-old female in the right front seat who was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt, an 8-year-old female in the right rear seat who was properly wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and a two year old male in the left rear seat who was in a forward facing, convertible child saftey seat. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment. The other three occupants were all treated and released at a local hospital.
