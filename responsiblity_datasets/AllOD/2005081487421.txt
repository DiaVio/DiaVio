A three vehicle daytime collision occurred during the morning rush hour. The collision occurred in the southbound lanes of an undivided rural highway, in lane one. The pre-crash roadway for both vehicles is a straight, dry and level bituminous roadway. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Toyota Celica, was driven by a 22 year-old male who was traveling southbound on the roadway in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Dodge Neon driven by a 19 year-old female with one passenger, was traveling southbound in lane one. Vehicle three (V3), a 2003 Saturn Vue, was parked in a parking lot on the east side of the roadway. V1 was attempting to make a U-turn. V1 first moved to the right to swing wide, and then turned left in front of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. V2 continued in a southeast direction and impacted a chain-link fence, and then impacted parked V3. V2 came to rest against the front of V3. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: illegal maneuver. Inadequate surveillance was an associative factor for this driver for failing to look in his rearview mirror prior to making his U-turn. It was the first time the driver had driven on this road and he was on his way to visit a friend. He was looking at forward traffic after he had realized he missed his turn and decided to make a U-turn in the middle of the roadway, an illegal maneuver.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line. The critical reason for the critical event is not coded to this vehicle.
