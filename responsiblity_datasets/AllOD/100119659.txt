This case involved a 20-year-old belted female driver responding to a 'severe' full frontal impact into the back of a semi trailer with case vehicle frontal impact air bag deployment. The 12 o'clock principal direction of force, high delta V impact resulted in only moderate injury to the subject. This single vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a, divided, multi-lane interstate traveling through an urban area. There were five lanes for southbound travel with a paved shoulder wide enough to accommodate vehicles in case of emergency. The trafficway was straight with a slight grade decline for southbound traffic. The weather was clear and the concrete trafficway dry during the morning (daylight) crash. The Case Vehicle (2003 Hyundai Elantra, 4-door sedan) was traveling southbound in the number-one (far right) lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, first row frontal impact air bags and first row seat back mounted air bags. The 20-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, based on physical evidence. A semi tractor-trailer was legally parked along the west (right) roadside in an emergency status, the driver had just placed orange safety cones. The driver/subject believes she must have diverted her eyes from the traffic for a second or two and does not recall anything else. Reconstruction shows the subject's vehicle leaving the trafficway at a gradual right angle until striking the back of the trailer with its front plane, entirely distributed across the front plane with an underride pattern of engagement. The case vehicle's frontal impact, and the front right seat-back mounted side impact, air bags deployed. The case vehicle rotated slightly clockwise as it underrode the trailer and came to rest against the trailer facing southwest. The driver/case subject was transported to a trauma facility due to moderate injury.
