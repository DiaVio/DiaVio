This case involved the 46 year old restrained female driver of a 2011 Nissan Rogue four door wagon (V1). She was involved in a head on collision with a 2001 Chrysler Town & Country Van (V2). There was a third vehicle in the crash, a 2008 Nissan Sentra four door sedan (V3) which came in contact with V2 only. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a straight two lane roadway with a 2.5% grade. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit for the north/south roadway was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was traveling south at approximately 72 kph (45 mph) with an uphill grade. V2 and V3 were northbound on the downhill grade. V3 had stopped in the roadway waiting to make a left turn onto an intersecting roadway. V2 was traveling at approximately 97 kph (60 mph) in the same travel lane as V3. V2 swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid impact with V3. V2 struck the left rear bumper corner of V3 and continued on into the southbound lane of traffic. V2 then struck V1 in a head on configuration. V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees and departed the west side of the road for final rest. V2 came to final rest still in the southbound lane. V3 came to rest just forward of impact in the northbound travel lane. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V3 was not disabled and was driven from the scene. The driver of V1 was utilizing the available manual lap and shoulder belts and had deployed frontal and left side seat mounted and head curtain airbags. She was transported by air to a level one trauma center for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash.
