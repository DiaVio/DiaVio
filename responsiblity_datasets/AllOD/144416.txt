Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Mercury Sable, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the right southbound lane of a three-lane, two-way road and was stopped at the intersection with a four-lane, two-way, divided parkway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Buick Regal, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the left westbound lane of this intersecting 4-lane divided road. It was dawn, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surfaces were dry. As V2 approached the intersection from the east, both drivers entered the intersection and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and V2 to rotate counterclockwise such that the left-rear of V1 struck the right-rear of V2 in a side-slap configuration. V1 came to rest in the left westbound lane facing west. After impact, V2 departed the road onto the median and then re-entered the road and came to a controlled stop in the left westbound lane facing west. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 72-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
