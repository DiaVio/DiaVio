The case vehicle, a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe, was traveling south on a snow covered two-lane roadway. It was daylight and snowing. As the case vehicle came over the crest of a hill the vehicle began to fishtail. The driver was not able to regain control and the vehicle departed the roadway in a yaw, off the west shoulder. The case vehicle struck a 31-cm tree with its right side and rotated clockwise approximately 180 degrees before it came to rest on the roadside facing northwest. The 16-year-old restrained female driver, the restrained 13-year-old female right-front passenger and the 10-year-old restrained female right-rear passenger were the only occupants. The driver was taken to a local hospital and treated and released. The right-front passenger and the right-rear passenger were taken to an outside hospital and later transported to a level-one trauma center at a children's hospital.
