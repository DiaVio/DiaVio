This 91-year-old male case occupant was the belted driver of a 2011 Chevrolet Colorado compact pick-up truck, which was primarily involved in two, moderate pole impacts to the frontal and top planes (inclusive of an interrupted pre-rollover movement). The frontal impact had a 12 o'clock prinicipal direction of force, while the top plane impact inolved a non-horizontal force. As a result of the crash, the case occupant's frontal impact air bag deployed. The case occupant was sitting upright in a bucket seat which was found, at inspection, adjusted to the rear seat track position. At the time of the crash, the case occupant was 183 cm (72 inches) in height and weighed 73 kg (160 pounds). During an initial impact to the rear plane of another vehicle, the case occupant moved somewhat forward and slightly left, pre-loading his seat belt restraint with his upper torso. During a subsequent frontal impact (front right) with a pole (yielding), the case occupant was projected mostly forward and a little right in reference to the vehicle. The case occupant likely contacted the deployed frontal air bag and possibly bent the steering wheel rim with his chest/abdomen, though the rim could have been deformed by a subsequent impact-generated intrusion of the left A-pillar. The case occupant is believed to have started to rebound as the case vehicle rotated clockwise while canting to the left. At this time, the case vehicle struck another pole with its front left corner area while rolling left and into the pole, deforming the left front/top plane, the left A-pillar, the left side rail and the roof panel vertically downward (event 3 / non-horizontal impact). It is suspected that the case occupant's head struck/was struck by the intruding B-pillar and left side rail with noted hair deposits and a contact depression to the roof paneling at the side rail. The case occupant came to rest within his respective seating area, though his post crash posture is unknown. The case vehicle likely came to rest in an unstable position due to the impacted poles and their relative locations. The case occupant's injuries include a left intraventricular hemorrhage due to probable contact with the left B-pillar and/or left side rail during the non-horizontal impact to the top plane (event 3). Bilateral scalp abrasions were due to probable contact with the side rail, also associated with the non-horizontal imapct to the top plane (event 3). A right 1st rib fracture was due to an unknown contact source and event, though the seat belt could be considered as a likely involved component. A left shoulder contusion was due to probable interaction with the seat belt webbing and attributed to event 3, though any of the case vehicle involved events may be a source of energy for this injury. The maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for this case occupant was MAIS 2.
