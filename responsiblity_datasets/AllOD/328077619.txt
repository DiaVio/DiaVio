The case involves a 49 year old male (Ht: 188 cm; Wt: 83 kg) driving the case vehicle (2005 Nissan Altima) involved in a crash which in which the car spun in a counterclockwise direction across the road and collided with an embankment on the passenger side of the vehicle (4-5 o'clock direction). The case driver was restrained with lap and shoulder belt. The atlanto-occipital dislocation (cause of death) was attributed to the occupant being restrained at the pelvis and was loading his seat back with his torso, but his head was not restrained in the crash which resulted in hyper-extension of his cervical spine. Fracture of the right obturator ring and the liver laceration were attributed to restraint/contact (confidence = high) due to the lap belt and center console, respectively.
