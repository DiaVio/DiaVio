The case occupant is a 35-year-old, restrained male driver of a 2002 GMC Sonoma pickup truck that was involved in a frontal collision with a utility vehicle. Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 GMC Sonoma pickup truck, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway and was traveling under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2005 Lincoln Navigator utility vehicle, was traveling west on the same roadway. While negotiating a curve, V1 crossed the centerline and the front of V1 struck the front of V2. V1 came to rest facing west on the south portion of the roadway while V2 came to rest facing west on the northern portion of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 35-year-old male and case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and the frontal, steering wheel mounted air bag deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
