Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Mercury Mariner, sport utility vehicle, was traveling north in the northbound lane one of a five-lane, two-way trafficway approaching an traffice controlled intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee was traveling south the southbound left turn lane at the same intersection. It was day time, the weather was clear and the bituminous (asphalt) road was dry and level. The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway is 64 km/h (40 mph). The crash occurred when V2 began making a left turn at the intersection. The frontal plane of V1 then impacted the right side plane of V2. V1 came to final rest in the northwest corner of the intersection. Both vehicles came to final rest facing northeast. The 56-year old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was restrained using the available 3-point lap and shoulder belt and the frontal airbag deployed. The belt pre-tensioner also actuated. He sustained serious injuries to his chest and leg. He was airlifted to nearby level one trauma center.
