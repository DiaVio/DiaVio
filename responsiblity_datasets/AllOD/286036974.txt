Vehicle one (V1-case vehicle), a 2005 Nissan Altima, 4-door sedan was traveling in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. It was dark (no street lights), the weather was clear and the bituminous roadway was dry. As V1 completed a left curve in the roadway, it traveled off the right-side road edge into a wooded area. The front of V1 impacted a small 14-cm tree with the front right corner, and then impacted a 40-cm tree with its front left. After impacting the larger tree with its front bumper, V1 rotated 90 degrees in a clockwise direction before traveling to its final resting position facing east. The 48-year-old female driver (case occupant) of V1 was not using her available three-point seat belt (pretensioner fired in not used position) and the available driver's air bags (front, seatback-mounted thorax, and side curtain) all deployed as a result of the impact with the large tree (event 2). The driver (case occupant) was transported from the scene to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. There were no other occupants in the case vehicle.
