This case involves a restrained 71 year old female driver in a 2011 Toyota Corolla (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side airbags, and dual side curtains. The steering wheel mounted frontal airbag and both side curtains deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on a wet asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway that intersected another roadway to form a "T" shaped intersection. The two lanes of the east and westbound asphalt roadway were also wet due to it raining during the crash. The southbound was curved to the right and had a downhill slope. It was controlled by a stop sign. The east and westbound lanes of the intersection were flat, straight, and not controlled by any traffic signals or signs. The posted speed limit for the southbound lane was 45 kph (72 mph). V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane while negotiating a right curve. The driver of V1 noticed a stop sign as she approached the intersection. The driver of V1 applied her brakes in an attempt to stop; however, V1 began to slide on the roadway. V1 slid across the intersection crossing both lanes of the intersecting roadway and departed the roadway into a ditch. While on the roadside, V1 contacted a ditch with its front. After impact with the ditch V1 continued a short distance forward and contacted a tree with its front right corner. This impact caused V1 to rebound while rotating clockwise. It then contacted the ditch with its rear. V1 came to rest facing north after the final impact with the ditch. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The restrained driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital following the crash. She was later transported to a level one trauma center where she received additional treatment for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
