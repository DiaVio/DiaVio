This moderate severity head-on crash occurred on a two lane, two way roadway with paved shoulders during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Ford Escape compact utility vehicle was travelling in the westbound lane going straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 1979 Toyota pickup truck was travelling in the opposite direction in the eastbound lane. V2 crossed the center line and into the westbound lane and partially on the paved northbound shoulder before it began to angle back to the right to return to the eastbound lane. V1 then began to brake and swerve to avoid V2 and the front of V1 impacted head on with the front of V2. V1 was rotated counterclockwise at the point of impact and came to final rest facing mainly south in the eastbound lane. V2 rotated clockwise to final rest and came to final rest facing southeast partially in the eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Case vehicle one had four occupants, with the case occupant being a 68 year old female passenger, seated in the second row left position. She was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt and sustained serious injuries. She was initially transported to a local hospital and then airlifted to the trauma center where she was hospitalized. The other occupants in V1 were a 71 year old male driver, a 95 year old male in the front right position, and an 89 year old female in the second row right position. They were also all restrained with manual lap/shoulder belts and frontal airbags deployed for the front occupants. These other occupants all sustained moderate and severe injuries and were taken to a local hospital.
