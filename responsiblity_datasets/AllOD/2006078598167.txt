This two vehicle crash occurred in a traffic tri-color signal controlled intersection with pedestrian signals. There are four eastbound lanes and a raised concrete/brick median separates those lanes from four westbound lanes. The roadway was dry, is straight, level, and of bituminous construction, and has a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). At the time of the crash, skies were clear, and there were no sight restrictions or road defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a white 1992 Honda Accord 4 door was eastbound, in the number two lane, behind a witness in a non-contact pickup truck. The traffic signal was green, then turned to yellow and as the pickup slowed to a stop, the V1 driver, a 20 year old female, passed the pickup on the left and entered the intersection in the number three lane as the traffic signal turned red. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.

Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford Ranger pickup, had been stopped in the intersection waiting to make a left turn. The V2 driver, a 67 year old male, noticed the non-contact pickup stop as the light turned yellow and saw V1 pass this non-contact vehicle on it's left. The V2 driver accelerated to clear the intersection and the front of V1 and right side of V2 collided. V1 driver stated that she was traveling about 48 kmph (30 mph) and the V2 driver stated that he had accelerated to about 24 kmph (15 mph). After impact V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest near the point of impact facing generally southeast. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise and spin to a stop on the crosswalk in the southwest corner of the intersection facing generally northeast.

The V1 driver stated that she and her passenger had just driven from her home about 32 kilometers (20 miles) away and were going to a mall. She added that she was driving about 48 kmph (30 mph) when the light turned yellow, proceeded through the intersection and collided with V2. She advised that she had not made an avoidance maneuver. The V2 driver advised that he had been waiting for 5-10 seconds to make a left turn on a green light, noticed the non-contact vehicle come to a stop when the light changed to yellow, and accelerated to clear the intersection when he noticed V1 pass, and enter the intersection and head toward his vehicle.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to V2 as a driver related factor: false assumption of other's actions. The driver assumed V1 was going to stop when the light turned yellow and proceeded to make the left turn without yielding the right of way to V1.
