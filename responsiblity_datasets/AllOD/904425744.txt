This frontal crash case involves a 77 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with deployed frontal and knee air bags who sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Toyota Camry four door sedan, was southbound in lane one of a two lane, two way asphalt roadway with no curbs present on either side. In V1's precrash area the southbound lane curves to the left with a level grade. V1 was traveling south and as it entered the curve, it departed the roadway to the right. V1's front right struck a small post, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued southbound while traveling further off the roadway and its front impacted a cluster of small diameter maple vine trees, also resulting in minor damage. V1 continued further south and the front of V1 impacted a large tree, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the driver's frontal and knee air bags. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and its undercarriage impacted a small tree, resulting in minor damage. V1 came to final rest completely off the roadway, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 77 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag and lower left instrument panel mounted knee air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
