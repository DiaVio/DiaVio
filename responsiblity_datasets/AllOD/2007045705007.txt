The crash occurred on a residential road in a semi rural area. The road ran east/west and had two narrow lanes (2.4m eastbound and 2.7m westbound) that were divided by a double yellow stripe. The road was straight. In the area of the crash on the westbound approach there was a positive 10.2 percent grade at 35 meters pre-crash and the hill peak (was level) at 24 meters pre-crash. Also a third grade measurement of negative 6.2 percent was taken at 12 meters pre-crash with the actual impact area as level. A private drive intersected the road from the north about 20 meters west of the hill's crest. There were tall bushes and a privacy fence blocking the eastward view of the road from the driveway. On the west edge of the driveway was a utility pole with a convex mirror attached to assist drivers in getting out of the driveway safely. The mirror afforded a view all the way east to the hill's peak from the driveway. The speed limit on the road was 48kmph/30mph. Conditions at the time were daylight with clouds and dry early in the afternoon on a weekday.

V1 was a 1990 Nissan 240SX 2-door, traveling west on the road when its driver locked the brakes at 10.5 meters west of the hill crest and slid into V2, a 1998 Ford Taurus sedan, with its front, contacting V2's right side. V2 had been backing out of the driveway at the time of the crash. Both vehicles came to rest at impact. V1 was driven away after some prying with a pry bar released the left front wheel to move again. V2 was towed away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 was driven by a forty-three year old belted male who was uninjured in the crash. He was on his way home from the grocery store at the time. His on-scene statement to the researcher indicated that he was going "40-45 mph" but in his later interview follow-up he stated that he was "only doing 30mph."

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was other vehicle encroachment from driveway across path. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include a bad knee that makes it difficult for D1 to brake hard, excess speed, work related stress, a tire deficiency due to low tread, the roadway grade, and a sight restriction caused by the shrubbery on the north side of the roadway.

V2 was driven by a twenty-four year old belted female who was uninjured in the crash. Her right front passenger (also interviewee for V2) was coded by police as sustaining possible injuries but refusing treatment. He (passenger) stated that he was telling the driver as they were backing out that he would rather she turn around and head straight out but she told him to mind his own business.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was this vehicle traveling - backing out of driveway. The Critical Reason was coded as an "other" decision error, backed out of driveway with obstructed view. Associated factors coded to the driver include a failure to look, as he (passenger) said she did not use convex mirror located on scene as backup surveillance. The driver also chose an inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive maneuver by attempting to put V2 in drive while still traveling backward. It was also this drivers' first time on the roadway. Other associated factors include the grade of the roadway and a sightline restriction caused by the shrubbery on the north side of the roadway.
