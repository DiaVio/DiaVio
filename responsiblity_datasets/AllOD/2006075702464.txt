This single-vehicle crash occurred on a jersey barrier-divided, straight roadway. The southbound lanes have a 3.3 percent downhill grade and consist of three through lanes with shoulders on both sides. This roadway was slushy and icy at the time of the crash. The speed limit on this roadway is 105 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Jeep Cherokee, was southbound in lane three. A non-contact vehicle in front of V1 decelerated due to the slushy road conditions. V1 traveled off the left side of the road, sliding longitudinally. The left side of V1 struck the jersey barrier. V1 rotated clockwise, then counterclockwise and the front struck the jersey barrier. V1 continued rotating, reentered the roadway and came to rest off the right side of the road. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a twenty-three-year-old female, was traveling with a thirteen-year-old female, from a ski resort to her home. This driver had been skiing three to four hours each day for four days, but was well rested. She was healthy and comfortable with her vehicle and passenger. This driver stated that she applied the brakes and steered left when traffic began to slow down. She drives this route several times each month.

The pre-event movement for V1 was coded as "going straight." The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in same direction while decelerating." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others - traffic slowing for road conditions." An associated factor was poor directional control.
