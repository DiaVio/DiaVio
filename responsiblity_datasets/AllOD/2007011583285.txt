The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a 2 lane, 2 way, straight, level, bituminous roadway just north of an intersection with a similar east-west roadway controlled by stop signs. The north-south roadway had no traffic controls. At the time of the weekday, early morning crash it was dawn, clear and the roadway was dry. Traffic was moderate to steady. The posted speed limit for the north-south road was 80 kmph (50mph).

V1, a 1988 Range Rover solely occupied by a 53-year-old female, was turning left, northbound, from the eastbound roadway described above. V2, a 2007 Toyota Rav 4 solely occupied by a 48 year old female, was traveling at a steady speed southbound in lane one of the roadway described above. While attempting to complete its turn the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 then rotated clockwise and V2 rotated counterclockwise. The front of V1 contacted the right rear of V2. V1 came to rest in the northbound lane facing east-northeast while V2 came to rest off the east side of the northbound lane facing east. The driver of V2 was injured and transported. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1, who lived on the east-west road and traversed that intersection daily, stated that she stopped at the stop sign and looked both ways. She saw a car to her right but it was still far away. She did not see a car to her left. She pulled out and started turning left then saw V2 at the last second. She swerved right but could not avoid V2.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection". The Critical Reason for the Critical pre-crash event was the recognition error "Inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)". Some contributing factors on the part of V1 may include health, fatigue, work/personal stress or driver-training issues which the driver failed to provide details on in the interview. She only said that she was familiar with the road and was not running late for work.

The driver of V2 stated that she was on her way to work traveling at or below the speed limit and was on time. She saw the other driver pull out and knew they were going to hit. She braked and steered left but could not avoid hitting V1.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was "Other vehicle encroachment from a crossing street, turning into opposite direction". The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. A contributing factor on the part of V2 may have been that it left it's original travel lane to cross over the left lane line. She did not have her headlights on at the time of the crash.
