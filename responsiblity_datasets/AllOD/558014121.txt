The 56-year-old female driver of the 2000 Dodge Durango SUV was wearing the available three-point seatbelt as evidenced by the latch being found in the receiver, the webbing having been cut with a seatbelt cutter and a witness mark on the D-ring and the frontal-impact airbags deployed. The case vehicle is believed to have pitched forward on impact. This pitching motion may have been accentuated as a result of the vehicle traversing a shallow downward sloping embankment. On impact, the case occupant moved forward and slightly to the right in response to the ten-degree principal direction of force of the severe frontal impact.
The loss of consciousness is probably due to contact with the sun-visor as evidenced by make-up transfers and scuff-marks on the visor. The displaced 3rd to 9th posterolateral rib fractures, sternum and bilateral ling contusions with pneumothorax were from a combination of contact with the shoulder belt and the steering-wheel rim and column assembly. The contusion to the right abdomen is probably from contact with the steering-wheel rim. The T-10 vertebral body fracture and L1 to L-5 transverse process fractures and the L-5 right transverse process fracture are probably due to compression from flexion and lateral bending. The comminuted, displaced fracture of the right intertrochanteric femur is probably the result of axial loading due to contact with the knee bolster. The case occupant died 29 days post-crash of respiratory failure.
