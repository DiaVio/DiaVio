This single-vehicle crash occurred on a bridge during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions. The trafficway is divided, straight and level and consists of two lanes in each direction. The speed limit for this roadway is 113 kmph (70 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Lincoln Town Car, was eastbound in lane two. The left rear tire tread partially separated and the driver lost control. V1 rotated clockwise and traveled off the right side of the roadway. The front of V1 struck the bridge rail. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a forty-three-year-old female, was traveling from her home state to another state for a business conference. She had been driving for more than four hours at the time of the crash. She was healthy and well rested. This driver rarely travels this route and was driving her parents' vehicle but she stated that she felt comfortable with it. She stated that she had never experienced a tire blow out and she lost control after the vehicle started vibrating and "it felt like the front end dropped down."

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to: blow out/flat tire (left rear tire - partial tread separation)." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "vehicle related factor; tires/wheels failed." This driver's poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected) was an associated factor in this crash.
