Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Ford Focus, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 became disoriented due to a medical condition and relinquished control of the vehicle. V1 departed the right side of the road, began a counter clockwise yaw while attempting to return to the road, and struck a low driveway berm with the right-front wheel. This impact induced a right-side leading rollover. V1 continued in a northerly direction on the east side of the road, rolling with the right side leading. As the vehicle began to enter into the third quarter turn, the undercarriage struck a tree. This impact caused the case vehicle to rotate 180 degrees around the tree where it separated from the tree, completed it rollover sequence and came to rest on its roof facing east. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 67-year-old female driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the seatback-mounted head and torso air bag deployed. She was extricated and transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries.
