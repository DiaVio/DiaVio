This moderate severity rollover crash involved a 42 year old female who was the front right passenger. She was restrained with the lap/shoulder belt and a seatback airbag deployment. She sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours, with clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Ford Mustang GT, was southbound on a two lane, two way roadway with no shoulders. The west side of the roadway is bordered by a ditch, a barbed wire fence, and then an open level farm field. V1 was passing and overtaking a slower vehicle and entered into the opposite lane at a high rate of speed. As V1 returned to the southbound lane, the driver lost control and began to brake. V1 then started to rotate clockwise about 90 degrees, and departed the road to the right into the ditch. The front end of V1 contacted the barbed wire fence. V1 then just started to tilt left and contacted a utility pole with the left side upper side of V1. V1 then started to rollover to the left. The right side back of V1 contacted the pole again as the pole was falling or split. (pole was replaced at time of inspection). V1 then continued to rollover a total of 12 quarter turns to the left into the farm field and came to final rest on its tires in the field facing west. V1 was towed and disabled. The front right passenger in V1 is the case occupant who is a 42 year old female. She was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the side impact seatback airbag deployed. She sustained severe injuries and was taken to an outside hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. The driver was the only other occupant in the vehicle who was 47 year old male. He was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and reported to have sustained moderate injuries.
