This moderate severity rollover collision involved a 28-year-old male driver who was belted, sustained critical injuries, and was transported to a trauma center. This moderate severity rollover collision occurred at night in a dark area of a divided freeway with two eastbound and two westbound lanes separated by a sloped grassy median. The weather was clear and the surface conditions were dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Subaru Legacy four door sedan, was travelling in westbound lane two and the roadway began to curve to the right. V1 departed the roadway to the left into the downward sloped grassy median. Due to the grade, V1 rolled over to its left side and continued to roll eight quarter turns and came to final rest facing northwest on the northbound shoulder of the eastbound lanes. V1 was disabled and towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who is a 28-year-old male. No other passengers were in the vehicle. He was restrained by the manual lap/shoulder belt. The outboard seatback airbag and the left side roof rail curtain airbag both deployed in his position. He sustained critical injuries, was transported to the trauma center, and hospitalized.
