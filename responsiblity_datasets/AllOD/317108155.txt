This case involved the 39 year old unrestrained female driver of a 2008 Nissan Altima four door sedan (V1). There were two other occupants in V1, a nine year old unrestrained female in the front right seat position and a 3 year old unrestrained male in the second seat left position. The passenger frontal airbag deployed as well as the left and right side seat mounted airbags and both head curtain airbags. There was no steering wheel mounted airbag available for the driver due to a previous deployment at which time the airbag was not reinstalled. In this crash, V1 sustained a frontal impact with a guardrail end and a left side impact with a 2008 Toyota Scion four door sedan (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours on an interstate highway with three northbound lanes and three southbound lanes divided by a guradrail. The asphalt roadway was dry with a negative 2% grade. The highway was straight with an exit ramp to the right.and the posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was traveling north in the right lane at an unknown speed when it drifted to the right into the merge lane. V1 struck a guardrail end at the apex of the merge lane and the highway with its front right bumper corner. V1 rotated approximately 250 degrees clockwise into the center lane. V2 was northbound in the center lane and struck the left side of V1 with its frontal plane. V1 continued in a clockwise rotation and came to rest in the left travel lane. V2 continued forward and stopped facing northeast across the center and right lanes of traffic. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (case subject) was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of her injuries. The front right passenger and the second row left passenger of V1 were both transported and released from a trauma center.
