Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 61-year-old female driver of a 2012 Acura TSX 4-door sedan, which was involved in a frontal, narrow corner impact with the left side plane of a 2006 Honda Odyssey minivan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight) of a spring weekend, on a bituminous, north/south roadway, at the area of an intersection (T-type). Though the crash happened within an intersection area, the intersection did not play a part in the crash. The north/south roadway is straight and mostly level, but prior to and at the intersection (southern leg) the roadway becomes divided (painted median). This painted median at the southern leg accommodates the presence of a left turn lane at the northern leg (composed of one northbound through lane, one southbound through lane and one southbound left turn lane). For either the north or southbound travel directions, there are no traffic controls. The speed limit for the roadway is 30 mph (48 km/h) and at the time of the crash, it was cloudy, but the roadway surface condition was unknown. Vehicle 1, the 2012 Acura TSX 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 61-year-old female driver (case occupant) in the northbound travel lane, approaching the intersection from the south. The driver and sole occupant of Vehicle 1 was not restrained by her 3-point, lap/shoulder belt, but Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat-back mounted side air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 is believed to have intended to pass through the intersection and continue traveling north. Vehicle 2, a 2006 Honda Odyssey minivan, was traveling in the southbound through lane, approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to pass through the intersection and continue traveling southbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 entered the southbound travel lane, at the intersection area, while traveling northbound and struck the left side plane of Vehicle 2 with its front left corner area (event 1). It should be noted that police reported witnesses indicated that Vehicle 1 had been traveling in and out of its travel lane prior to the crash at the intersection. Final rest positions for both vehicles could not be confirmed, though Vehicle 1 may have come to rest north of the intersection, at the east curb edge (unconfirmed). As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to severe injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured and drove Vehicle 2 away from the scene.
