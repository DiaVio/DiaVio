This side impact crash involves a 67-year-old restrained female with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred at a T-intersection of two roadways. One of the roadways was north-south and was two lanes and two ways. The other roadway was east west, was also two lanes and two ways and ends at the intersection. The case vehicle (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe, was traveling east and was approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Ford F150 pickup truck, was traveling south and was approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection and the front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise post impact and came to rest in the southeast portion of the roadway. V2 departed the roadway post-impact and came to rest off the roadway to the southeast of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 67-year-old female case occupant who was restrained by the available three point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case vehicle also contained three non-case occupant passengers. In the right front seat there was a 29-year-old female who was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and had the frontal air bag deploy. In the middle seat in the second row, there was a 9-month-old male in a rear facing child safety seat. In the second row right seat there was a 10-year-old female who was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
