This case occupant is a 36 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a frontal air bag deployment. He was involved in a severe frontal crash and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in the southbound travel lanes of a five lane, one way interstate freeway. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes. In the area where the crash occurred, the concrete lanes are straight with a slight uphill grade. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 large pickup with an extended cab, was southbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Freightliner conventional medium/heavy tractor pulling a trailer, was ahead of V1 and was stopped for traffic in lane three. As V1 approached V2's location, the driver noticed traffic ahead of him was slowing, so V1 began to change lanes to the left, moving into lane three. Then the front of V1 impacted the back of V2's trailer, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bag. V1 came to final rest in lane three, still facing south. V2 did not move from the impact and was still facing south at final rest. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 36 year old male, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center where he was hospitalized. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
