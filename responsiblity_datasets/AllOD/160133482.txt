Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Hyundai Accent sedan, was traveling south in lane two of a five lane, undivided roadway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Ford F-150 pickup, was traveling north in lane one of the same roadway. Vehicle three (V3), a 2001 Honda Accord sedan, was traveling north in lane one directly in front of V2. V3 started to decelerate to make a right turn and the front of V2 contacted the back of V3. V3 then came to final rest in lane one of the roadway. After contacting V3, V2 lost control, crossing over three lanes of traffic and entering the southbound lanes where it struck V1 head-on. V1 and V2 came to an immediate final rest after this impact. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 25-year-old female and case study occupant, was properly wearing her three point lap and shoulder belt and had her frontal airbag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
