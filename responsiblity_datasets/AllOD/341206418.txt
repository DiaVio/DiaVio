The rear end crash case involves a 57 year old restrained female with deployed air bags who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during the night time hours (dark but lighted) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a four lane bituminous roadway at a T-intersection which is controlled by a traffic control device. The roadway is level and is seperated by a median strip without positive barrier. The case vehicle (V1) a 2005 Dodge Caravan was traveling northbound in the outer through lane and vehicle two (2) a 2003 Thomas School bus was stopped at a red light just ahead of V1 in the same northbound outer through lane. The crash occurred as V1 approached the T-intersection and impacted the back of V2 who was stopped at a red light resulting in a rear end crash configuration. The driver of V1 was braking at the time of the crash which produced a underriding damage pattern to the front. This was V1 and V2's final resting position facing northbound in the northbound through lane.. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene with light damage. V1 was driven by the 57 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (buckle pretensioner did fire). The available steering wheel mounted air bag and the knee bolster air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by way of helicopter.
