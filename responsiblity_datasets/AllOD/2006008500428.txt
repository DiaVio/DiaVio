The driver reached to pick up his phone and the vehicle drifted off of the right side of the road. Upon departing the roadway V1 continued up an embankment striking a total of five trees. The first three trees did minor damage to the vehicle, mostly causing scratches from overhanging branches. The last two trees caused severe damage to the vehicle.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was "driver related factor, internal distraction." Had the driver not been reaching for his cell phone, he would have been able to remain on the roadway. There are several other factors in this case. The driver owns his own business and is working at all hours, which can lead to fatigue and a lot of work related stress. He did state that he has become used to this kind of working and is not that affected by it. The driver also stated that when he saw the trees coming at him he either closed his eyes or passed out. This gave him no opportunity to try to avoid the impacts. He did state that he applied his brakes hard, but there was no scene evidence to back this up.
