This frontal crash involves a 40 year old restrained male with a deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred at an intersection during the nighttime hours (dark but lighted) with wet and rainy conditions. The collision occurred on a six lane level bituminous roadway with four northbound lanes (two straight lanes with one left turn only lane and one right turn only lane) divided by a double yellow line and two southbound lanes (at south side of intersection). On the north side of the intersection, there are three level bituminous northbound lanes (two straight lanes with one acceleration lane) divided by a double yellow line (not raised) with four northbound lanes (two straight lanes with one left turn only lane and one right turn only lane). The intersection is controlled by traffic control devices in all four directions. The case vehicle (V1) a 2006 four-door Toyota Corolla was being driven northbound in the left straight lane and vehicle two (V2) a 1999 four-door Mercedes Benz C320 was traveling southbound in the left turn only lane. The crash occurred when V2, for unknown reasons, attempted a left turn directly into the path of our case vehicle resulting in an off-set frontal crash configuration for our case vehicle. After initial impact both vehicles rotated counter clockwise approximately 45 degrees before traveling to their final rest positions in the middle of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by the 40 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt and on impact the belt pretensioner (retractor type) actuated. The steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The case occupant was injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance. There were no other occupants in the vehicle at the time of the crash.
