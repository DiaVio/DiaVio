Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Saturn SL sedan, was traveling west in lane two of a three lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2003 Dodge Durango, was traveling north in lane two of a four lane roadway approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection and the front of V2 contacted the left of V1. V2 came to rest in the roadway and V1 came to rest in the grass off of the northeast corner of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant in V1, a 23-year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal air bags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
