This case involves a 63-year-old female driver who was 165 centimeters (5'5") tall and weighing 86 kilograms (190 pounds). The case occupant was driving a 2004 Honda CRV sport utility that sustained a side impact from a 2005 Mack CV700 tandem dump truck on the driver's side. The principal direction of force was 9 o'clock. The case occupant was restrained with a 3-point seat belt with a buckle pretensioner that did not actuate. The Honda CRV was equipped only with a frontal air bag, which did not deploy as a result of the crash. According to witnesses, the case occupant was handing an object to a rear seat passenger and was turned inboard in her seat. She moved outboard and towards the impacting vehicle as result of the collision. The case occupant sustained bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages, cerebral edema, and a brain herniation as a result of hitting her head. The probable point of contact was the front grill of V2 or possibly the left B-pillar. There was no transfer or contact seen on the truck grill. She also sustained a splenic laceration, large and small bowel contusions, and an omentum contusion which was considered to be due to probable contact with the rear lower quadrant of the door panel or possibly the left B-pillar. She had bilateral hand abrasions due to an unknown source. The occupant died due to her injuries less than 46 hours after arriving to the trauma center.
