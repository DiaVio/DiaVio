The 168 cm (5'6"), 54 kg (120 lbs) 15-year-old female right-front passenger of the 2009 four-door Mitsubishi Lancer was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. During the impact with the utility pole she moved forward and outboard relative to the vehicle interior and is presumed to have been flexed forward during the primary impact with the tree. The fractures of the right parietal and temporal bones (vault skull fracture), the basilar skull fracture, the transection of the brainstem and the right clavicle fracture are due to contact with the roof. The abrasion to the bridge of nose, the laceration to the right ear, the bilateral cheek abrasions, the abrasion to the base of the chin, the abrasions to the lateral aspects of the left and right torso the abrasion to the right elbow abrasion and the abrasion to the dorsal aspect of the right hand are from contact with an unknown source. The right shin contusion is probably due to contact with the knee bolster.
