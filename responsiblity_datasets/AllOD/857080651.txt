This 17 year old male case occupant was the driver of 2004 Pontiac GTO 2-door coupe, which was primarily involved in a severe, 03 o'clock right side (far side) impact with a utility pole. He was 180 cm (71 in) tall and weighed 90 kg (198 lbs) at the time. The case occupant was seated in a manually adjusted, bucket seat (with folding back) which was found, at inspection, positioned in the rearmost seat track position. His seat back was upright. There was some deformation present, but with no overall forward or rearward movement of the seat back. The seat belt buckle stalk was found retracted (pretensioner actuated) and the seat belt was found in an extended position. His overall seating area was unremarkable, except for blood stains in and about the seat and steering wheel. No intrusions were present. At impact, the 17 year old driver was projected laterally right, in reference to the vehicle, as the vehicle struck the pole and rotated clockwise. His upper torso and head likely flexed right, into and over the seat back side bolsters. It is believed that he may have struck the front right occupant during some phase of the impact(s) and subsequent rotation to rest. At rest, he was found in his respective seating position. The driver's injuries include: an intra-cerebral hemorrhage, a sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, a basilar skull fracture, facial abrasions, bilateral rib fractures, bilateral clavicle fractures, bilateral lung lacerations and a knee contusion. The source(s) for all these injuries are not known. The injuries are based upon the medical examiner's report and no further descriptors were provided. Any speculation of the source and mechanism would be erroneous, especially given the violent rotation of the vehicle during the crash. The case occupant also received a transected aorta, a liver laceration and an abdominal contusion. The source of the liver laceration and the abdominal contusion are probably loading to the seat belt webbing.
