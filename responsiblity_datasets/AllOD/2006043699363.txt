This crash occurred in the evening of a weekday on a curved suburban roadway. The two-lane north/south roadway was under construction at the time of the crash. A new lane was being constructed adjacent to northbound lane. The bituminous roadway featured a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) and a 1% downhill grade (northbound). Conditions were dark, but lighted with dry pavement and clear skies. The traffic flow was normal at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Land Rover Discovery sport utility was negotiating the curve as it traveled north. As V1 continued along the left curve, the right rear wheel dropped off the shoulder. The driver then steered left to reenter the roadway, and subsequently lost control of the vehicle. She traveled across lane one into the oncoming lane of travel and then rolled over one quarter turn onto her left side. V1 came to rest in the middle of the roadway on its left side. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 22-year old female, was transported with minor injuries. She stated that she was looking down in the passenger toe pan as she negotiated the curve. When she looked up she quickly steered left, causing the vehicle to rotate counter-clockwise and swinging the tail end partially off the roadway. As she re-entered the roadway, she was heading right for a telephone pole, so she jerked the wheel sharply right to avoid impact. This action caused the vehicle to roll over. V2 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason was a driver related factor of internal distraction. Associated factors coded to this vehicle include traveling too fast for conditions, the presence of alcohol in the driver, as well as the roadway being under construction.
