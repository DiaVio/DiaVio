This case involves a 2007 Nissan Altima four door sedan. The driver and only occupant of the vehicle is a 39 year old male. The crash occurred at night on a lighted interstate roadway. The dry asphalt road was straight and level with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes divided by a grass median. The case vehicle was traveling in the left southbound lane when the driver steered off the left edge of the pavement and traveled 143 meters before crossing the southbound lanes and going off the right shoulder of the roadway. V1 went airborne over a drainage ditch and landed at nearly a 45 degree angle on its left side/undercarriage approximately 4 meters below the road level. V1 slid about 3 meters to final rest still on its wheels. The case subject was restrained by the 3-point manual lap and shoulder belts. The left seat mounted airbag deployed and the left roof side rail curtain airbag also deployed. The frontal airbags did not deploy in the crash. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage and the driver was transported by air to a trauma center due to incapacitating injuries.
