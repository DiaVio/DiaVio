Vehicle two (V2) a 2003 Freightliner Columbia tractor-trailer was eastbound on the intersecting road approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was crossing through the intersection the front end struck the right side of the tractor portion of V2. The case vehicle then rotated clockwise and with its left side under-rode and stuck the right side of the trailer portion of V2 . The case vehicle came to rest facing east in the intersection. V2 came to a controlled stop east of the intersection. 69 year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. None of the available side impact airbags deployed.
