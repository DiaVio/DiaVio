The case occupant is a 21 year old female driver in a head-on frontal collision who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with frontal and side curtain air bag deployments and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during evening hours with cloudy but dry conditions in the northbound lanes of a divided interstate freeway. For northbound vehicles, there are three general purpose lanes and one high occupancy vehicle/carpool lane. Just west of the carpool lane is a jersey barrier that separates the north and southbound freeway lanes. On the east side there is a concrete shoulder followed by a wall with a jersey barrier at its base. In the area where the crash occurred, the lanes are comprised of concrete, are straight and level and were illuminated by street lights. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Ford Escape four door utility vehicle, was northbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Honda Civic four door sedan was southbound in the northbound lanes, traveling in lane three, opposite V1. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2. Post impact V1 rotated counterclockwise about 270 degrees across lanes one and two and the paved east shoulder before the front right of V1 impacted the jersey barrier. V1 came to final rest on the east shoulder facing east. Post impact V2 was forced backwards by V1 into the adjacent carpool lane where it came to final rest near the jersey barrier, facing southeast. Both vehicles were severely damaged and were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant, a 21 year old female, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed along with the left and right side roof rail curtain air bags. This case driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
