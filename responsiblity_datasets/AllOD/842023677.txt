This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 8 year old female front right passenger, and unrestrained 6 year old female rear right passenger, of a 2000 Dodge Dakota SLT Quad-Cab 4x4 pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree. Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver initially allowed the vehicle to partially depart the right (south) pavement edge, as driver input re-directed the vehicle back across the roadway and towards the left (north) pavement edge. Vehicle 1 traversed the westbound travel lane and entered a private yard where the front left area subsequently impacted a large diameter tree. The impact resulted in moderate damage. Vehicle 1 rotated (slightly) counterclockwise and came to rest against the struck tree facing northeast. The restrained 8 year old female front right passenger of the 2000 Dodge Dakota pickup (case occupant 1) was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-rear track position. Restraint usage was evidenced by the loading marks and fabric transfers identified on the front right 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At impact, the front right child passenger initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual restraint and deployed front right passenger airbag. Interaction with the deployed front right passenger airbag was evidenced by the pronounced red/black fabric transfer documented on the face of the membrane. The unrestrained 6 year old female rear right passenger of the 2000 Dodge Dakota pickup (case occupant 2) was seated in an upright posture within a high-back booster child safety seat. The combination forward-facing (with 5 pt. integral harness) and high-back (belt positioning) booster safety seat was tethered (incorrectly) to the rear left anchor post; and not secured to the vehicle seat by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. The lack of vehicle restraint use was evidenced by the extensive forward excursion of the booster seat, relative to the concentration of contacts identified on forward components. At impact, the rear right child passenger (and booster child safety seat) initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the front right seatback. This trajectory was evidenced by the pronounced indentation documented on the lower seatback (which matched the contour of the booster seat), and scuff marks adjacent to the contact site. The contact pattern continued vertically upward to the head restraint. In addition, rear right child passenger loading of the front right seatback deformed this component from a slightly reclined to an upright position. Following the crash, all three occupants (to include the unrestrained 34 year old male driver) of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and admitted for treatment. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
