This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 76 year old female driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Venture minivan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2000 Chevrolet C-1500 4x4 pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was traveling in a northeasterly direction on a two lane rural roadway, and negotiating a left curve on approach to a 3-leg "Y" intersection. Vehicle 2 was traveling in a southwesterly direction on the same roadway, and negotiating a right curve. It was daylight, with rainy weather conditions as the roads were wet. Vehicle 2 attempted to turn left (south) onto the intersecting roadway, across the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 crossed the northbound lane, the front right area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage. Following impact, both vehicles were redirected into the northeast sector of the intersection. Vehicle 1 came to rest facing northeast as Vehicle 2 came to rest facing southeast. The restrained 76 year old female driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Venture was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat track adjusted to a mid-to-forward position. Restraint usage was confirmed by the extensive loading evidence documented on the driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. It should also be noted that a metal binder clip was found affixed to the driver shoulder belt webbing, and presumed to be used as some type of belt positioning device. At impact with Vehicle 2, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual restraint, knee bolster, and deployed driver frontal airbag. Scuff marks were identified on the left knee bolster. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal airbag was evidenced by the makeup transfers documented on the face of the membrane. At this point, the left lower extremity loaded the parking brake as evidenced by the deformation and skin tissue identified on this component. The right lower extremity loaded the brake and accelerator, evidenced by the lateral displacement of the floor pedals and adjacent fracture of the center console panel. During the vehicle's post-impact trajectory to final rest, the occupant kinematic was redirected to the left as the driver struck the left front door interior surface. A scuff mark and pronounced red fabric transfer were noted on the armrest. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and admitted for treatment. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
