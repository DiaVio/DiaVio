This two vehicle nighttime collision occurred just before mid-night. The collision occurred in a controlled intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The pre-crash roadway southbound is straight and level bituminous paving. The westbound roadway is straight, paved with bituminous, and has a positive grade of 10%. There is a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) for both roads. At the time of the crash, it was raining and the roads were wet, but there was no standing water.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Ranger pick-up, driven by a 30 year-old male was traveling south on the roadway in lane 1. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Honda Accord sedan, driven by a 34 year-old male was traveling west in lane 2. Both vehicles approached the intersection at roughly the same time, V1 failed to stop for the red traffic signal and the front of V1 collided with the right side of V2, causing V1 to deflect to the right and come to rest facing southeast. V2 was deflected southwest, but continued over the southwest curb, up a mild embankment, and came to rest in the parking lot of a business. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V2 was transported to the hospital for treatment of injuries. The driver of V1 was arrested for DUI. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver stated that he was feeling fatigued when he started to drive for this trip home from a friend's house.
