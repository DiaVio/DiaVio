This 70-year-old female case occupant was the right front seat passenger of a 1999 Honda Accord that was involved in a severe frontal collision with a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. The case occupant did not utilize the available 3-point lap and shoulder belt. The available passenger front air bag deployed upon impact. Being unrestrained the case occupant moved forward and struck the deployed airbag causing the lateral bilateral rib fractures and sternal fracture. Her right hand struck the right instrument panel, evident by a crack in the vent, causing the contusion. Her left hand struck the center instrument panel, evident by a scuff mark, causing the metacarpal fracture. It is possible that the case occupant was slightly turned to the right when her left knee struck the glove compartment, loading the femur in a lateral direction resulting in the acetabulum and pubic rami fractures. Her right knee also struck the glove compartment resulting it the contusion to her right knee. The source of the pelvic sidewall hematoma could not be determined with any degree of certainty and remains unknown.
