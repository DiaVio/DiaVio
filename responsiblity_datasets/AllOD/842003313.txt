This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 20 year old male driver of a 2006 Hyundai Accent 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an oblique angle impact with a 1989 Buick Regal Limited 2-door coupe (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side impact air bags for the front seating positions, and side curtain airbags for the outboard seating positions. The right side impact airbag and right side curtain airbag deployed as a result of the crash. Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a right curve. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the same roadway and negotiating a left curve. The driver allowed Vehicle 1 to depart the right (north) pavement edge, as subsequent steering input re-directed the vehicle back across the travel lanes, and across the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 crossed the eastbound lane, the right side surface was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2 resulting in severe damage. Upon impact, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and departed the south pavement edge where it came to rest in a private yard facing northwest. Vehicle 2 rotated clockwise and came to rest across the travel lanes facing southeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The front right passenger of Vehicle 1 expired prior to arrival at a medical facility. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
