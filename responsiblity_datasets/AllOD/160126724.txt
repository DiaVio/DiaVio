Vehicle One (V1), a 2005 Chevrolet Impala sedan, was traveling north in lane two of a five lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle Two (V2), a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, was traveling south in lane four of the same roadway. Vehicle Three (V3), a Motorcoach medium/heavy bus, was traveling north in lane one behind V1. For unknown reasons, V2 crossed the center line and entered the northbound lanes, where the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to a final rest. The impact with V2 rotated V1 to the counterclockwise where its right side contacted the left side of V3. After this impact V1 and V3 came to final rest. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage and V3 was not towed. The case study occupant was the driver of V1, a 45-year-old female. There was also a 53-year-old male passenger sitting in the right front seat. Both occupants were properly wearing thier three point lap and shoulder belts and the vehicle had both frontal air bags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
