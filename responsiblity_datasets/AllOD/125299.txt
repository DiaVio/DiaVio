Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a four-lane, divided freeway (two lanes westbound, portected median, two lanes eastbound). For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 lost control and entered a clockwise yaw. V1 crossed the right eastbound lane and departed the right side of the road. V1 began a four-quarter turn, left-side leading roll when the left tires dug into the sod and were de-beaded from the rim. V1 rolled four quarter turns and came to rest on its wheels facing in a south-southeast direction. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 17-year-old female driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was not injured and did not seek medical attention. The 53-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. The 42-year-old female right-rear passenger (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt. She sustained multiple rib fractures (ISS-10). Both the right-front and right-rear passengers were transported from the scene to a local hospital via ground ambulance and the right-front passenger (case occupant) later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
