The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of an east/west barrier divided urban interstate. It had three lanes, shoulders and emergency lanes in each direction divided by a concrete barrier wall. The area is inside an interchange and impact was just before the gore where an entrance ramp lane makes the interstate four lanes westbound. The interstate curves slightly to the left (south) for westbound travelers with a radius of curvature of 803m and a superelevation of 4%. Conditions were daylight and wet on a weekday afternoon with heavy rain falling. The posted speed limit was 55mph (89kmph).

Vehicle #1 was a 2003 Pontiac Vibe traveling westbound in the far left lane. As the vehicle negotiated the curve left the driver lost control on the wet roadway. It began to slide towards the right and the driver steered left in an attempt to avoid striking a tractor-trailer that was just ahead in the center lane. The driver overcorrected and crossed the emergency lane and struck the concrete barrier wall with its front left corner. A secondary collision followed with the left back of the vehicle contacting the wall. The vehicle came to rest on the right (north) shoulder several meters west of impact. It was towed due to damage.
