This case involves a 49 year old unrestrained male driver of a 2004 Toyota Tundra 4 x 2 double cab four-door pickup truck. The driver was the only occupant in the vehicle. The crash occurred in the evening on a two-lane rural roadway that was lit with street lamps. It was snowing at the time of the crash and the asphalt pavement was slushy with ice and snow. The posted speed limit was 64 kph (40 mph). V1 was traveling west in the westbound lane of the straight and level roadway. The hazardous driving conditions caused the driver of V1 to lose control of his vehicle. V1 travelled across the center lane line and eastbound travel lane. It then continued off the left side of the roadway. V1 contacted a large tree (48 cm in diameter) with its frontal plane. After impact, V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest at the tree. It was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver was not utilizing the three-point manual belt system, but had a deployed frontal airbag. He was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for injuries sustained in the crash.
