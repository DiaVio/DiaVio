Vehicle one (V1), a 1986 Cadillac Eldorado, was traveling east in the second lane approaching the intersection. Vehicle two V2, a 1997 green Oldsmobile Achieve, was traveling north in the second lane approaching the intersection.

The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to V2 as a driver related factor: inattention (i.e., daydreaming). According to a witness, this driver was talking on the cell phone and not paying full attention to the driving task. The driver had concerns about his employment, but did not admit to talking on the cell phone when interviewed.
