This case involves an impact between a tree and the approximate center of the front end of a passenger car. The case occupant is the unrestrained 29-year-old male driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2011 four-door Chevrolet Malibu was travelling north on a dry, level concrete four-lane divided traffic way with a raised median. The case vehicle drifted across the adjacent bike lane, mounted the curb and struck a tree with its front end. After impact, the case vehicle rebounded off the tree and came to rest facing north. It was dark, but lighted and clear. The driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the available frontal-impact air bag deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
