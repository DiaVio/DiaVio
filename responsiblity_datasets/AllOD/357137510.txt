The 165 cm (5'5"), 61 kg (135 lbs) 58-year-old female driver of the 2010 four-door Ford Fusion was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel, seat-mounted and side-curtain airbags deployed. She was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. Efforts to resuscitate her at the scene of the crash were not successful. During the left, nearside impact she remained stationary relative to the vehicle interior and them inboard as she engaged the intruding left-front door. The left neck contusion and left shoudler abrasion are probably due to contact with the top of the rear upper quadrant of the left-front door. The thrombosis of the common carotid artery, the contusion of the left lung hilum, the the lateral fractures of the left 3rd to 5th and 7th to 9th ribs and the lateral fracture of the right 2nd rib the rupture of the right ventricle and the left diaphragm contusion are due to contact with the rear-upper quadrant of the left-front door. The left pericardium rupture and hemothorax are due to the the rupture of the right ventricle. The abrasion and contusion of the left thigh and the left knee contusion are probably due to contact with the forward- lower quadrant of the left door. The right breast contsuion, right thigh contusion, left medial foot contusion, left lower leg contusion and the right lower leg contusion are from an unknown source.
