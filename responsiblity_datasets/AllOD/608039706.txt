The case vehicle, a 2004 four-door Toyota Matrix was eastbound on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt roadway approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle Two (V2) a 2000 GMC Sierra Truck towing a trailer, vehicle three (V3) a 2006 Nissan Altima and vehicle four (V4) a four-door 2004 Infiniti G35, were traveling westbound on the same roadway. It was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions. As the driver of the case vehicle attempted to merge left into a left-turn bay, the case vehicle crossed the center line and entered the path of the westbound traffic. The front of the case vehicle swiped the left-rear side of a trailer that was attached to V2. The front of the case vehicle then contacted the left side of V3. The driver of V4 attempted to avoid a collision by steering right, but the front of the case vehicle struck the front of the Case Vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise approximately 130 degrees before it came to rest facing west-northwest. V2 rotated clockwise approximately 80 degrees clockwise went over a barrier curb on the north edge of the westbound lane and came to rest facing north. The case vehicle and V4 were towed due to damage. V2 and V3 were driven from the scene. The 53-year-old male driver was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. 53-year-old female right-front passenger was restrained by a three-point belt and the top instrument-panel air bag deployed. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant. The 53-year-old female right-front passenger sustained police reported no injuries.
