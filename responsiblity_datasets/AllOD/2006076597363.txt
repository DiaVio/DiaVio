This single vehicle crash occurred on a two-way two lane rural dirt road with various grades and curves and a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). In the crash area, the road had a downgrade of approximately 6 percent and a curve to the right for westbound traffic and signs warning of the curve and one-lane bridge. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions or road defects present at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Ford Explorer was westbound negotiating the curve and approaching the bridge and began to lose traction. The V1 driver, a 21 year old female, stated that her passenger warned her of her speed and the approaching bridge, and as she applied the brakes, the vehicle began to fishtail and she steered left and right to attempt to control the vehicle and slid into a bridge railing off the left side of the road, climbed up onto the bridge railing and V1 rolled to the right a total of three quarter-turns then came to rest on the driver's side. Both occupants of V1 were transported to a trauma center via air life-flight and released after treatment. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle loss of control due to - traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn. The driver was negotiating the curve on dirt road with 6% downgrade approaching a narrow bridge. The driver estimated her speed as 80 kmph (50 mph) which was too fast on the steep downhill curved roadway approaching the one-lane bridge. Curve and Narrow Bridge warning signs were posted and the driver failed to reduce her speed accordingly. An associative factor is that the V1 driver was conversing with her passenger and apparently only became aware of the approaching bridge when verbally warned by the other occupant.
