This single vehicle crash occurred in a transition zone from a two-lane non-divided roadway to a 4-lane divided roadway. This roadway runs east to west with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). At the point of this change over was a center guardrail that was impacted. This area was part of a left hand curve with a radius of 804 meters (2,637 feet) with an uphill grade of 5% for the eastbound traffic. Warning signs for eastbound traffic approaching the transition area indicate the divided roadway ahead. In the paved gore area a black and white Keep Right sign is located prior to the guardrail. The end of the guardrail is designed to collapse when struck. This crash occurred during the early afternoon with rain and good visibility.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Taurus sedan with two occupants, was eastbound and approaching this divided split when the driver focused his attention on traffic that was exiting the divided roadway coming towards him. When he looked forward V1 was headed into the end of the center guardrail. The front left corner of V1 struck the guardrail and the vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise and the rear plane impacted the guardrail a second time. V1 came to rest in lane one on the divided roadway heading in a northwesterly direction. V1 was towed due to damage. Medical personnel on scene treated the two occupants for minor injuries but were not transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, an 86 year-old male, was returning home from grocery shopping. He drives the route weekly and is familiar with the vehicle. He has a heart rhythm condition and low blood count. Medication consists of Coumadin, Warfarin, Hydrochorothiazide, Folic acid and vitamins. He is retired and had 9 hours of sleep the night before. His wife, the right front passenger has dementia and does not interact. Approaching traffic off of the divided roadway distracted the driver, the vehicle traveled onto the paved gore area where it struck the end of the guardrail.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road, on the left side. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: external distraction.
