This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 67 year old female driver of a 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 4matic 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags, knee bolster air bags, (seat back mounted) side air bags for the driver/front right passenger positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions. The driver frontal air bag and left knee bolster air bag deployed as a result of a frontal collision with a large tree The crash occurred on a multi-lane east/west trafficway, just east of a hillcrest. The east/west asphalt (downhill grade) travel lanes were divided by a (curbed) grassy median with trees located in the middle, spaced every 30 feet (starting at the point of impact). The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 56 km/h (35 mph). It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 1 was eastbound in the inboard through lane when as it exited a right curve the driver lost control (possibly due to a medical emergency) and exited the roadway onto the grassy median. Vehicle #1 traveled approximately 200 feet (the road began to curve back to the left) before impacting a large tree with the direct center of the front bumper. This was vehicle #1â€™s final resting position. The restrained 67 year old female driver of the 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 sedan was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-rearward track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks on the available driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. Following the collision, the restrained driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported from the scene to a nearby hospital and then air lifted to a trauma center and admitted for treatment of her serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site.
