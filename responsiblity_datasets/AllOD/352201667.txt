Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 59-year old, female driver, of a 2002 Jeep Liberty utility vehicle, which was involved in a frontal collision with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight) of fall weekend, on graded and curved, two-lane roadway. This rural east/west roadway has a right turning curve for the eastbound travel direction, at the area of a hill. Beyond this curved hill area, the roadway becomes straight with a downhill grade. At the south roadside edge, there is an embankment with a negative grade and multiple trees. The east/west roadway has a speed limit of 35 mph (56 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2002 Jeep Liberty utility vehicle, was being operated by 59-year old female driver (case occupant) in the eastbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was noted to be utilizing her 3-point lap/shoulder belt (with retractor pretensioner) and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with redesigned frontal air bags. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the right turning curve, it drifted into the westbound travel lane at the area of the hillcrest. The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to regain the eastbound travel lane, but oversteered right while braking. Vehicle 1 departed the south roadside edge where it struck a tree with its frontal plane. Vehicle 1 came to rest at the tree, facing a unknown direction. Due to the impact with the tree, Vehicle 1's frontal air bags deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
