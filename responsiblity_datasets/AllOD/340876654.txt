This case involves a passenger car, which was struck on its left side by the front of a 4x4 SUV. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle a 2010, four-door, Honda Accord was westbound on a dry, level, concrete, three-lane roadway approaching a private drive for a strip mall. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005, 4x4 Hummer H2 SUV was westbound in the same lane overtaking the case vehicle. As the case vehicle was making a left turn across the two eastbound lanes to enter the driveway, V2 crossed the center-line attempting to pass the case vehicle on the left. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle engaging the A-,B- and C-pillars. As a consequence, the case vehicle was pushed by V2 into the south curb. Both vehicles remained engaged as they rode over the curb. The right fender of the case vehicle struck a sign post and the left-front corner of the bumper fascia scraped a retaining wall before they came to rest, with the case vehicle facing south and V2 facing southwest. It was daylight and clear. The restrained 42-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed seatback-mounted and roof side-rail curtain air bags. There were no indications the deployment path of the seatback-mounted air bag was impinged. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
