The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the 30-year-old female driver was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported to a level-one trauma center and treated and released with minor injuries. The following day she was re-admitted due to complications. She was enrolled as a case occupant prior to the decision to remove her from life support and her subsequent death. The initial non-injury producing impact behind the vehicle's CG produced a clockwise rotation in the vehicle which retained its forward momentum. Consequently, it departed the roadway where it narrowly impacted a pole. This impact resulted in only the sheet metal of the left fender being engaged until the left-front drive wheel was impacted. The narrow corner-impact may have resulted in a crash pulse that the early model air bag sensor did not identify as requiring and air bag deployment until 'late' in the event. The 168-cm (5' 5"), 71 kg (157 lb) 30-year-old female driver was restrained by a three-point restraint, indicated by a witness mark on the D-ring and a deployed steering-wheel air bag. She moved forward in response to the moderate 12 o'clock impact. The 'soft' initial phase of the second impact, probably permitted some spooling out of the shoulder belt before the LF wheel was engaged by the pole. The 3-cm laceration over the right parieto-occipital region and the underlying small subdural hematoma were probably due to contact with the header. The rupture of mucosa of the nose and the contusion to the lower lip are probably due to contact with the deploying steering-wheel air bag. The abrasion to the left neck and the left internal carotid artery dissection with thrombosis and neurological deficit are probably due to contact with the shoulder belt webbing. She died 13 days post-crash.
