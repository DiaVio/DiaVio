The case focuses on a restrained 17 year old female driver in a 2009 Honda Civic 2 door coupe (V1). There was also a 15 year old, restrained, female passenger in the right front passenger seat who is not a case subject. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual side airbags. All airbags deployed with the exception of the right side curtain and right outboard seat-mounted airbag. V2, a 2011 Dodge Ram 5000 pickup was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours at the intersection of two two-way, two-lane, straight roadways that formed a "T" shaped intersection. All lanes were asphalt with positive grades. The speed limit for all travel lanes was 64 kph (40 mph). The southbound lane was controlled by a stop sign. There were no adverse weather conditions. V1 was stopped at a stop sign while in the southbound lane waiting for traffic to clear prior to attempting to make a left turn. V2 was traveling up a hillcrest in the westbound lane approaching the intersection. The driver of V1 did not see V2 approaching from her left and turned left at the intersection in attempt to head eastbound. The driver of V2 noticed V1 entering his lane and steered left while applying his brakes. The front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise while heading southwest off the left roadside. Both vehicles went down an embankment while still in contact. The right side of V1 came in contact with two small trees as it came to a final rest. V1 came to rest on the roadside while facing southeast. V2 came to rest on the roadside while still in contact with V2, facing southwest. The driver was transported to a level one trauma center where she was treated for severe injuries that she sustained in the crash. The right front passenger was also transported to a level one trauma center; however, her treatment and injuries are unknown.
