Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, 4-door pickup truck was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle two (V2), a 2009 Ford Escape, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of the same road and negotiating a right curve. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy and the asphalt road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V2 crossed the centerline and into the path of V1. The driver of V1 was unable to take any avoidance actions and the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset-frontal manner. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 130 degrees and came to rest on the east shoulder of the road facing south-southwest. V1 rotated counterclockwise while departing the west side of the road and V1 tripped over its right wheels and rolled 4-quarter turns coming to rest on its wheels facing east-southeast. Both V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 26-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries. The 60-year-old male right-front passenger was using the avaialable three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and was treated and released with moderate injuries (MAIS-2, ISS - 9). The 33-month-old (2 years, 9 months) male left-rear passenger (case occupant) was using a 5-point harness in a forward-facing child seat that was secured to the vehicle using the lower anchor straps but not the top tether. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and transferred with his father to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries.
