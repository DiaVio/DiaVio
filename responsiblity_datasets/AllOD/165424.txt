Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Ford Freestar, 4-door wagon was traveling west in the left westbound lane of a five-lane, two-way road (two lanes westbound, center turn-lane, two lanes eastbound). Vehicle three (V3), a 2003 Saturn Vue, 4-door wagon was also traveling west in the left westbound lane and was ahead of V1. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of the same road. It was dark, but illuminated, the weather was cloudy, and the asphalt road surface was wet. For an unknown reason, the driver of V2 reportedly lost consciousness and relinquished control of his vehicle. V2 drifted to the left, crossed the center turn-lane and began to enter the left westbound lane. The front of V2 struck the left-rear quarter panel of V3. This impact caused V3 to rapidly rotate in a counterclockwise direction and it tripped over its right side wheels and rolled one-quarter turn. V3 came to rest on its right side facing south-southeast. V2 continued its trajectory and came fully into the left westbound lane and the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in a full-frontal configuration. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest off the north side of the road facing south-southwest. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the cener turn-lane facing north-northwest. All three vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 47-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
