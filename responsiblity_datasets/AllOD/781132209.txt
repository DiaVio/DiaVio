This case involves the belted female driver of a compact passenger car responding to a head-on, off-set left, collision with an SUV. The subject's steering wheel mounted frontal-impact air bag deployed in response to the 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact. The vehicle was 'severely' damaged and the subject sustained serious injuries. This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, east/west trafficway traveling through a rural area. The lanes were separated by painted double yellow lines. The eastbound approach to the crash site was straight with an uphill grade. The westbound approach had a left curve and downhill grade. The roadway was bordered by gravel shoulders and upward embankments on both sides. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the afternoon, weekend crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2007 Toyota Corolla, 4-door sedan) was traveling eastbound. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal-impact air bags. There were four occupants in V1. The 23-year-old female driver (case subject), 47-year-old female front right seat passenger, 15-year-old female left rear seat passenger and the 15-year-old right rear seat passenger were all using their belt restraints. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2000 Mitsubishi Montero, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling westbound, around the left curve and downhill. The driver of V2 allowed the vehicle to travel off of the right roadside during negotiation of the left curve. The driver steered left in an effort to regain the roadway. The steering maneuver resulted in V2 entering a counterclockwise yaw as it re-entered the roadway, continuing into the on-coming lane; and into the path of V1. The driver of V1 (subject) observed V2 as it appeared around the curve, already in a noticeable yaw. The subject was unable to react before impact. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a head-on, offset-left, with V1 in an underride configuration. V1's first row frontal-impact air bags deployed. The impact brought V1 to a halt, re-directing it rearward and to the right (SW), where V1 came to rest against the upward embankment facing east. V2 rotated counterclockwise as it rode up onto the left side of V1, while pushing it rearward. V2 eventually overturned onto its right side as it came to rest facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. All four occupants of the case vehicle, as well as the driver of V2, were transported to trauma facilities due to varying degrees of injury.
