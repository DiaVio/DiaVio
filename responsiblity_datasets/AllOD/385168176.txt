Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 62-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan, which was primarily involved in a left plane impact (near side), by the frontal plane of a 2009 Lexus RX350 utility vehicle. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight), of a fall weekday, near the junction area of a curved, two-lane transition ramp, and a north/south trafficway (interchange area). The transition ramp has a downhill grade and curves to the right. The ramp carries traffic from a westbound roadway to a northbound roadway. The northbound roadway consists of three travel lanes and curves to the left as it enters the merge area with the two-lane ramp. At time of the crash, it was raining and the roadway surfaces were wet. The speed limit for both roadway and ramp was 55 mph 89 km/h). Vehicle 1, a 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan, was being operated in the two-lane transition ramp, by the 62-year old male driver (case occupant). He was not restrained by an available 3-point, lap/shoulder belt, but the vehicle was noted to be equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags only. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the curved section of the ramp and continue traveling north on the northbound roadway. Vehicle 2, a 2009 Lexus RX350 compact utility vehicle, was traveling in the middle, northbound travel lane, approaching the merge area from the south. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling north. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the curved and graded area of the ramp, it departed the roadway (loss of control) to the left and entered the grass and shrub covered left roadside, approaching the northbound roadway, from the right. At this time, Vehicle 1's left front tire struck/traversed an open drainage grate area (event 1 / minor). Vehicle 1 continued to travel west where upon it struck several small trees with its frontal plane (events 2 and 3) before entering the northbound roadway, heading west. As Vehicle 1 crossed the northbound travel lanes, Vehicle 2's frontal plane struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1 (event 4). As a result, Vehicle 1 is suspected of being rotated counterclockwise as it departed the west edge of the northbound roadway. Vehicle 1 entered a ditch area where upon it began to roll (left side leading / event 5) and eventually struck the far embankment bottom of the ditch with its back left corner (event 6) as it rolled. During the rollover, Vehicle 1 struck a small tree with its top plane (hood area / event 7) and eventually contacted the far embankment with its top plane (heavy crush at the back right header area). Vehicle 1 likely slid back into the ditch area, where it came to rest, on its top plane. Subsequent to its impact with Vehicle 1, Vehicle 2 appears to have spun off the west edge of the roadway and also came to rest at or near the ditch area. As a result of this crash, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for Vehicle 1 as did the driver's frontal and knee bolster air bags for Vehicle 2. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was able to exit the vehicle either under his own power or with some assistance. He was transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and was hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
