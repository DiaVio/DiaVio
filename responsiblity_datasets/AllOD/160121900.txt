Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Escape, was traveling north in lane one of a three lane, one way, divided highway under dry, daylight conditions. The driver of V1 and sole occupant, a 53 year old female, swerved left to avoid a vehicle encroaching into its lane, triggering a rollover to the right side. V1 rolled six quarter turns and then hit a metal guardrail on the west side of the roadway with its roof and then came to final rest.

The driver of V1 was wearing a lap and shoulder belt and no airbags deployed. The driver was transported by helicopter to a level one trauma center.
