Vehicle One (V1), a 1997 Ford Explorer 4-door, was traveling north in lane four of a four lane roadway under dry, daylight conditions and approaching an intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2001 Ford F150 super cab, was traveling south in lane two of a four lane roadway approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection and V2 attempted to pass straight through the intersection. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles came to rest on the west side of the intersection in the eastbound lanes. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and sole occupant, a 44 year-old male, was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
