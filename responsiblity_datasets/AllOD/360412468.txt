This case occupant is a 52 year old male driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during evening hours in darkness with overhead street lights, clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford F150 Super cab three door large pickup, was northbound in lane three of a seven lane, two way, asphalt roadway. V1 was approaching a four legged intersection controlled by traffic signals. The precrash roadway is straight and level, and on the west side of the street there is a sidewalk, followed by an area of large boulders surrounding a ditch. The driver of V1 experienced a medical condition/illness, began traveling in a northwesterly direction, and departed the roadway to the left. V1 traveled across the sidewalk and then the front of V1 struck a large boulder, resulting in the deployment of both frontal air bags. V1 was redirected to the left, traveled down into the ditch, and its right side scraped along the boulders, resulting in minor sideswipe-like damage. V1 came to final rest facing southwest, completely off the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 52 year old male, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center, where he was hospitalized. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
