This interrupted rollover collision involved a 29 year old female driver who was restrained with the lap/shoulder belt with a roof side rail curtain airbag deployment. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. This crash occurred on a four lane, one way northbound street during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. The far right curb lane one was dedicated for bus traffic only. Lanes two to four were for vehicles in transport and a far left curb lane was for parking only. Vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Toyota Highlander four door compact utility vehicle was northbound in lane four and travelling straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, was northbound in lane three and slightly ahead of V1 in the adjacent lane. Vehicle three (V3), a 2005 Honda Accord, was not in-transport and parked in the left curb parking lane facing north. V2 began to change lanes to the left and the left side front of V2 impacted the right side front of V1. This impact then caused V1 to rollover to the left leaving tire marks from the left front and rear tires. V1 then landed on its left side into the parking curb lane. V1 slid on its left side and then the front of the roof top and windshield header impacted the back of V3. V1 came to final rest against V3. V2 came to final rest facing mainly north in lane four next to V1. All vehicles involved were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 was the case subject. She is a 29 year old female and was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the roof side rail curtain airbag deployed during the rollover event. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. One other occupant was in V1, a 31 year old male seated in the front right passenger seat. He was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and in his position the right roof side rail curtain airbag deployed during the rollover event. He sustained minor injuries and his treatment status was unknown.
