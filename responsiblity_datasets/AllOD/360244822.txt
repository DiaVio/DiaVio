This case occupant is a 72 year old female driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt who was involved in a single vehicle frontal crash with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane, two way state freeway with no shoulders or curbs present. There are ditches on either side of the roadway, followed by grassy areas with trees. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear with dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Subaru Outback station wagon, was traveling south in lane one when it began to depart the roadway to the right. V1 traveled off the roadway and into the ditch, striking a culvert and asphalt driveway with its lower front bumper. V1 continued up and over the driveway, continued south through the grass, and then V1's front right impacted a tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal impact air bag and actuation of the left front seat belt retractor pretensioner. V1 rotated clockwise and began to rollover with its left side tires leading. V1 rolled two quarter turns to the left and came to final rest on the west side of the roadway, on its roof, facing west. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 72 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the second crash event, the steering column mounted front air bag deployed and the left front seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
