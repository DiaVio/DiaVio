This is a two-vehicle intersection related crash that occurred during the evening rush hour in congested traffic on a two-way three-lane roadway at a driveway access. There is one southbound and one northbound lane and a center turn lane on the primary roadway. This road surface was dry, level asphalt with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The weather was clear and it was daylight.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Honda Accord sedan driven by a 36 year-old female, was exiting a private drive to turn left to head north. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Kia Sportage SUV driven by a 37 year-old female, was traveling southbound in the number one travel lane and then changed lanes into the center turn lane going straight. As V1 attempted a left turn the front of V1 contacted the right side of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest at the point of contact within one meter (3 feet) of each other. V1 was towed from the scene and V2 was not. There were no reported injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 8 kmph for V1 and 8 kmph for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver related factor: other decision error (specified as: turned with obstructed view). The driver stated that due to stopped traffic and being waived on by other driver see thought it was clear to proceed with her left turn, a false assumption.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment, from driveway- turning into opposite direction. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
