The 170-cm, 85 kg (5'7", 188lbs), 32-year-old male driver of the 2007 4-door Saturn Ion was restrained by a three-point belt and had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel air bag. During the severe frontal impact he moved forward and inboard relative to the vehicle interior. The left occipital base skull fracture, the subgaleal hematoma over left mastoid and occipital regions and the bilateral mandible fractures are possibly due to contact with the right instrument panel. The contusions to the cerebellum and associated subarachnoid hemorrhage under laying the fracture site are due to the skull fracture. The contusions to the cerebrum and associated subarachnoid hemorrhage are possibly due to contact with the right instrument panel. The transection of the pontomedullary junction and basilar artery is possiblely due to head contact with the right instrument panel and shoulder contact with the right-front door. The right-upper forehead abrasion, the right eyelid abrasion and the right lateral forearm and elbow abrasions are probably due to contact with the right instrument panel. The left 1st and right 1-3 lateral rib fractures and right lung contusion are due to contact with the right front door. The mesentery hemorrhage is probably due to contact with the belt. The right lateral hip contusion is probably due to contact with the 1st row center console. The right shin abrasion is probably due to contact with the left instrument panel including the knee bolster. The left upper inner thigh abrasion is from an unknown source.
