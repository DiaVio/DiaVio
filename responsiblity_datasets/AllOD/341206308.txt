This frontal crash case invovles a 30 year old restrained male with deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during dusk hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a three-lane (two travel lanes with one on/off lane) bituminous roadway within the limits of an interchange. The roadway at this area of the interchange has a 2 % positive grade measurement and the trafficway is divided by a median strip with positive barrier (raised curb with guardrail). The case vehicle (V1) a 2005 two-door hatchback Toyota Scion was being driven southbound in the right lane. The crash occurred when V1 was traveling in the right lane while entering an interchange area and began to drift into the left lane. V1 tried to steer the vehicle back to the right and lost control traveling off the south roadedge and impacted a sign post and a concrete bridge pillar resulting in a off-set frontal crash configuration. After initial impact V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise (according to a witness, with the backend raising slightly in the air) before coming to a rest resting against the pillar. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by the 30 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag and the knee bolster air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The case occupant was seriously injuried and transported to a local level one trauma center by ground ambulance.
