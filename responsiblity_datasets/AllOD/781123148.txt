This case involves the belted 23-year-old female driver of a passenger car responding to a 10 o'clock principal direction of force, near side impact with the front of a pickup. The subject sustained serious injury as a result. This two-vehicle crash occurred at the intersection of a three-lane, east/west trafficway and a six-lane north/south trafficway. The eastbound approach had a straight, downhill, single lane for travel (in each direction) and a left turn lane. The straight, level, northbound approach had three lanes for northbound travel, two lanes for southbound and a left turn lane. The intersection was controlled by tri-color traffic signals. The weather was clear and the asphalt trafficways dry during the morning (daylight), weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2005 Honda Civic, 4-door sedan) was traveling eastbound intending to turn left. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts. The 23-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as evidenced by its condition. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1994 Chevrolet "pickup" nfs) was traveling northbound in the number-three lane (right). There was a single occupant of V2. V1 entered the intersection, intending to turn left, where it was struck on its left plane (roughly centered in the driver's door area) by the Front of V2. The driver of V2 had observed V1's maneuver and had applied his brakes, leaving locked wheel skid marks up to impact and final rest. The impact deflected V1 to the right (NW) where it came to rest in the north crosswalk facing SW. V2 was deflected to the left (NW) where it came to rest, still in contact with V1, facing NW. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury(s). The driver of V2 was also transported but with a lesser injury rating.
