This frontal crash involves a 38 year old restrained male seated in the front left (Driver) seating position with a deployed steering wheel air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during the early morning hours (dark but lighted) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a level two lane bituminous roadway that slightly curves to the right. There are two westbound lanes with shoulders on both sides and two eastbound lanes (also with shoulders on both sides). The East and West roadways are separated by guardrails and concrete barriers which enclose train tracks. There are no traffic control devices for each direction. The case vehicle (V1), a 2005 four-door Toyota Camry, was being driven westbound in the left lane at the time of the crash. The crash occurred as V1 was traveling westbound in the left lane and the driver for unknown reasons lost control and traveled off the West road edge impacting its front left with a metal guardrail. After initial impact, V1 rebounded off the guardrail, traveling across both westbound lanes and off the right shoulder impacting its front right with a concrete barrier. V1 then rotated clockwise 160 degrees before traveling to its final resting position off the West road edge slightly up an embankment facing East. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 38 year old male case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt. The retractor type pretensioner actuated as a result of the crash. The available side curtain air bag and the seat back mounted air bag did not deploy as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned at the middle position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was injured in the crash and transported by ground ambulance to a level 1 trauma center for treatment of his injuries.
