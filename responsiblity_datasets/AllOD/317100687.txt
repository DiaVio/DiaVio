This case involved a 19 year old restrained male driver of a 2008 Honda Civic four door sedan (V1). There was a 17 year old restrained female passenger in the front right seat of V1. The other vehicle in the crash was a 2002 Mitsubishi Montereo four door sport utility vehicle (V2). The two vehicles were involved in a head-on collision, followed by a side slap. The driver and passenger of V1 were both restrained by the three-point manual safety belts and had deployed frontal and side impact airbags. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a wet two lane rural asphalt roadway. It was raining at the time of the crash. The roadway curved left for V1 and right for V2. Both vehicles were reportedly traveling at the posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was traveling north when it departed the right side of the roadway. The driver steered back to the left and overcorrected, causing V1 to travel across the center line into the path of V2. V2 was going south when V1 encroached into its travel lane and the two vehicles collided in a head-on configuration. As V1 rotated counterclockwise and V2 rotated clockwise, the vehicles side slapped with V1's right side impacting V2's left side. V1 and V2 came to rest off the west side of the roadway and were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver and right front passenger of V1 were transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital. The driver was later transferred to a level one trauma center and hospitalized. The right front passenger was treated and released from the hospital emergency department.
