This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 45-year-old female belted driver with deployed frontal, head, and side airbags (V1). This occupant sustained moderate injuries after head-on collisions with V2 and V3. The crash occurred midmorning under clear skies on a dry road. A 2008 BMW 328i intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling east on a suburban bituminous three-lane, two-way road. The grade for V1 was level. A 2011 Honda Civic intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) and a 2005 Dodge Neon intermediate size sedan (V3) were traveling west on the same road in the opposite direction. The approach for V2 and V3 was 5% downhill. V1 traveled left over the center line into V2's direction of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on (Event 1) in a small overlap configuration. After impact, V1 continued in the oncoming lane and struck V3 head-on (Event 2) in an offset frontal configuration. V1 came to rest in the road near the point of impact. V2 traveled further down the road before skidding to a stop on the south shoulder. V3 rotated counter-clockwise 50 degrees after impact coming to rest partially on top of a guardrail (Event 3) in the north roadside. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 45-year-old female case occupant. She was belted, and the available buckle pretensioner was actuated. The steering wheel hub, outer seatback, and both curtain airbags deployed. She was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of moderate injuries.
