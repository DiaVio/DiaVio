Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chrysler Sebring, 2-door convertible was traveling west in the westbound lane of a tow-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the dirt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 lost control and began a clockwise yaw. V1 departed the right-side of the road and the left door struck a large tree. V1 came to rest against the tree. The 33-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage.
