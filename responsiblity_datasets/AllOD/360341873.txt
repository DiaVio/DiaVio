This near-side impact crash case involves a 33 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with deployed frontal, side impact and side curtain air bags who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours, in a four way intersection controlled by traffic signals. The intersecting streets are both three lane, two way, level asphalt roadways. At the time of the crash it was cloudy with wet roadway conditions. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2012 Cadillac SRX four-door hatchback, was traveling north in lane one and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2012 Kenworth T600 tractor pulling one trailer, was traveling east on the intersecting street. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the actuation of V1's front left seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of V1's frontal, left side impact and both side curtain air bags. V1 rotated clockwise as it moved east and came to final rest facing northwest in lane two of the intersecting street. After the initial impact, V2 continued traveling forward and came to final rest near V1, facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 33 year old female driver of V1 who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's steering column mounted frontal, left seat back outboard mounted side and both roof side rail mounted curtain air bags deployed during the crash. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There was a two month old male passenger in V1, sitting in the second row right seating position. He was secured in an unknown make/model child safety seat and was not injured in the crash.
