At the time of the crash (a Sunday afternoon), it was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions or roadway defects. The speed limit for the roadway is 105 kmph (65 mph). The entrance ramp is a one-way, two-lane, uphill roadway, which curves right. The ramp merges with a two-lane expressway, forming a four-lane expressway.

He was unable to regain control. The critical precrash event for V1 was: Other vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction while decelerating.
