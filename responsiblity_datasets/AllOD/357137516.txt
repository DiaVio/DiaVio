This case involves small over-lap impacts between a SUV and a passenger car. Both vehicles are case vehicles. The driver of the SUV is one case occupant and the driver of the passenger car is the other. The driver of the passenger car was fatally injured. The first case vehicle (V1), a 2010 Toyota Highlander 4x4 SUV was traveling in the eastbound lane of a dry, level asphalt two-lane road. The second case vehicle (V2) a 2012 four-door Chevrolet Malibu was traveling in the westbound lane of the same roadway. It was daylight and clear. For unknown reasons V2 crossed the centerline and entered the path of V1 and appeared to attempt to avoid a collision by steering right. The front-left corner of V2 struck the front-left corner of V1. The impact caused both vehicles to enter a counterclockwise rotation. V1departed the roadway off the south shoulder and rolled one-quarter turn before it came to rest on the roadside facing southeast. V2 departed the roadway off the north shoulder and came to rest in a field also facing southeast. The driver of the SUV (V1) was a 59-year-old male. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel and knee bolster airbags deployed. The driver of the passenger car (V2) was a 55-year-old male. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The drivers were the sole occupants of case vehicles.
