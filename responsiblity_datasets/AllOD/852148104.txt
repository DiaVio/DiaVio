This case occupant is a 42 year old male driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment in a severe rollover collision and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the pre-dawn hours in darkness with icy roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Mustang two door coupe was westbound on an undivided two lane, two way straight asphalt roadway with an uphill grade for V1's direction of travel. There are no curbs or shoulders on either side of the roadway, and adjacent to the travel lanes are sloped embankments leading to drainage ditches. The driver of V1 lost control due to the icy roadway conditions and departed off the right side of the road. V1 traveled down the steep embankment and the front of V1 impacted the bottom of the muddy ditch . As V1 was pitched forward down the embankment it rotated clockwise and V1's left rear impacted the embankment, causing moderate damage. V1 then began to rollover to the left and the top of the right rear quarter panel struck the embankment, causing minor damage before the top of V1's passenger compartment hit the ground with severe crush. V1's left front door swiped the base of a utility pole, resulting in minor damage where it came to final rest on its top facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 42 year old male, was the sole occupant and was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
