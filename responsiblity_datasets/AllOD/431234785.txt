This frontal crash case involves a 29 year old restrained male driver with a deployed air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred in daylight hours in wet and raining weather. The collision occurred on a level two lane bituminous roadway basically straight in origin and without any intersection or traffic control device involvement. There is one Northbound lane and one Southbound lane that is separated by a double yellow line. The case vehicle (V1), a 2008 four-door Ford F150 crew cab (4x4) pick up, was being driven Northbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, crossed over the Southbound lane and traveled off the left side road edge and impacted a mailbox post with its front bumper. V1 continued on approximately 109 feet before impacting a large tree with its front left bumper and then rotating counter clockwise 40 degrees to final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The driver was entrapped in the vehicle (one leg under IP and the other under the driver's seat) and it took the rescue crew approximately 27 minutes to extricate him. V1 was driven by the 29 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (buckle type pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned between middle and rear most position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a local level one trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of his injuries.
