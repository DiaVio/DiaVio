This 19-year old female case occupant was the driver of a 2011 Nissan Versa 4-door hatchback, which was involved in a moderate, 02 o'clock, far side (right) impact with a stone and mortar pillar/lamp post. The case occupant was not restrained by an available 3-point lap/shoulder belt, but the driver's frontal impact air bag deployed as a result of the impact, as did the right front side torso air bag and the right side rail curtain. The case occupant was sitting slightly reclined in a bucket seat, which was found adjusted to the mid-to-forward seat track position. At the time of the crash, the case occupant was 62 in (157 cm) in height and weighed 106 lbs (48 kg). During the impact, the case occupant was projected right and across the first row seating area, with her right knee/upper leg bending the gear shift. Her head contacted the struck object (stone pillar/lamp post), through the deployed right side rail curtain, while her right shoulder, chest and flank engaged the intruded door panel (inferred contacts). Based upon dicing type injuries, it is believed that her right hand contacted the shattered windshield glazing or the shattered side glazing at the right window frame. The case occupant's injuries include: a right subgaleal hematoma, an anterior scalp laceration (right fronto-temporal), an inferior brain stem injury (pons, midbrain), a cerebellum hematoma (posterior, right hemisphere), cerebral contusions (bilateral, fronto-temporal), a right subarachnoid hemorrhage, a left subarachnoid hemorrhage, a vault skull fracture (right fronto-parietal, depressed), a right ear abrasion, a right eyebrow abrasion and a right cheek abrasion, all attributed to probable contact with the struck object (stone pillar) at/through the deployed right side rail curtain. A right chest abrasion, right rib fractures (1st through 10 posteriorly, 4th through 7th laterally), a right kidney laceration, a right liver laceration, a right renal vein transection, a right clavicle fracture, a right shoulder abrasion and contusion were the certain result of contact with the rear upper quadrant of the right front door panel. The case occupant also sustained lacerations of the right hand (probable windshield or right front side glazing), bilateral knee contusions (left knee: instrument panel possible / right knee: gear shift probable) and a left thigh contusion (unknown contact source. The maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for this case occupant was AIS 5.
