This crash was selected under a principal investigator interest and occurred at uncontrolled intersection during daylight hours on a two lane, two-way highway with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox four door utility vehicle was stopped westbound at an uncontrolled intersection to make a left turn waiting for opposite traffic. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Dodge Caravan, was traveling westbound behind V1 when the front of V2 impacted the back of V1. This forced V1 into the opposite lane of travel and the front of V1 then impacted the front of vehicle three (V3), a 1996 Lincoln Town Car sedan that was traveling eastbound. V1 was then rotated 180 degrees after the impact with V3 and came to final rest mainly in the eastbound lane. V3 continued beyond the intersection and came to final rest on the south shoulder. V2 continued westbound beyond the impact with V1 and then departed the roadway to the right and the front right corner of V2 impacted a light pole. V2 then continued beyond the light pole and came to final rest facing west partially back on to the north shoulder. All vehicles involved were towed due to damage. The case subject is the driver of V1 and no other passengers were in this case vehicle. This case driver was a 41 year old female and was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
