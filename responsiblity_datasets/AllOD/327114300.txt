This case involves a passenger car in frontal impact in off-set with the left side of a compact sport utility vehicle (SUV). The restrained 92-year-old male driver is the case occupant. Neither of the available frontal-impact airbags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2007 four-door Buick Lucerne, was northbound in the right-turn lane of an eight-lane divided level, dry concrete traffic-way. Vehicle two (V2), a 2007 Ford Escape was stopped in traffic in the westbound through lanes of a divided six-lane trafficway . It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle entered the portion of the lane comprising a channel the driver lost control of the vehicle. It crossed both eastbound lanes of the intersecting roadway, rode over the barrier curb of a raised median and struck a traffic light standard, which struck the roof of the case vehicle as it fell. The case vehicle then entered the inside westbound lane and hit the left front fender of V2. After impact, the case vehicle rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest against V2 facing north-northeast. The 92-year-old male driver was restrained by a three-point belt, but neither of the available frontal-impact airbags deployed. He was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. The driver sustained multiple moderate injuries, was transported to an outside facility and then transferred to level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
