This frontal crash case involves a 43 year old restrained female driver with a deployed air bag who sustained moderate injuries. . The crash occurred during the early morning hours (dark, with lights) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two lane, one-way off ramp within the confines of an interchange. This off ramp begins as one lane and then splits into two separate lanes (north and south) and is divided by a grassy median with raised curbs. This bituminous roadway has a positive 6 % grade at pre impact and is level at impact. The case vehicle (V1) a 2000 two-door Ford Ranger (super cab) was being driven westbound on an off ramp. The crash occurred when V1 approached a split in the road, it traveled straight and entered a grassy median, traveling down into a culvert and impacting its front with the ground. After initial impact, V1 continued on traveling up and out of the culvert and traveling to its final resting position just prior to exiting the median. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 43 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned between middle and rear most and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. After V1 impacted the curb, the driver may have been slightly out of position (forward and to the right with a little slack in the belt). The case occupant was moderately injured and transported to a local level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of her injuries.
