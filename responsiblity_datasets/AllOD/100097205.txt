This case involved a belted, male driver responding to a left side impact with another passenger car traveling in the same direction. This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a ten-lane, divided, north/south interstate. There were five lanes for travel in each direction divided by a paved median and concrete barrier. The west roadside had concrete barriers for construction purpose lined up close along the outside (number-one) lane edge. The concrete traffic way was straight and level. The weather was clear and the roadway dry during the mid-morning, weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 1999 Toyota RAV, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling southbound in the number-one (right) lane at police reported (estimated) 69 kmph, intending to continue forward. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The 73-year-old, male driver (subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue, 4-door sedan) was traveling southbound in the number-two lane at a police reported (estimated) 85 kmph, intending to continue forward and gaining on V1 from its left rear. The driver of V2 (sole occupant) was reported as belted. The 'morning rush hour' traffic had come to a stop ahead of V1 in the number-one lane. The driver applied his brakes and then swerved left, into the number-two lane and into the path of V2. The front right if V2 struck the left side of V1 in the area encompassing the back left door and wheel. The impact propelled V1 forward and to the right where it came to rest along the right shoulder/concrete barrier facing south. V2 came to rest south of the impact in the number-two lane facing south. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 (subject) was not transported directly from the scene of the crash, having a 'complaint of pain' as rated by police. The driver of V2 was not reported as injured.
