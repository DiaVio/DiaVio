This case focuses on a restrained 76 year old female driver in a 2014 Toyota Prius (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal, dual first row side airbags, dual side curtains, and a driver's knee bolster airbag. The driver's side inflatable curtain was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. V2, a 2004 Ford FreeStar was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal. The roadway that ran east and west was composed of eight asphalt lanes which were dry. There were five eastbound lanes and three westbound lanes. The roadway that ran north to south was composed of six dry asphalt lanes. The posted speed limit for the eastbound lane was 72 kph (45 mph). The eastbound lanes had an uphill grade. The posted speed limit for the southbound lane was 89 kph (55 mph). The southbound lanes had an uphill grade. V1 was stopped at the traffic signal while heading east in lane three of the eastbound lane awaiting to crossover the intersection. V2 was traveling south in lane two of the southbound lanes also attempting to crossover the intersection. V1 began to accelerate and enter the intersection in an attempt to crossover the intersection. While in the intersection the front of V2 contacted the left rear of V1. After impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and headed to final rest. V1 came to rest on the east leg of the intersection while in the far right lane, facing northeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise after impact and came to rest on the southbound leg of the intersection. It faced southeast at final rest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported from the crash scene to a local hospital. She was later transferred to a level one trauma center where she was treated for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
