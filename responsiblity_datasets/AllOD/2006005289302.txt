This two-vehicle crash occurred in the evening of a weekday in the middle of a four-way intersection, which was controlled by stop signs in all directions. All four legs of the intersection were two-way, two-lane roadways that were not physically divided. The bituminous roadway was level for V1, while there was a slight positive grade for V2. There was a posted speed limit of 40kmph (25mph) for both vehicles. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash, and the roadway was dry.

V1, a 2002 Freightliner Fire truck, was responding to a call traveling south in lane one intending to continue through the intersection. The truck's lights and sirens were activated as it approached the intersection. V2, a 2005 Ford Explorer Police vehicle, was also responding to a call traveling east in lane one, intending to continue through the intersection. V2 also had its lights and siren activated as it approached the intersection. As V1 entered the intersection it struck the left side of V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise approximately 45 degrees before coming to final rest in the northbound lane. V1 continued forward slightly, coming to final rest in the same lane of travel.
