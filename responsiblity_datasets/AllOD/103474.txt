Vehicle 1 (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Toyota Celica GT, 3-door hatchback was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous roadway was dry. The 21-year-old male driver (case occupant) was alone in the vehicle and lost control of his vehicle for an unknown reason. The case vehicle entered into a clockwise rotation and departed the right-side of the road with the left-side of the vehicle leading. V1 struck a wooden utility pole with the left door causing the pole to shear. The driver was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. This vehicle is not equipped with side-impact airbags. The driver was taken to a regional level-one trauma center via ground ambulance and hospitalized for treatment. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
