This is a three event crash involving a minor front-end to left side plane impact, a minor side plane to side plane impact and a severe front-end impact with a building. The severe impact resulted in severe injuries to the driver of the case vehicle (case occupant). The case vehicle a 2006 Mercedes Benz ML 350 SUV was going west on a dry, asphalt two-lane roadway approaching a four-leg intersection. It was day-light and there was no adverse weather. Vehicle two (V2) a 2004 four-door Toyota Camry was southbound on the intersecting roadway. As the case vehicle was crossing through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 hit the left fender of the case vehicle, causing it to rotate clockwise and V2 to rotate counterclockwise. V2 side-slapped the case vehicle and came to rest facing east. The case vehicle departed the roadway off the southeast corner of the intersection and impacted the corner of a church head on. Both vehicles towed due to damage. The 63-year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel and the seatback mounted side air bags and curtain bag deployed. She sustained severe injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
