This crash occurred at night on a two-lane asphalt roadway. This roadway traverses a deep, wide canyon and has a downgrade of -6% when going west. The posted speed is 105 kmph (65 mph) with a warning speed reduction of 40 kmph (25 mph) posted just before the bottom of this grade. There is a sharp sweeping left hand curve at the bottom with a radius of 86.5 meters (284 feet) for 200 meters (656 feet) of roadway. This roadway had no obvious defects and no adverse weather.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 GMC 1500 series pickup driven by a 24 year-old male, was traveling westbound negotiating the left hand curve when due to excessive speed it drifted right and over the right fog line. V1 continued thru the curve on the shoulder then steered left and back into its original travel lane. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and the driver applied right hand steering to correct the rotation. V1 then rotated clockwise and yawed right and off the right road edge. As V1 crossed the road shoulder it impacted a delineator with its left plane then traveled down into a dirt extended shoulder where it tripped with its left side tires and rolled over to the left onto its roof. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.
