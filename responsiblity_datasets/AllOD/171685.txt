Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford F150, 4-door pickup truck was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a 4-lane, divided, limited access freeway (two lanes eastbound, unprotected median, two lanes westbound). It was dark, the weather was clear, and the asphalt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and V1 drifted off the left edge of the pavement. The driver of V1 awoke and steered to the right but upon regaining the roadway V1 began a clockwise yaw. V1's yaw expanded as it crossed both lanes of travel and departed the right side of the road. V1 entered the roadside, grassy area and tripped over its left wheels just prior to entering a ditch. V1 began to roll with its left side leading and the top (hood) of V1 struck and knocked down a small tree while it was inverted 90 degrees. V2 completed the second quarter turn and then struckanother tree with the right doors while inverted 180 degrees. The right side of V1 then impacted the embankment and it continued to roll. V1 continued along the ditch, completing a total of six quarter turns. V1 came to rest on its roof, in the ditch, facing east. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 51-year-old male driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with critical (AIS-5) injuries.
