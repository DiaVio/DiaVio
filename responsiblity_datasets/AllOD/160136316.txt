Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mercury Sable sedan, was traveling in the northbound lane of a divided two-way city street under dry, daylight conditions and was negotiating a curve to the left. For unknown reasons V1 departed the roadway to the right side where it struck a small tree with its front and then the corner of a house with V1's front right corner. This impact with the house rotated V1 clockwise and V1 struck another tree and a metal fence with its left side before coming to final rest with its right tires off the roadway and its left tires on the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 79-year-old female was properly wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt and had no airbag deployment. The right front passenger in V1, a 76-year old male was also wearing his three-point lap and shoulder belt and had his seat-mounted side impact air bag deploy. Both occupants are case study occupants and both were transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
