Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Toyota Yaris sedan, was traveling south in lane one of a one lane leg of a two lane, divided trafficway under dry, dark conditions and with a curve to the left. Vehicle two, a 2003 Honda Element utility vehicle, was parked on the right side of the roadway facing south. Vehicle one failed to negotiate the curve in the road and the front of V1 struck the rear of V2. This impact rotated V1 counterclockwise where it struck a tree with its rear. The impact pushed V2 forward where it came to rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 19-year-old female and case study occupant was not wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her frontal, steering wheel mounted air bag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
