Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Chevrolet Impala, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. The driver of V1 was negotiating a left curve and the driver of V2 was negotiating a right curve. It was daylight, the weather was snow/blwoing snow, and the asphalt road surface was snow covered. The driver of V2 lost control on the icy road and V2 drove left of center and into the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 braked and reportedly came to a stop before the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in a full frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 65-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was not injured and did not seek medical attention. The 63-year-old female left-rear passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 3-year-old male right-rear passenger was seated in in a forward-facing child seat that was secured to the vehicle via the three-point seat belt. The child was secured to the child seat via a 5-point harness system. He was transported to a local hospital and treated and released with minor (AIS-1) injuries.
