Vehicle one (V1 -case vehicle), a 2004 Pontiac Grand Am, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a four-lane, divided, freeway (two lanes westbound, unprotected median, two lanes eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Chevrolet Venture, minivan was also traveling east in the left eastbound lane and was behind V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 2002 Oldsmobile Aurora, 4-door sedan was also traveling east in the left eastbound lane but was ahead of V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. V1 and V3 were slowing for traffic which was congested due to a construction zone/activity that was further upstream. The driver of V2 did not immediately recognize the lower speed of V1 until it was too late to avoid a collision. The driver of V2 braked but the front of V2 struck the rear of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 80 degrees and be accelerated forward and the left side of V1 struck the rear of V3. All three vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 53-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
