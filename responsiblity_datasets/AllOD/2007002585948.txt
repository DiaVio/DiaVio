The Nissan 350Z (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 24 year old male who was able to exit the vehicle under his own power. This driver, at first, refused medical attention. He was convinced to go to the hospital to be checked, by the police. This driver refused to respond to numerous attempts for an interview. It should be noted here that the driver was given summonses for intoxication and speeding. The medicals show that a blood test was given but the results were not sent. The medicals also have a statement from the driver saying that a motorcycle wanted to race with him but she said he did not want to race. The motorcycle then cut him off clipping the front end of his vehicle and that is when he lost control of his car and it went into the guardrail. It should also be noted that there was a summons for speeding, dated the day before the crash, on the seat in this vehicle.
