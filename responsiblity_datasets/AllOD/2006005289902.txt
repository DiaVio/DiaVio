This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a two-way, two-lane, roadway. The crash took place in the evening hours of a weekday and there were no streetlights illuminating the road. No adverse atmospheric conditions were present and the roadway was dry at the time of the collision. The grade for both vehicles was determined to be level. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 64kph (40mph).

V1, a 2002 Toyota Highlander, was traveling east on the roadway approaching his driveway. V2, a 2006 Toyota Scion, was traveling west on the roadway intending to continue straight. As the driver of V2 maneuvered his vehicle into position to back into his driveway his right front collided with the front left of V2. The impact caused V1 to rotate counter-clockwise approximately 90 degrees before coming to final rest. V2 continued in a forward motion shortly before coming to final rest. Both vehicles had to be removed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.
