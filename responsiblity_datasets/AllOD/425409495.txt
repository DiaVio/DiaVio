This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 50-year-old female unbelted driver of a 2007 Toyota Corolla compact sedan (Vehicle 1) with a deployed steering wheel airbag. She sustained moderate injuries in a frontal crash with severe damage when she was struck head-on by a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan minivan (Vehicle 2). The crash occurred during mid-evening hours in clear weather on a dry road. V1 was traveling southeast approaching a right curve on a rural bituminous two-way unmarked road. There was a 3% downhill grade for this vehicle. V2 was traveling northwest on the same road up an 11% grade preparing to negotiate a left curve. Both vehicles entered the same curve with V1 negotiating right and V2 towards the left. V2 traveled into V1's direction of travel. The front plane of V1 was impacted by the front plane of V2 in an offset frontal configuration (Event 1). Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise, coming to rest in the road. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 50-year-old female unbelted case occupant. The status of her retractor pretensioner was indeterminate as it was cut by rescue and used to tie down parts. The available steering wheel hub and right top instrument panel airbags were deployed. This vehicle was not equipped with seatback or curtain airbags. The driver suffered moderate injuries and was transported by air to a trauma center. V1 was also occupied by a 57-year-old male right front passenger. He was using the available lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. His available front instrument panel airbag deployed. He was transported to a nearby hospital for treatment of police-reported serious injuries.
