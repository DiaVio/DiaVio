Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Ford Focus, 4-door hatchback was traveling south in the inside southbound lane of a four-lane, two-way urban road (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound). V1 had just passed through a controlled intersection and was signaling a left-turn into a commercial parking lot just past the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1987 Chevrolet V10, 2-door pickup with a front snow plow attachment was traveling north in the right northbound lane of the same road and was approaching the controlled intersection. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the asphalt road surface was dry. A non-contact vehicle was stationary in the left northbound lane waiting for the traffic signal to change and waved the driver of V1 to make his left turn. The driver of V1 began to turn left. When V1 began to cross the right northbound lane he failed to see V2 approaching. The driver of V2 applied the brakes but was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 50 degrees while being redirected off the road and the front of V1 endswiped the front of a parked and unoccupied motor vehicle (1998 Buick LeSabre, 4-door sedan). V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage, while V3 was driveable. The 35-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital were he was treated and released with minor injuries. The 41-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
