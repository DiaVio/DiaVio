This case involves a left side crash event resulting in serious injuries to the left 2nd row seated case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Honda Odyssey minivan, was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway and vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Ford Econoline E250 large van, was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. The collision occurred at a T-type intersection of the north-south road and east-west road. The intersection is controlled by a stop sign for the northbound traffic. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the bituminous (asphalt) road was dry. The crash occurred when V1 made a left turn at the intersection onto the westbound roadway. The frontal plane of V2 impacted the left side plane of V1. Upon impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing west in the westbound traffic lane. V2 came to rest facing north on the westbound roadway. Both the vehicles contacted the north side concrete barrier before the final rest. The 42-year-old female driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The 13-year-old male left second row passenger (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt. Both were transported by the ground transportation to the nearest trauma center with serious injuries.
