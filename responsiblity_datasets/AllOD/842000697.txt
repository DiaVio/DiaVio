This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 74 year old female driver of a 2003 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS 2-door coupe. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions (non-deployed). Vehicle 1 sustained moderate left side damage as a result of an oblique angle collision with a 2001 Dodge 3500 Series Quad Cab 4x4 turbo diesel heavy duty pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was stopped and facing southbound on a freeway off-ramp at the intersection with a local connector. Vehicle 2 was westbound on approach to the intersection with the freeway off-ramp. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. It should be noted that Vehicle 2 was a heavy duty pickup truck (GVWR >10,000 lb.) towing a 24 foot trailer (trailer linkage type/trailer cargo unknown). Vehicle 1 attempted to proceed southbound across the intersection (back onto the freeway), and across the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 crossed the intersection, the left side surface was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage. At this point, the trailer affixed to Vehicle 2 struck the rear bed area of the pickup truck (event #2). Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the westbound lane of the intersection facing west. Vehicle 2 came to rest in the center turning lane of the east/west roadway facing west. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
