Collision Type:

2003 Dodge Durango versus a tree

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

This single vehicle collision occurred on a two-lane east/west roadway. Vehicle 1, a 2003 Dodge Durango, was traveling eastbound. The posted speed limit for Vehicle 1 was 56 KPH (35 MPH). The eastbound travel lane, prior to the departure area, curved left, but is level and free of any defects.

Vehicle 1 was being driven eastbound on the two-lane roadway by a 48 year old female driver (case occupant), who was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder restraint. The vehicle was also equipped with a driver's frontal air bag which deployed during the crash.

The driver of Vehicle 1, apparently, lost control of the vehicle while attempting to negotiating a left turning curve. The vehicle departed the right side of the roadway, traveled approximately 76 meters (250 feet), and struck a tree with its front plane. The driver's air bag deployed during this impact. After the impact, Vehicle 1 came to a final rest position against the struck tree, facing east.

Additional damage to the vehicle occurred during the extrication of the driver. The fire department personnel cut the windshield and the "A" pillars, pulled back the roof (approx. to the "B" pillar position) and pried open the left front door.

The 48 year old female driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) sustained minor to major injuries in this crash, and was transported, by air, to a trauma center for treatment. She was released from the trauma center 7 days post crash.

Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to the damage sustained in this collision.
