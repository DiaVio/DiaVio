Then the left side of the pickup truck's bed impacted an embankment on the south side of this slope. V1 came to final rest on its roof top against this embankment. Vehicle was towed from the scene but was still driveable. The case subject is the driver, a 42 year old male who was not wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and was not ejected.
