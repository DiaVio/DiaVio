This crash occurred on a two-lane, unmarked roadway, early in the morning on a weekday. There was one eastbound lane and one westbound lane. From the westbound lane the roadway curved to the right and then curved back to the left while going downhill. The eastbound lane curved to the right had an uphill slope. The roadway was bituminous with a posted speed limit of 24 kmph (15 mph).

V1 was a 1992 Chrysler LeBaron, driven by a 23 year-old male. V2 was a 1990 Buick Park Avenue, driven by a 50 year-old male. V1 was traveling westbound in the middle of the road, and was negotiating the left curve of the roadway when it struck V2 in the front. V2 was traveling eastbound in lane one and was negotiating a right curve when it was struck by V1. After impact with V1, V2's engine compartment caught on fire, eventually fully engulfing the vehicle. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was “this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on left side of travel lane.” The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was “driver related factor, too fast for curve.” In the narrative of the PAR the driver stated that he was traveling at approximately 35-40 mph, which is well over the speed limit for the roadway. The vehicle left approximately 17 meters of skid marks from braking lock-up. The roadway is also marked with chevrons to alert of the sharp left curve.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was “other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction-over left lane line.” The Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. The driver stated that he saw the other vehicle towards him in the middle of the roadway. He slowed down and steered as far to the right of the roadway as he could but was unable to avoid the impact. After impact he saw that the front of the vehicle was on fire, but due to the driver door being jammed from the collision and the power windows shorting out, he had to climb out of the passengers side window, which was down at the time.
