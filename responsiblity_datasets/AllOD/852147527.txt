This case occupant is a 61 year old male driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt in a severe rollover collision and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during clear daylight hours with icy surface conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Dodge RAM truck was southbound on a two lane, two way road that curved to the left with a downgrade. V1 lost control due to the icy conditions and departed the roadway to the right down a steep embankment while rotating clockwise. With V1 tilted forward down the embankment and starting to rollover to the left, the top hood impacted a tree as the left side at the left front tire and A-pillar impacted a second tree. V1 continued to roll over left as the roof top impacted a third tree and the top of the truck bed impacted a fourth tree before the back impacted a fifth tree. The left side of V1 then contacted the ground and came to final rest angled on the embankment facing northeast. V1 was damaged and disabled. The driver of V1, a 61 year old male, was the sole occupant and was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt and no airbags deployed. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
