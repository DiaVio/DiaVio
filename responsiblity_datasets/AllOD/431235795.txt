This multiple crash case involves a 42 year old restrained male seated in the front left (Driver) seating position without a deployed steering wheel air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred in the early morning hours (dark but lighted) in wet and rainy weather. The collision occurred on a level four lane bituminous roadway with a shoulder on the left and right side. The southbound and northbound lanes are separated by a concrete barrier. The case vehicle (V1), a 2007 four-door Ford Taurus, was being driven southbound in the inboard lane prior to the crash. The crash occurred when V1 was traveling southbound and traveled across three travel lanes and the right southbound shoulder before departing the roadway. V1 traveled off the roadway onto the grass and impacted a breakaway light pole with its front bumper (knocking it to the ground). V1 then continued on impacting a sign pole with its left door before traveling to its final resting position facing east. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 42 year old male case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt. The buckle type pretensioner actuated (6 cm) as a result of the crash. The available steering wheel mounted air bag did not deploy as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned between the middle and rear position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was injured in the crash and transported by ground ambulance to a level 1 trauma center for treatment of his injuries.
