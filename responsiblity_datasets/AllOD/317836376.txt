This case focuses on a restrained 74 year old female right rear passenger in a 2-door 2015 Honda Civic (V1). There was also a 44 year old restrained driver and a restrained 23 year old male right front passenger in V1. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The frontal airbags were the only airbags to deploy during the crash. V2, a 2008 Buick Enclave was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on the northbound side of a divided interstate traffic way. Part of the traffic way was divided by a concrete barrier, grass, and a guardrail, respectively. The northbound lanes consisted of four one-way lanes with shoulders on both sides of the roadway. The roads were lighted by overhanging street lights. The roadway surface was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 97 kph (60 mph). V1 was traveling in lane three of the northbound lanes. V2 was traveling ahead of V1 while also in the northbound lane. Traffic began to slow causing the driver of V2 to decelerate. The driver of V1 noticed V2 slowing and applied her brakes in an attempt to avoid contact with the slowing vehicle. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V2. V1 continued northwest and departed the roadway to the left where it contacted a guardrail face with its front. V1 came to rest on the left shoulder facing the guardrail. V2 continued left off the roadway and came to rest in the median, facing northwest. The right rear passenger was transported by ambulance to a level one trauma center where she received treatment for moderate injuries that she sustained in the crash. The driver was uninjured and did not seek treatment. The right front passenger was transported to trauma center with unknown injuries. His treatment status is unknown.
