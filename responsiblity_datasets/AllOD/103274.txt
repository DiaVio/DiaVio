Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle) a 1990 Ford F150, 2-door pickup truck was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was dark with no streetlights, the weather was cloudy and the bituminous road surface was wet. The 29-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available 3-point seatbelt but this vehicle is not equipped with airbags. The driver reportedly fell asleep, drove left-of-center, crossed the eastbound lane and departed the left shoulder of the road. V1 traveled along the shoulder and sideswiped a large tree with the left side of his vehicle. This impact re-directed the path of V1 so that it was travelling parallel to the road and V1 continued until it struck another large tree with the front end. Cargo in the truck bed shifted forward and impacted the back of the cab causing additional damage and intrusion. The vehicle was towed from the scene due to disabling damage and the driver was transported via ground amublance to a regional level-one trauma center.
