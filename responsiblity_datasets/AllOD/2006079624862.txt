This two-vehicle collision occurred during night hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The speed limit for north-south traffic was 56 kmph (35 mph); the limit for east-west traffic was 40 kmph (25 mph). The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Volkswagen Jetta four-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the first lane of a five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the intersection with the intention of turning right. V1 lost traction as it executed the turn, traversed both lanes of the east-west roadway in a clockwise yaw, and departed the road over the north curb, causing damage to the left front axle. V1 moved east and re-entered the roadway, where the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, a legally parked 2005 Toyota Camry four-door sedan. Both vehicles moved east to final rest against the north curb. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 26-year-old male driver of V1 reported that he was traveling too fast to execute the turn. He claimed that the occupants of a non-contact vehicle in the adjacent northbound lane were harassing him, and that he executed the unsafe turn in an attempt to get away from the other vehicle. The presence of the other vehicle is uncorroborated.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1 and was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn.
