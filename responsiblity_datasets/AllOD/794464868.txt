This case involves an impact between the left side of a passenger car and the front-end of a van. The case occupant is the unrestrained 32-year-old female driver. The case vehicle, a 2005 four-door Nissan Maxima was travelling in the outside, southbound lane of a dry, level, concrete, five-lane trafficway separated by a raised median, approaching a four-leg intersection. It was dark, but lighted and clear. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Chevrolet Venture van, was westbound in the through lane of the intersecting road. The case vehicle entered the path of V2 and was struck on the left fender. After impact, the case vehicle rotated clockwise, while V2 rotated counterclockwise and the two vehicles side-slapped. The case vehicle came to rest on the intersecting road in the eastbound through lane facing south-southwest and V2 came to rest at the southwest corner of the intersection, in the eastbound through lane facing south. The driver was the only occupant in the case vehicle. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the seat back, roof side-rail and steering-wheel mounted air bags deployed. She was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
