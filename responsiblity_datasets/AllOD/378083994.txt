This crash occurred on a 2-lane residential street. The trafficway is situated in a north to south configuration and is comprised of 2 undivided lanes with a parking lane located on the east side of the roadway. At the time of the crash it was early morning, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Traffic for that time of the day is light. Involved in the crash was the case vehicle (V1) a 1999 Mitsubishi Galant 4-door sedan equipped with manual 3-point lap and shoulder restraints for each outboard seating position. In addition to the manual restraints, V1 is also equipped with a driver and right passenger frontal impact air bags, both of which deployed in the crash. The driver of V1 was an 18-year-old male. He was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. Also involved in the crash were 2 Principal Other Vehicles (POVs). POV 1 (V2) was a 2000 Chrysler Concorde 4-door sedan. POV 2 (V3) was a 2003 Ford Mustang 2-door coupe, which was properly parked and unoccupied. V1 was traveling in a southerly direction in the proper lane. V3 was legally parked facing north. V2 was traveling in a northerly direction in the proper lane. As V2 proceeded north, the driver turned left in an attempt to enter a driveway to an apartment complex. When V2 turned left it struck the case vehicle in a right frontal offset collision where the right front of V2 struck the right front of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotate in a clockwise direction approximately 90 degrees. As V1 was rotating clockwise, the left corner of the rear bumper sideswiped the left side of V3. V1 came to final rest facing in a westerly direction. The impact to V3 was minor and the parked vehicle did not require towing. The driver of the case vehicle did not loose consciousness in the crash. He was removed from V1 by the paramedics and transported to the trauma center via helicopter with a trauma criterion of a systolic blood pressure of less than 90.
