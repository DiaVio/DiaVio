Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 23-year old, right front, female passenger, of a 2007 Kia Spectra 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a frontal collision with the frontal plane of a 2010 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan (parked vehicle). Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the post mid-night hours (dark, street lamps present) of a late fall weeknight, on a two-lane, north/south residential roadway (on street parking on either side of the roadway). For the northbound travel direction, the roadway has a left turning curve which straightens just prior to the actual impact area. The roadway is level with a speed limit of 25 mph (40 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2007 Kia Spectra 4-door sedan, was being operated by a 28-year old male driver (case occupant) in the northbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was noted to be utilizing his 3-point lap/shoulder belt at the time. Occupying the right front seating position was the 23-year old female passenger (case occupant), who was unbelted at the time. Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, roof side rail curtains and front, seat back mounted, side air bags. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 departed its travel lane at or near the termination of the left turning section of roadway and crossed through the southbound travel lane, heading in a northwesterly direction. Prior to exiting the west side of the roadway, Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck the frontal plane of a parked 2010 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan. Prior to coming to rest at the west roadside edge, Vehicle 1 struck a curb with its left front wheel/rim (event 2) and then a street lamp pole with its left side (sill area / event 3). Vehicle 2, the parked 2010 Chevrolet Impala was displaced from its position and continued traveling backwards while turning. Vehicle 2 eventually rolled to a stop at the east roadside edge, facing a southwesterly direction. Due to the impact with the parked vehicle, Vehicle 1's frontal air bags deployed. Post-Crash: Both the driver and right front passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center. The driver was treated and released with minor injuries, while the passenger was hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. Both vehicles had to be towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
