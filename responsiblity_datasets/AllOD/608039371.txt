The case vehicle a 1999 Nissan Pathfinder SUV was eastbound on a level, slushy two-lane concrete roadway approaching a six-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 1999 Sterling van body straight-truck was westbound in the inside lane of the east-west roadway approaching the same intersection. The case vehicle made a left-turn as V2 was negotiating a slight right-sweeping curve leading to the roadway intersecting at a diagonal (NW to SE). The front of the case vehicle struck the left side of V2. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise before it came to a rest facing northwest. V2 came to a controlled stop in the outside lane of the roadway intersecting at a diagonal facing northwest. The case vehicle was towed from the scene. V2 was driven away. The 30-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transferred to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and later enrolled as a case occupant.
