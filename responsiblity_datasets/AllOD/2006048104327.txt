This single vehicle crash occurred during morning daylight hours on a five lane, uphill, bituminous, wet roadway that supports two-way traffic and runs east to west. This roadway intersects with a level, two-lane, bituminous roadway that runs north to south. This intersection was controlled by a stop sign for the southbound lane. It was raining at the time of the crash and the roadway was wet.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford Econoline 15 passenger public transportation van, driven by a 73 year-old male with five passengers was traveling westbound in lane one. V1 departed the roadway to the right and the front of V1 struck a fire hydrant and a light pole, then the undercarriage struck a cement curb. Post-impact V1 came to rest facing north in the southbound lane. V 1 was towed from the scene and one passenger was transported to a local medical facility. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of V1 was a 73-year-old male. He stated that a non-contact vehicle attempted a right turn in front of his vehicle. This driver misjudged the forward gap distance & speed of the non-contact vehicle and steered right to avoid an impact.

The critical reason for the critical event was a driver related factor: poor directional control. The driver stated he chose to go right to avoid hitting the non-contact vehicle in the lane.
