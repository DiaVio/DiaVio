This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 57 year old female driver of a 2003 Honda Civic EX 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1995 Mitsubishi Mirage S 2-door coupe (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the same roadway and negotiating a right curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 2 reached the apex of the curve and crossed the centerline, into the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the westbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest off the north pavement edge facing southwest, as Vehicle 2 came to rest off the south pavement edge facing northeast. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
