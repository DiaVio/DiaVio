This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on the exit ramp of a high speed, high volume, interstate highway. The one-way eastbound exit ramp consisted of one wide lane flanked by grassy shoulders and a steel guardrail on the right side of the travel lane. The bituminous, dry roadway curved sharply to the right. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 2004 Chevy Aveo (please not that on the PAR the police officer listed V1 as a 1991 Toyota, however the driver told me on scene that she had recently transferred the plates from her old vehicle), was northbound on the highway preparing to exit on the eastbound ramp. As V1 exited the highway it was traveling too fast for the curvature of the roadway. V1 departed the roadway to the left as the driver attempted to brake and steer right she lost control. V1 crossed over the travel lane, over the grassy shoulder and struck the guardrail with the front plane. V1 came to final rest facing west on the shoulder of the exit ramp. V1 was towed due to damages. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.

The driver of V1, a 42-year-old woman, was on her way to drop her mother off at an appointment. She stated that she lost control on the exit ramp as she negotiated the curve of the roadway. She believed she was traveling too fast to navigate the curve. She lost control when she departed the roadway to the left crossed to the right side and struck the guardrail. Both the driver and her passenger were transported for treatment of non-incapacitating injuries.
