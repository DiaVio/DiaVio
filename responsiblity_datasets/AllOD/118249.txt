Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Ford Focus, 3-door hatchback was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way bituminous rural roadway. The driver was negotiating an S-curve (curve to left, then to right) while traversing through a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer, utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way road. This road is controlled by stop signs and is straight, bi-secting the S-curve of the intersecting road. It was daylight, but the sun was in the western horizon, the weather was clear and the roads were dry. The driver of V2 was unfamiliar with the road and claimed a vision impairment due to the sun. V2 and V1 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. V1 and V2 remianed engaged for sevral meters as both vehicles moved to the west. V1 began to rotate clockwise while separating from V2. V1 rotated approximately 100 degrees from its original heading and the rear of V1 struck a sign post during this rotation. V1 came to rest in a private lawn facing east. V2 came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder of the west leg of the intersection facing west. Both vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 23-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. The 22-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and the right-front passenger (case occupant) was subsequently transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
