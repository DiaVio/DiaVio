This moderate severity crash involved a frontal impact followed by a right side impact. The case occupant was a 46 year old male driver who was not belted but had a frontal airbag deployment. This driver sustained severe injuries and was taken to the trauma center. This single vehicle crash occurred on a curved section of a two lane, two way east/west roadway in a dark, rural area without street lights. The travel lanes were bordered with loose gravel shoulders. On the south side there was a drainage ditch filled with water and there was a sloped embankment between it and the roadway. The weather was clear with dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Mazda 3 four-door sedan, was traveling westbound and negotiating the curve to the right at a high rate of speed. On the inside portion of the curve, V1's right tires went off the edge of the north side of the roadway and traveled onto the loose gravel shoulder. As V1 returned all four tires to the roadway, the driver lost control of V1, crossed over the opposite lane and departed the roadway to the left into the drainage ditch. The front of V1 impacted the muddy embankment on the south side of the ditch. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and V1's right rear impacted the embankment. V1 continue to rotate and came to final rest in the drainage ditch facing west. V1 was towed disabled. The driver is the case occupant and no other passengers were in the vehicle. This driver is a 46 year old male and was not belted. The frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed in his position. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
