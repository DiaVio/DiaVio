This case occupant is a 35 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a severe frontal impact with both frontal and roof side rail curtain air bag deployments. He sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Cadillac Escalade large utility vehicle, was southbound in lane one of a two lane, one way roadway. This concrete roadway is straight and level and is divided from the northbound travel lanes by a wide raised median that accommodates light rail trains. While traveling south, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, crossed over lane two and began to depart the roadway to the left. V1's left front tire impacted the curb, resulting in minor tire and rim damage. Then V1's left rear tire impacted the curb, also resulting in minor damage. V1 continued traveling in a southeasterly direction, crossed over a set of train tracks, and then the front of V1 impacted a metal non-breakaway pole, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal and left side curtain air bags and the actuation of his seat belt retractor pretensioner. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest, still in the median, facing south. V1 was towed due to damage.
