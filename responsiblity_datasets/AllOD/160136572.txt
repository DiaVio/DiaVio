Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Ford Focus sedan, was traveling west in lane two of a four lane leg of a six lane, divided trafficway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Ford F450 medium/heavy with a trailer, was stopped in lane two of the same trafficway waiting at a controlled intersection. Vehicle three (V3), a 1989 International S1900 medium/heavy with a trailer, was stopped in lane four of the same traffic way also waiting at a controlled intersection. V1 was unable to stop due to a medical emergency and V1's front contacted the rear of V2. This impact sent V1 into a clockwise spin. V1 crossed lane three and entered lane four while spinning clockwise where it struck the right side of V3 with its right side. V1 came to final rest in lane three of the roadway while V2 came to rest in lane two and V3 came to rest in lane four. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, an 80-year-old female and case study occupant, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the vehicle's frontal airbag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
