This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 29 year old female driver of a 2014 Audi Q7 Quattro 3.0T Premium Plus AWD 4-door sport utility. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags/seat back mounted side air bags (for the driver and front right passenger positions), and curtain air bags (for all outboard seating positions). The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of a narrow end engagement with a large diameter tree (event 1). The crash occurred off the west pavement edge of a 2-lane north/south rural roadway. The asphalt surfaced road curved right (with a negative grade) for northbound vehicles. The roadway was bordered to the west by stands of trees and to the east by thick wooded areas. It was dark (street not lighted by overhead lamps); with rainy weather conditions as the road was wet. The posted speed limit at the crash site was 72 km/h (45 mph). Vehicle 1 was northbound on the straightaway as it entered the right curve and proceeded downhill. As the case vehicle reached the apex of the curve it departed the left (west) pavement edge and entered a stand of trees. The front left area impacted a large diameter pine tree resulting in severe damage (event 1). At this point, the left front side surface struck an adjacent large diameter pine tree which resulted in moderate damage (event 2). A third tree was struck resulting in minor damage over the left rear wheel (event 3). Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in close proximity to the struck trees (off the west pavement edge) facing northwest. The restrained 29 year old female driver of the 2014 Audi Q7 sport utility was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-rear track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At impact 1, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force. The driver's boots were found wedged in between the seat cushion and intruded instrument panel. Entrapment of the driver's lower extremities was confirmed by this contact pattern relative to the extent of intruded components into the occupant space. At impact 2, the driver kinematic was re-directed to the left in response to the 9 o'clock impact force. Following the collision, the restrained driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injury. The case vehicle was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
