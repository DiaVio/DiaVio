Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 GMC Sonoma, 2-door regular cab, 4x2 pickup was traveling north in the left northbound lane on a five lane, two-way roadway (two lanes northbound, bidirectional center turn-lane, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Chevrolet, unknown model pickup was traveling south in the left southbound lane of the same roadway. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the concrete road surface was dry. The driver of V1, due to a medical condition, relinquished control of his vehicle and it moved to the left, crossed the center turn-lane and entered the left southbound lane. The driver of V2 braked as an avoidance maneuver and was nearly at a stop but the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a full frontal mode. Final rest of the two vehicles was reportedly at the same location as the impact. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage while V2 was driven away. The 63-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
