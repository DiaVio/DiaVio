This case involved a 67 year old restrained female driver of a 2007 Toyota Tacoma extended cab pickup truck (V1). She was restrained by the available three point lap and shoulder belt. V1 was equipped with frontal airbags which did not deploy in the crash. There were no side impact airbags available in this vehicle. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 1995 GMC Sierra regular cab pickup truck (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours at the intersection of two roadways. V1 was northbound on a two-lane dry asphalt roadway with a 4% downhill grade attempting to turn left at the intersection. V2 was traveling in the right lane of the three eastbound lanes of a divided highway. As V1 crossed over the eastbound lanes, V2 swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision with V1. The front of V2 impacted the left front quarter panel of V1, causing V1 to rotate 90 degrees clockwise and sideslap with the left side of V1 contacting the right side of V2. V1 came to rest in the crossover of the intersection facing southeast. V2 continued forward and came to rest on the left shoulder of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (case subject) was airlifted to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to injuries sustained in the crash.
