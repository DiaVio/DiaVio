This case involved the belted male driver of a sport utility vehicle responding to a near side (left) collision with a small pickup. The case vehicle damage rating was 'severe' as a result of the nine o'clock principal direction of force impact(s) while the subject sustained serious injury. This two-vehicle crash occurred at the three-way intersection of a five-lane, divided, north/south trafficway and a three-lane, east/west, street adjoining from the west. The east/west street had a single lane for travel in each direction and a left turn lane (for east to north) separated by painted double yellow lines. The eastbound approach to the intersection was straight and had a slight upward grade. The southbound approach to the intersection was level and curved slightly right. The intersection was controlled by tri-color traffic signals. The weather was clear and the roads dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was traveling eastbound on its approach to the intersection with the intention of turning left. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, and frontal-impact air bags. The forty-six year old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on the condition found. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1974 Chevrolet C10 pickup) was traveling southbound on its approach to the intersection with the intention of traveling straight through. V1 began its left turn maneuver, traveling into the intersection and placing V1 in the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left front of V1. The impact rotated V1 approximately one hundred-thirty degrees clockwise and deflected it south. V1 came to rest in the southbound lanes facing southwest. V2, meanwhile, had deflected to the left, into the left turn lane of the northbound approach where it came to rest facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case subject (driver of V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
