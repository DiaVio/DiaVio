This case occupant is a 64 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a minor frontal crash followed by a minor right side impact and a severe rollover event. There were no air bag deployments. He sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way, roadway during daylight hours under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. In V1's precrash area, the two asphalt lanes are straight with a downhill grade for eastbound vehicles. There are no curbs on either side of the lanes and on the south side of the street there are grassy strips, shallow ditches and private driveways present. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Ford Explorer compact utility vehicle, was eastbound in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Nissan compact pickup towing a boat on a trailer, was traveling east in lane one, ahead of V1. V1 approached V2 at a higher rate of speed. The driver of V1 braked and steered right, but the front left of V1 impacted the back of the boat. The force of the impact caused the boat to fall off the trailer and come to final rest in lane one, facing northeast. V1 departed the roadway to the right and traveled into a shallow ditch. V1 left the ditch while in a counterclockwise yaw and crossed a paved driveway. The right side of V1 impacted a mailbox post, shearing it from its base, and resulting in minor damage. V1 returned to the roadway, continued a short distance east and began to trip-over with the right side leading. V1 rolled eight quarter turns before coming to final rest straddling both lanes, facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene. The case occupant in V1 is the 64 year old male driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
