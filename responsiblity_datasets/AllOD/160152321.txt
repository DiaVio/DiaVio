This near-sided crash involves a 59-year-old restrained female with deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred at the intersection of two six-lane trafficways. Both trafficways are divided into separate roadways and both are level. The intersection is controlled by a four-way traffic light. The case vehicle (V1), a 2008 Pontiac Torrent utility vehicle, was traveling north and was approaching the intersection from a stop. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Ford E-250 van, was traveling east and was approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. After initial impact, the left side of V1 side slapped the right side of V2 and both vehicles came to rest in the southeast portion of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven b a 59-year-old case study occupant. She was properly wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her frontal air bag deploy. The case vehicle also contained a 40-year old right front passenger who was unbelted and had her frontal air bag deploy. In addition, the case vehicle contained a 3-year-old male who was restrained in a booster seat in the left rear position. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
