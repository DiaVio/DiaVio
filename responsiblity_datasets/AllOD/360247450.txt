This rollover crash case involves a 36 year old female driver, restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, with no air bag deployments and who sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes in a four legged intersection controlled by traffic signals. In the area where the crash occurred, the southbound, one-way roadway consists of three asphalt lanes with a downhill grade. The intersecting eastbound roadway consists of three asphalt lanes with an uphill grade. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Toyota 4Runner compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane one and vehicle 2 (V2), a 2006 Chrysler Sebring four door sedan, was traveling east in lane three of the intersecting roadway. V1 and V2 entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1, resulting in minor damage. V1 rotated slightly clockwise towards the southeastern corner of the intersection and began to rollover to the left. V1 rolled two quarter turn to the left, resulting in minor left side damage. V1 came to final rest in lane one, facing south, on its top. V2 came to final rest still in its lane, facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 36 year old female driver of V1 in the front left position who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant had no air bag deployments in her seating area. She sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The driver of V2 was not injured.
