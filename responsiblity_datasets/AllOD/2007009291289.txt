The crash occurred on the roadside of a two lane undivided roadway. This was a dry, bituminous, level road with a posted speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). Prior to the curve, there was a warning sign with a posted speed of 16 kmph (10 mph). There was a 90-degree curve left in the northbound direction just prior to the crash on this early morning on a weekend.

V1 was a 1999 Ford Taurus 4-door sedan driven by an unknown driver who fled the scene after the collision. The final rest of V1 was four meters off the right side of the northbound lane on the curve. The police reported inattention and traveling too fast for conditions as contributing factors. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

It was highly possible that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast to negotiate the ninety-degree left turn in the road and lost control of V1. V1 went off the road on the right side, where the vehicle's path was controlled by railroad ties lying on the ground two meters right of the road, in front of a white vinyl fence. The undercarriage of V1 struck one of the ties and V1 continued to veer right, striking the white fence. V1 continued on in a northerly direction and struck a tree with its right side. V1 continued forward and struck a wooden fence and then another tree with its front, coming to final rest against the tree.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was an unknown reason, as the driver fled the scene. No associated factors could be coded to V1 due to lack of an interview.
