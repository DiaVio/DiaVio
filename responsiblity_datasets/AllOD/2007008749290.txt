This crash occurred on a two-lane undivided roadway, early in the morning on a weekend. The roadway curved to the left, was level, bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Conditions were clear.

V1 was a 1994 Saturn SL 4-door sedan driven by a 26 year-old male. V1 was traveling northbound negotiating a curve to the left. As the vehicle negotiated the curve it went off of the roadway on the right side, reentered the roadway, crossed the double yellow lines into the southbound lane, reentered the northbound lane, and again departed the roadway on the right side. While off the roadway, the front right of V1 struck a railing attached to a building. The vehicle began to reenter the roadway for a second time, and as it did, it impacted the back of V2, which was a legally parked vehicle. V1 came to final rest in the northbound lane facing south. V2 was a 1995 Ford Windstar minivan. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1 and 80 kmph for V2.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was "driver related factor, too fast for curve." The PAR estimated the vehicle's speed at 50 mph, which seems consistent with the distance traveled by V1. It should also be noted that upon inspecting the vehicle, approximately one hour after the crash occurred, an open can of beer was observed in the console of the vehicle that was still cold. There was still beer in the can, and there was a distinct smell of alcohol in the vehicle. There was no mention of alcohol on the PAR. The driver of V1 could not be reached for an interview. Associated factors coded to the driver include excess speed, aggressive driving, inadequate evasive action, and poor directional control.
