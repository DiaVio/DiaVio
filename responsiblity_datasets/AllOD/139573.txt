Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Mercury Monterey, minivan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. As the two vehicles approached each other, the driver of V1 (due to a syncopal event from a medical condition) allowed his vehicle to cross the centerline and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 81-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate injuries. The 78-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries.
