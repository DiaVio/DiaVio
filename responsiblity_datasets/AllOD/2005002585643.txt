The crash occurred on a level four lane undivided roadway at a four-leg intersection controlled by a traffic signal. The posted speed limit was 35 MPH (56 KPH). It was raining, the roadway was wet and it was daylight at the time of this weekday morning crash.

Vehicle #1, a 1998 Ford Contour, was traveling west exiting a parking lot driveway controlled by a flashing red light. Vehicle #2, a 2000 Dodge Durango, was traveling north in the second lane of the main road approaching the intersection. Vehicle #1 entered the intersection to turn left and was struck in the left side by the front of Vehicle #2. Vehicle #1 was rotated counterclockwise, across the southbound lanes and came to rest off the road facing in a southeasterly direction. Vehicle #2 drove off the road to the right and stopped in a parking lot. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The Ford Contour (Vehicle #1) was driven by a belted 69 year old female who was transported, treated for fractured ribs and released from a local hospital. She stated that she had just left the feed store and was waiting to pull out to make a left hand turn. She indicated that she had been stopped for more than 10 seconds prior to proceeding and waited until other traffic had a red light as she always did. She stated that other vehicles had stopped, but the vehicle that hit her didn't. She stated she wore glasses for myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (far-sighted) conditions. She had a hearing deficiency and was wearing a hearing aid at the time of the crash. She considered herself in fair health.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was false assumption of other's actions. This was chosen because her statement "all the other cars stopped" led her to believe he would stop also. It should be noted that this driver had a flashing red light; while the main road had steady lights and it is possible the light had just changed for V2. An associated factor coded to this driver was the use of prescription medications. She was taking twelve medications: (a) a calcium channel blocker with possible side effects of dizziness, (b) a beta blocker with mild or uncommon side effects, (c) 2 high blood pressure medications with possible side effects of drowsiness, dizziness or fatigue, (d) a allergy medication with possible side effects of drowsiness or fatigue, (e) a cholesterol medication, (f) 2 stomach medications, (g) a pain medication with the possible side effect of drowsiness, (h) an anti-depressant with possible side effects of sedation, blurred vision, confusion and sensitivity to bright light, (i) a glaucoma medication with a possible side effect of blurred vision and (j) an unknown medication.

The Dodge Durango (Vehicle #2) was driven by a belted 61-year-old male who was not injured. The right front seat belted 62-year-old male passenger also was not injured. Since this driver did not speak English limited information was obtained through a friend. He indicated that he had been traveling at a normal speed for the roadway and that "she came out of nowhere". He attempted to brake, but it was too late. He was in good health, wore corrective lenses for an unknown condition and took no medications.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was other vehicle encroaching from a driveway turning into opposite direction. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. It is possible that since this vehicle was traveling in the second lane approaching the intersection that traffic had been stopped in the right lane masking this driver's view of Vehicle #1 as he entered the intersection. No other associated factors were coded to the driver of the Durango and he was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
