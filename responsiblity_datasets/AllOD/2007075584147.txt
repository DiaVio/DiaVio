This two-vehicle crashed occurred in a three-leg intersection at the crest of a small hill. The eastern leg of the intersection was not involved in the pre-crash travel for the two involved vehicles. On the north side of the intersection, there was one through lane and one left turn lane for southbound and one northbound lane. On the south side of the intersection, it was divided by a painted median with one through lane and one right turn lane for northbound and one through lane for southbound. This was a straight, uphill for both the north & south directions coming to a slight hillcrest, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was late afternoon on a weekend, the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was moderate.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Nissan Sentra four-door sedan with three occupants, was southbound in lane two, the turn lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Honda Accord two-door with one occupant, was northbound in line two, the through lane. A truck in front of V1 was able to make a left turn and V1 followed and entered the intersection at the same time as V2. The driver of V2 applied the brakes, which locked up, to avoid the collision. V1 impacted with its front to V2's front. V1 started to rotate counterclockwise and came to rest on its wheels facing northeast on the northeast side of the intersection. V2 stared to rotate counterclockwise into the westbound lanes, over the curbed median and into the eastbound lane where it came to rest on its wheels facing south in both eastbound lanes. Both vehicles were towed from the scene of the crash due to moderate frontal damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, the Nissan Sentra is a 17 year-old female who was transported to a trauma center for precautionary purposes due to her age. The officer at the scene advised the researcher that a small dog was loose in the vehicle and was running around in the car before the crash and feels the driver was distracted. The dog was on-scene and is a 3-pound Yorkie. The driver was at the mall earlier buying clothes and lost her cell phone. She was on her way back to the mall from home to find the phone when the crash occurred. She stated she was upset and was talking to the front seat passenger. She was well rested, takes no medicine or drugs and wears glasses, only at night to see. She stated she was following the truck when she made her turn and saw V2 about two seconds prior to impact.

The driver of V2, the Honda Accord is a 26 year-old male, who reported no injures. He had just left home and was on his way to another mall when the crash occurred. He stated a black truck turned left in front of him, which had room and V2 followed. He was well rested and had not taken any drugs or medicine in the last 24 hours because he had just gotten over a cold a couple of days before. He was driving his fathers car, but had driven it more then ten times in the past three month.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). Three associative factors were: this driver has had her permit for 10 months with a restriction that a person 21 years of age or older must be in the vehicle; she was upset she lost her phone at the mall, and she did not look far enough ahead. The forward vehicle may have partially masked her view of V2 as she was not aware of V2's presence until just before impact.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
