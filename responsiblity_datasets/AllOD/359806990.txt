This moderate severity near-side impact crash involved a 48 year old male driver who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. His roof side rail curtain and steering column mounted airbags both deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center. This crash occurred at an intersection during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions. At the intersection a two lane, two way roadway created a T intersection from the north side with a two lane, two way east/west highway bordered by narrow paved shoulders. This highway slightly curves at this intersection and also widens for an eastbound left turn lane and is bordered on the south with a grassy ditch. The southbound lane at the intersection was controlled by a stop sign and there are no traffic controls for the east and westbound highway traffic. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Kia Sorento compact utility vehicle, was stopped southbound at the intersection attempting to make a left turn. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford Ranger pickup pulling a boat on a trailer, was in the westbound lane as the highway slightly curves to the left and was approaching the intersection. V1 began to make a left turn and entered the intersection. V2 began to lock up the brakes and swerved to the left and departed the lane slightly to the left. The front of V2 then impacted the left side of V1 in the middle of the intersection. V1 was then forced laterally in a southwesterly direction, leaving heavy right side tire marks as the vehicle began to tilt to the right. V1 then rolled one quarter turn to the right, and came to final rest on its right side in the grassy ditch on the southwest area of the intersection with its right rear tire still partially on the paved shoulder. V2 post impact began to rotate counterclockwise toward the west, and the trailer also rotated with V2. The boat came off the trailer and slid west some distance from the intersection in the eastbound lane. V2 came to final rest facing north just west of the intersection across the eastbound left turn and eastbound lane of the highway with the trailer still attached. Both vehicles were towed and disabled. The case occupant was the driver in V1. He was 48 year old male and was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the left roof side rail mounted curtain airbag and the front steering column mounted airbag both deployed in his position on impact. He sustained serious injuries and was airlifted from the scene to the trauma center. Two other passengers were in V1. A 53 year old female was seated in the front right position wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the instrument panel airbag deployed in her position. She sustained no significant injuries. The other passenger, a 22 year old female, was seated in the second row left position wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the left roof side rail curtain airbag deployed. It was reported that she did not sustain any significant injuries.
