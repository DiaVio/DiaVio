The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted that he did not look to the right side before entering the intersection, and he never saw Vehicle Two (V2) approaching. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision. Additionally, V1's driver admitted to being distracted by talking with his four occupants just before the crash. This distraction likely contributed to his failure to properly check for oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and driver error.
