The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the intersecting roadway while V2, the 2007 Ford Mustang, was traveling straight through the intersection. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a slower speed of 40 kph (25 mph) compared to V2's speed of approximately 80 kph (50 mph), further contributing to the accident.
