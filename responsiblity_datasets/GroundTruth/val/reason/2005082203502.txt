The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2 (2000 Dodge Caravan) while V2 was stopped at a red light. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that alcohol was present for the driver of V1, which suggests a possible impairment that could have contributed to the driver's error.
