The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 suffered a medical blackout, becoming dizzy and losing consciousness while driving. This physical impairment caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2 (2005 Toyota Highlander SUV), which then pushed V2 into the rear of V3 (2005 Toyota 4-Runner SUV). Although V2 was stopped ahead of V1, the critical reason for V2's involvement in the crash was not assigned, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible.
