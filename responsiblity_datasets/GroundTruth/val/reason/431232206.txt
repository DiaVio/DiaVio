The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to execute a left turn from the northbound left turn lane, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2008 Nissan Maxima, which was traveling southbound in the far right straight lane. V1 entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 and V2 rotated and side-slapped each other after the initial impact, indicating that V1 was still in the path of V2's travel at the time of the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and enter the intersection safely makes it primarily responsible for the crash.
