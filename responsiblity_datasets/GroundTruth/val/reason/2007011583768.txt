The driver of V1 admitted to not noticing the red light and being distracted by her food. She attempted to pass through the intersection while accelerating, disregarding the traffic signal. These actions demonstrate a clear violation of traffic laws and a lack of attention to the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to her failure to stop for the red light. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was following the traffic laws, going straight at a constant speed with a green light. She stated that she did not see V1 until the impact occurred, indicating that she had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to stop for a red light, distraction, and unfamiliarity with the roadway.
