The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost consciousness while driving, which was caused by a heart attack or other physical impairment. This impairment led to V1 departing the end of the T-intersection and subsequently colliding with various objects. The driver's medical condition and the fact that he was taking medications that caused him to pass out behind the wheel indicate that he was not in a condition to safely operate the vehicle.
