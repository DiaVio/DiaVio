The reason for Vehicle #1 being primarily responsible is that it crossed into the westbound lane and struck Vehicle #2 head-on. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a driver error. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 provided false contact information to the police and could not be located for an interview, suggesting a lack of responsibility and accountability.
