The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a medical condition (a stroke) while driving, which caused him to lose control of his vehicle. The driver stated that he felt as though he was not in control of his vehicle whatsoever. This is supported by the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was "this vehicle traveling - re-entered roadway" due to the driver's physical impairment. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Mercedes S430) was cautious and noticed the odd behavior and movement of V1. She tried to steer away from V1 but was still hit on the right side of her car. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
