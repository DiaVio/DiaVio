The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a physical impairment of the ability to act, specifically losing consciousness while driving. This impairment led to V1 traveling off the edge of the road and colliding with V2. The driver's medical conditions and the act of conversing with a passenger prior to the crash were the only associated factors coded to V1.
