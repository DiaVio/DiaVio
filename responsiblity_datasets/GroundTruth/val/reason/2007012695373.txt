The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the wet roadway. This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event and Critical Reason stated in the police report. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, driving without a license, and stealing his mother's car further contribute to his responsibility for the accident. The fact that he was worrying about his court date and taking medications for ADHD and schizophrenia/bipolar disorder may have also impaired his judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle.
