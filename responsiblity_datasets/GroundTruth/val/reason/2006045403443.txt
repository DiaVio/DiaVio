The reason for this is that V2, without signaling or braking, moved into lane two where its left front struck the right rear of V1. This caused V2 to lose control and skid across multiple lanes of traffic before ultimately crashing into a ditch. The witness statement supports this, as they did not see V2 brake or signal and did not see any other reason for V2 to veer into the back of V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to misjudging the velocity of V1 and looking to the rear as he attempted to change lanes. These factors indicate that V2 was not paying proper attention to the road and made an error in judgment, resulting in the collision.
