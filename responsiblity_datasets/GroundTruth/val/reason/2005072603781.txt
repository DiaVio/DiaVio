The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2, which was stopped in traffic. - V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and collided with the back of V2. - The police report indicated that V1 may have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, which could have impaired their ability to react and avoid the collision. - There was no indication of any avoidance actions taken by V1, suggesting a lack of attention or negligence on their part. Overall, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance, potential impairment, and lack of avoidance actions make them primarily responsible for the crash.
