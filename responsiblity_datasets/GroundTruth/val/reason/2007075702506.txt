The driver of V1 veered to the right and rubbed against the north curb, indicating a lack of proper control of the vehicle. The driver then overcorrected by steering right, leading to the skidding and departure from the roadway. The fact that the driver left the scene before the police arrived also suggests a lack of responsibility. Additionally, the driver reported being tired and having personal concerns, which could have contributed to her distraction and impaired judgment. The minimal tread depth and underinflated tire on V1, along with the evidence of full ABS brake lockup, indicate that the vehicle was likely traveling above the posted speed limit. Overall, the driver's lack of control, distraction, and potential speeding make her primarily responsible for the accident.
