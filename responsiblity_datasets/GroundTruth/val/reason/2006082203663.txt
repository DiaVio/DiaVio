The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the entrance ramp. This is evident from the fact that V1 began to rotate clockwise and lost control, ultimately colliding with the jersey barriers multiple times before being struck by V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he was traveling at a speed of 64-72 kmph (40-45 mph), which exceeds the advisory speed of 48 kmph (30 mph) for the roadway. This further supports the conclusion that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, contributing to the loss of control and subsequent crash. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other; not involved in first harmful event," indicating that V2 was not directly involved in causing the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the entrance ramp.
