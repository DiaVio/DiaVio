The driver of V1 was distracted and failed to look ahead, causing him to not realize that V2 had slowed down. This distraction, along with the fact that he was running late for school, contributed to his failure to exercise caution and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him. While V2 (the 2008 Chevy Malibu) was slowing down almost to a complete stop, the critical reason for the crash was not coded to this vehicle. However, it is mentioned that the driver of V2 was fatigued, which may have affected his ability to react to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance, while V2's fatigue may have been a contributing factor.
