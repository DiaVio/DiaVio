The reason for this is that V2 stated that a car turned in front of her at the intersection, indicating that V2 had the right of way. However, V2 was unable to avoid the crash by steering right and braking. This suggests that V2 failed to exercise proper caution and control of her vehicle, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, V2 was engaged in a conversation with her passenger at the time of the crash, which could have been a distraction and contributed to her inability to avoid the collision.
