The reason for this is that Vehicle One departed the roadway to the left for an unknown reason and subsequently rolled over, resulting in damage to the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection," indicating that the driver of Vehicle One was making a left turn at the intersection. On the other hand, there is no information provided about the actions or involvement of Vehicle Two, other than the fact that the driver was not interviewed and the vehicle contained a cooler of alcohol and empty cans on the floor. Therefore, based on the available information, Vehicle One's departure from the roadway and subsequent rollover suggests that it is primarily responsible for the crash.
