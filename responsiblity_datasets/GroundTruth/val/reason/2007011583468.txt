The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made incorrect evasive actions, which led to the vehicle exiting the roadway and colliding with the center cement barrier. Additionally, the driver's distraction from talking on a cell phone and choosing an inappropriate evasive action/overcompensation contributed to the accident.
