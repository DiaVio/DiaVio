The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that it attempted to change lanes into lane one while negotiating a curve to the right, resulting in a corner side-swipe impact with Vehicle Three (V3). This initial impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and cross over into the opposite lanes of travel. The subsequent impact with Vehicle One (V1) was a result of V2's initial lane change maneuver, further causing V1 to rotate clockwise and resulting in significant damage and injuries to the occupants of V1. Therefore, V2's lane change maneuver and subsequent collision with V3 initiated the chain of events that led to the accident, making V2 primarily responsible.
