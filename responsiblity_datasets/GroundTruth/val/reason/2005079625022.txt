The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event being coded as "inadequate surveillance." This means that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the stationary plaster mixer in the travel lane. This lack of attention and awareness led to the collision. Additionally, the driver's fatigue is considered a factor in this crash. With only 5 hours of sleep the night before and a regular sleep schedule that may not align with typical waking hours, the driver's alertness and ability to react quickly and appropriately may have been compromised. Furthermore, the driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle (having driven it less than five times in the last two months) could have contributed to the driver's inability to handle the situation effectively. Overall, the combination of inadequate surveillance, fatigue, and unfamiliarity with the vehicle makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
