The driver of V2 attempted to make a right turn at the intersection from the middle lane (lane two), which is an illegal maneuver. This resulted in the right side of V2 colliding with the left front of V1 (the driver of the 1997 Infiniti QX4) who was traveling straight in the right lane (lane one). V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroaching from adjacent lane (same direction), over the left lane line," indicating that V2 encroached into V1's lane, causing the collision. Therefore, V2's illegal maneuver and encroachment into V1's lane make them primarily responsible for the accident.
