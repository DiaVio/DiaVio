The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, which resulted in the collision with V2 (the 2001 Jeep Wrangler). The driver of V1 claimed that they did not see V2 approaching because the color of the vehicle blended in with the roadway, but this is considered inadequate surveillance. Additionally, sun glare was mentioned as an associative factor for V1, which may have further impaired their visibility.
