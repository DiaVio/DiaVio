The reason for this is that V2 initiated a left turn at the intersection, which requires the driver to yield to oncoming traffic. V1 (the driver of the Buick LeSabre) was traveling straight through the intersection with the green signal and did not decelerate. V2's failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the front planes of both vehicles making contact in the intersection. Additionally, V2's refusal to be interviewed and being taken into custody suggests that there may have been some form of negligence or wrongdoing on their part, further supporting their primary responsibility for the accident.
