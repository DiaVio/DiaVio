The driver of V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the critical event was a recognition error due to inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 admitted to not looking far enough ahead before making the turn and being distracted by thoughts of what she needed to buy at the store. This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the traffic situation led to the collision with V2 (1979 Chevrolet Malibu). V2, on the other hand, had the right of way as they were traveling straight through the intersection with the green light. The driver of V2 stated that he had a clear view of V1 moving into the left turn lane but she did not stop and continued to turn, leaving him unable to stop in time. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V1 encroached into V2's lane. Therefore, while V2 may have contributed to the crash by not being able to stop in time, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to properly surveil the oncoming traffic and making an unsafe left turn.
