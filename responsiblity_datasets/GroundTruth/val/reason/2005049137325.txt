The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the BMW M3 coupe). V1 believed that V2 was preparing to turn left, and entered the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This false assumption led to V1 crossing the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Although V2 was unable to avoid the collision despite attempting to steer to the right and brake, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making the false assumption and not exercising caution when entering the intersection.
