The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a seizure while driving, which impaired her ability to control the vehicle. Additionally, the driver had multiple pre-existing health conditions and was taking prescription medications, which may have contributed to her seizure. The driver also reported being fatigued and unfamiliar with the roadway, further increasing the likelihood of an accident.
