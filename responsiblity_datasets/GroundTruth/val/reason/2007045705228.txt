The reason for V1's responsibility is that it swung wide to its left, departing from lane one and entering lane two, and then came back into lane one to its right, causing the right side of its trailer to contact the left side of V2 (the 2007 Saturn Ion3). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain its lane and made an improper lane change, resulting in the collision with V2.
