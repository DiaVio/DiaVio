The driver of V1 attempted to pass V3 (the 1992 Chevrolet Pick up) in a no-pass zone, which is a violation of traffic laws. This action caused V1 to change into the oncoming traffic lane and collide with V2 (the 2002 Honda Civic) traveling in the opposite direction. The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not observe the no-passing zone sign, despite being familiar with the area and the roadway. This lack of surveillance and violation of traffic laws led to the collision.
