The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was experiencing a physical impairment due to her ongoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer. This impairment caused her to feel ill and lose consciousness while attempting to pull off the road. As a result, V1 traveled off the roadway and collided with an embankment. The driver's physical impairment and loss of consciousness prevented her from taking any avoidance maneuvers, further contributing to the crash.
