The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the case vehicle crossed the center-line into the northbound travel lane, departed the road, and ultimately struck a large tree on the roadside. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
