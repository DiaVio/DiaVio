The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the wrong direction on the eastbound roadway, approaching the intersection. V1 turned right in the intersection, which is not the correct direction of travel, and collided with V2 (the 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix) that was northbound and approaching the intersection. This indicates that V1 was not following the proper traffic rules and regulations, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the occupants of V1 left the scene prior to police arrival, which further suggests their potential responsibility for the accident.
