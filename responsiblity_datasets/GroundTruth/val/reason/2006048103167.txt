The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the curve, as indicated by the police reported travel speed of 80 kmph (exceeding the posted speed limit of 72 kmph) and the critical reason for the crash being coded as "driver related error, too fast for curve." Additionally, the driver of V1 had impaired vision and poor health, including severe diabetes and being legally blind, which were considered contributing factors in the crash.
