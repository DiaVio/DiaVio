The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to taking medication that should not be taken when driving. She also stated that she thought she could make it to her destination before the medication "kicked in." However, she blacked out while driving, resulting in the collision with V2 (legally parked vehicle) and subsequently pushing V2 and V3 (another legally parked vehicle) onto the sidewalk. The driver's decision to drive while under the influence of medication, especially knowing that it could cause impairment, is a clear violation of traffic laws and responsible driving practices. Her blacking out while driving further confirms her inability to safely operate the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
