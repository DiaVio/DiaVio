The driver of V1, an unlicensed 14-year-old male, was driving aggressively by swerving and speeding up and down the road. He failed to stop for a stop sign and lost control of the vehicle. The witness also confirmed V1's aggressive driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced and overcompensated, leading to insufficient steering. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's aggressive driving, failure to stop for a traffic control device, and lack of experience in handling the vehicle.
