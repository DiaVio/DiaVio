The reason for this is that V1's driver exhibited poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being coded as "failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected." Additionally, the driver was inexperienced, traveling too fast due to being late for work, and overcompensated after the non-contact vehicle passed by. These factors contributed to V1 departing the lane, crossing over the right lane, and ultimately colliding with a wall, fence, and house.
