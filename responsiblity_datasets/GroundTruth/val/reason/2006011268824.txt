The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was tailgating, traveling at a speed of 75-80 mph and following 1-2 car lengths behind the vehicle in front of him. This aggressive driving behavior increases the risk of accidents and reduces the driver's ability to react in time to unexpected situations. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to switch lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so, as the vehicle in front of him also began to move to lane one without activating the turn signal. This lack of caution and failure to properly check for other vehicles in the vicinity contributed to the crash. Furthermore, the case summary mentions that V1 had low tread on its tires, which could have affected the vehicle's traction and handling, making it more difficult for the driver to control the vehicle during the swerving maneuvers. Lastly, the driver of V1 had only 11 months of experience driving a pick-up truck, which suggests a lack of experience and potentially inadequate skills in handling such a vehicle at high speeds. Overall, the combination of aggressive driving, failure to maintain a safe following distance, improper lane change, low tire tread, and limited driving experience makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
