The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was merging into the left turn lane without adequately surveilling the area. The driver of V1 stated that he looked in his rearview mirrors and even leaned over to look to the left rear to check for any vehicles in the left turn lane before merging. However, he failed to see Vehicle #2 (V2) approaching from behind and collided with it. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area, which may have contributed to his inadequate surveillance. The weather conditions, specifically the rain, could have also affected visibility and made it more difficult for the driver of V1 to see approaching vehicles. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (V2) was encroached upon by V1, but the driver of V2 was not found to have any critical reasons or associated factors contributing to the accident. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the collision.
