The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was the vehicle involved in the crash and sustained damage from multiple impacts with trees. The description of the events indicates that Vehicle 1 departed the roadway and rotated counterclockwise before impacting a large diameter tree, causing moderate damage. This initial impact then caused Vehicle 1 to spin clockwise and collide with additional trees, resulting in minor damage. Vehicle 1 ultimately came to rest off the west pavement edge. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the damage sustained by Vehicle 1, it can be concluded that Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
