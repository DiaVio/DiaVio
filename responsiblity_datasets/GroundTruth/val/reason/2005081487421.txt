The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make an illegal U-turn in the middle of the roadway. V1 failed to properly check his rearview mirror before making the maneuver, indicating inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V1 was unfamiliar with the road and was distracted by looking at forward traffic after realizing he missed his turn. These factors combined led to V1 turning left in front of V2, causing the collision.
