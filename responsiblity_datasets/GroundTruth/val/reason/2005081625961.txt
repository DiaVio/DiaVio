The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which caused the vehicle to slide off the right side of the roadway and ultimately collide with a tree. The lack of acceleration or braking marks on the roadway suggests that the driver did not take appropriate measures to slow down or control the vehicle while making the left turn.
