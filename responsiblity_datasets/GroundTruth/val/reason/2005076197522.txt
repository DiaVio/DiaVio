The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 departed the roadway to the left and contacted the guardrail with its left side, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. - V1 then steered to the right, entered a clockwise yaw, and crossed the right side of the road, suggesting a loss of control. - V1 tripped over on the unpaved shoulder, rolled multiple times, and struck the embankment, indicating a lack of proper vehicle handling. - The critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling: off the edge of the road on the left side" and the critical reason was coded as "Driver related factor: sleeping, that is actually asleep", suggesting that the driver was fatigued and possibly asleep at the time of the crash. - The medical report indicates the presence of illegal drugs and a blood alcohol level of .01, further indicating impaired driving. Overall, V1's driver's fatigue, possible drug use, and impaired driving contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
