The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of the vehicle in front (V2) and failed to realize that it was stopped. This indicates a driver-related factor, specifically a misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed. V1 was traveling behind V2 and locked up its brakes, skidding into the rear of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
