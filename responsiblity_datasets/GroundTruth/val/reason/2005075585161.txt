The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of approximately 80 kmph (50 mph) in a 48 kmph (30 mph) speed limit zone. This indicates that the driver was exceeding the speed limit, making it difficult for her to respond to unexpected actions, such as the presence of an animal in the roadway. Additionally, the driver's fatigue from playing golf for five hours and working more than forty-eight hours in the last seven days further impaired her ability to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed and fatigue, which hindered her ability to respond to the unexpected presence of an animal in the roadway.
