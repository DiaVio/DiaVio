The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn onto the roadway from a private drive, crossing the path of the oncoming Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2005 Toyota Sienna minivan. V1 was traveling in the inside northbound lane and had the right of way. V2 failed to yield to V1, resulting in the front-left corner of V1 striking the left side of the trailer unit. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
