The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn across the path of V2 (the 1997 Mercury Tracer) without yielding the right-of-way. V1 stated that a large SUV in the second southbound lane was obstructing his view of V2, but he did not attempt any evasive maneuvers and did not see V2 until impact. This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and made an unsafe left turn, resulting in the collision with V2.
