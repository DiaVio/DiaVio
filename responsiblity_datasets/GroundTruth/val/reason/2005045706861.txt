The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 made an "Other decision error - turned with obstructed view" due to the proximity of the tractor-trailer in front of him. This obstructed his view of the traffic light, causing him to turn left at the intersection when the southbound side had a solid green signal. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was conversing with his passengers and focused on the tractor-trailer, further contributing to the decision error. The driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle and the fact that he was driving for one of the passengers who was uncomfortable driving on the interstate also played a role in the obstructed view and decision error.
