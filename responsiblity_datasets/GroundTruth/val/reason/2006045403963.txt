The driver of V1 made a decision error by accelerating to pass a non-contact vehicle while entering a curve. This decision, combined with the fact that the trailer was awkwardly loaded with excess length hanging off the back, caused the trailer to swing and contact the back of V1. The driver of V1 failed to regain control of the vehicle, resulting in a jackknife event and ultimately causing V1 to depart the roadway. The driver's discomfort with the load was also a contributing factor.
