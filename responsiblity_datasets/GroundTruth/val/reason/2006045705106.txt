The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. - V1 misjudged the gap and assumed he had enough time to make the turn, indicating a misjudgment of the situation. - V1 was distracted and inattentive due to his mind being preoccupied with his sister's predicament, which contributed to his failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic. - V1 was an inexperienced driver, which may have affected his ability to accurately judge the timing and distance of oncoming vehicles. - Additionally, V1's vehicle had low tread tires and a transmission issue, which could have potentially affected the vehicle's performance and handling. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
