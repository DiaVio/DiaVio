The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of approximately 64 kmph (40 mph) as it approached the intersection, which is above the speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) on the main roadway. Additionally, the witness stated that V1 turned abruptly without slowing down, indicating a driver-related decision error of going too fast for the curve/turn. This resulted in V1 losing traction and crossing the double-yellow stripe of the side street, ultimately colliding with V2 (the Toyota Corolla). On the other hand, V2 (the Toyota Corolla) was stopped at the T-intersection, waiting at a stop sign for the opportunity to turn left into southbound traffic. The critical precrash event for V2 was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision to turn at a high speed and losing control of the vehicle.
