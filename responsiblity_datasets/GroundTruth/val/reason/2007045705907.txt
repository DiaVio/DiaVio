The reason for this is that V1, the 1988 Nissan 4x4 pickup, drifted left into the center turn lane and traveled through the intersection, ultimately striking V2, the 1999 Dodge Dakota pickup. V1's driver was in diabetic shock at the time of the crash, which impaired their ability to act and control the vehicle. Additionally, V1 had a tire deficiency with low tread on oversized tires. These factors indicate that V1's driver was not able to maintain proper control of the vehicle, leading to the collision.
