The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was emotionally upset and distracted, which was a driver-related factor. The driver was looking to the left at a field and failed to notice the stopped vehicle (V2) in the lane ahead. Despite the wet road conditions, it is likely that V1 would have still collided with V2 even if the roadway had been dry. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) but was not taking medication, which may have further contributed to the driver's distraction and inattentiveness. Factors such as unfamiliarity with the vehicle, driver inexperience, and wet roads were also associated with V1.
