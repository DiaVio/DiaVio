The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, resulting in a series of events that led to the crash. The vehicle skidded across all three northbound lanes, struck the concrete median barrier twice, spilled oil across the lanes, and ultimately went off the right edge of the roadway, hitting a small tree and coming to rest facing north. Although the exact cause of the driver losing control is unknown, evidence in the vehicle indicated that the driver had been drinking intoxicants, and it is believed to be a factor in the crash. However, since the driver could not be located or interviewed, and the police accident report could not be obtained, the critical reason for the critical event is coded as unknown driver error.
