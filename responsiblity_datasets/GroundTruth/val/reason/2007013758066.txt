The reason for V1's responsibility is that the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded for V1 is "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the roadway to the right side" and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded for V1 is "Driver related, Overcompensation". This indicates that V1 veered off the roadway to the right side, suggesting that the driver overcorrected or made an excessive steering input, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the witness statement mentioned that there were no other cars around V1 when it left the roadway, contradicting V1's claim that another car swerved into her lane and forced her off the roadway. While V1's medical conditions and medication use are mentioned, there is no direct evidence linking them to the cause of the crash. The negative alcohol test also contradicts the police report stating that V1 was positive for alcohol. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to overcompensation while traveling off the roadway to the right side.
