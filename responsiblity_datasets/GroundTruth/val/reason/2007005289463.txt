The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and drift into the opposing lane before leaving the roadway. The driver himself stated that he had no recollection of what happened and woke up in the woods against a tree. The medical report also confirms that he was found unconscious by EMS about an hour after the crash. Therefore, the driver's physical impairment, likely due to a heart attack, is the primary reason for the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
