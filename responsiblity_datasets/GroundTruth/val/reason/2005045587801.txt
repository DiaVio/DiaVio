The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to turn left onto the residential road without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver falsely assumed that Vehicle #2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina) was stopping at the intersection, leading to a collision between the two vehicles. This decision error and false assumption of the other vehicle's actions contributed to the crash. On the other hand, there were no associated factors coded for Vehicle #2 that contributed to the crash. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that the other vehicle turned left in front of her and she could not avoid the collision, indicating that she was not primarily responsible for the crash.
