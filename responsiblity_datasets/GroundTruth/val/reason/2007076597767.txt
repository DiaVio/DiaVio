The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to turn left from a business driveway. This misjudgment led to V1 pulling out into the eastbound lane and being impacted by V2. Although V2 changed lanes to the #2 lane in an attempt to avoid V1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to accurately assess the situation and safely execute the left turn.
