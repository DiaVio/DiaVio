The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way at the intersection and crossed the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1997 Ford F-150 4x4 pickup truck), resulting in the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 1's subsequent rotation and rollover were a direct result of the initial impact, indicating a loss of control by the driver of Vehicle 1.
