The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to see Vehicle two (V2 - the 1987 Chevrolet V10) approaching when making a left turn. V1 was signaling a left turn and began to cross the right northbound lane without properly checking for oncoming traffic. This failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision between V1 and V2.
