The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal factor, specifically playing with a stress ball and dropping it on the floor. This distraction caused the driver to lean down and take their eyes off the road, resulting in a failure to notice that V2 (the TMC metro bus) was decelerating to stop at the bus stop. As a result, V1's vehicle collided with the back of V2. While V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in same direction with higher speed," it is important to note that the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver-related factor of internal distraction.
