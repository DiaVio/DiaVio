The driver of V1 stated that he stopped at the stop sign and waited for traffic to clear before proceeding to make a left-hand turn onto the five-lane roadway. However, he failed to see V2 (the 2002 Chrysler Sebring) approaching in the second lane, resulting in the front bumper of V1 contacting the front right fender of V2. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling and turning left at an intersection, while the Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded for V1 is "failed to look - looked but did not see." This suggests that V1's failure to properly observe and perceive the approaching vehicle in the second lane was a contributing factor to the crash.
