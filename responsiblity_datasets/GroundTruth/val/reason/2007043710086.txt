Reason: V2 was making a left turn across the westbound lane, and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 claimed to have looked but did not see V1 approaching, indicating an error in surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V2 had recent cataract surgery and claimed to not need glasses anymore, which may have affected their ability to see oncoming vehicles. The driver's possible distraction from talking with their great-grandson in the front passenger seat could have further contributed to the inadequate surveillance.
