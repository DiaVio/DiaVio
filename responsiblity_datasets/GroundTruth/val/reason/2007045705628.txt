The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and departed the right side of the road multiple times. The driver's action of reaching for his hat in the right side door pocket caused him to lose focus and overcompensate, leading to the vehicle crossing into the westbound lane and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, the driver's excessive speed of 89kph/55mph in a 64kph/40mph zone, combined with his inexperience and poor directional control, contributed to the crash.
