The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver drifted to the left on a right-hand curve on wet pavement, initiating contact with the paved shoulder. Instead of making a slight correction to the right to return to the left travel lane, the driver overcompensated, causing V1 to rotate clockwise and ultimately lose control. This performance error of overcompensation led to the crash.
