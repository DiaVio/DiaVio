The reason for this is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, specifically failing to notice the large elk crossing the roadway. This is evident from the driver's statement that she saw something crossing the roadway in the distance but did not take appropriate action to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the animal crossing problem on this road and her tiredness (having slept only 3 hours) may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and inability to react in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance.
