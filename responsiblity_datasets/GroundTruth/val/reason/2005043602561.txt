The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Dodge Neon, struck the back of V1, the Saturn SC1, while V1 was stopped in the eastbound lane waiting to turn left into her driveway. V2's Critical Precrash Event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane stopped" and the Critical Reason was coded as "inattention." Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned that everything happened so fast that she cannot recall exactly what happened, indicating a lack of attention and awareness on her part. Furthermore, the environmental contributing factor of sun glare was mentioned, but it is important to note that all other vehicles on the road were driving at the same speed and did not collide with V1. This suggests that V2's inattention and failure to stop in time were the primary causes of the accident. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inattention and failure to stop in time.
