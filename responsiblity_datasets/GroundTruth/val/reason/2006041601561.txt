The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn across the westbound traffic lanes without adequately surveilling the oncoming vehicles. This recognition error led to the collision with V2 (the Toyota Camry). V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic caused the initial impact and subsequent sideslip between the two vehicles. Therefore, V1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
