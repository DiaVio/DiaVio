The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they had a red light but proceeded to make a right turn in front of V2 (the Ford dump truck). V1's failure to properly observe the traffic signal and check for oncoming traffic before making the turn led to the collision. V2, on the other hand, attempted to avoid the collision by steering left and locking up the brakes, indicating that they took appropriate evasive action. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. In summary, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and properly assess the situation before making the right turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
