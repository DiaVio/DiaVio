The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed over the right lane line before completely passing V2 (the 1997 Ford/Thomas CBE school bus). This indicates poor directional control on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to feeling drowsy and being fatigued before the crash, which suggests that driver fatigue played a significant role in the crash. V2, on the other hand, was driving in their lane and had no chance to take evasive action. The driver of V2 saw V1 coming up behind her on her left and passing her, but V1 cut into her lane before completely passing. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the crash.
