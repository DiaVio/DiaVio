The reason for this is that V1, the Lexus GX470 SUV, failed to yield and turned left into the path of V2, the Isuzu Rodeo SUV, which was approaching the intersection from the opposite direction. V2 was traveling straight and had the right of way. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated the travel and impact speeds of V1 to be 24 kmph (15 mph), while V2 estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 72 kmph (45 mph). This indicates that V1 was traveling at a significantly slower speed compared to V2, further suggesting that V1 failed to properly judge the distance and speed of oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and turn left into the path of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
