The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2, with only 4.6 meters (15 feet) of distance between them. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance, which is a driver decision error. As a result, when V2 suddenly stopped, V1 was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level of 0.164%. This further contributes to V1's responsibility for the accident, as driving under the influence impairs judgment, reaction time, and overall driving ability. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and driving under the influence of alcohol.
