The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver was operating the vehicle at the time of the accident and was involved in a right side leading rollover, which ultimately resulted in the driver's fatal injuries. The severity of the vehicle damage, as rated as 'severe' based on crush, suggests that the driver was likely driving at a high speed or in a reckless manner, leading to the rollover and subsequent impact with the wooden utility pole. Additionally, the fact that the frontal impact airbags did not deploy indicates that the driver may have been involved in a collision or maneuver that did not trigger the airbag deployment system. Overall, the driver's actions and the resulting injuries indicate that V1, the 2002 Ford Explorer, is primarily responsible for the accident.
