The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it veered off the north edge of the roadway, rotated counterclockwise, and then departed the roadway to the right. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the subsequent impacts with trees and the severe injuries sustained by the driver. Additionally, the fact that the driver was unrestrained further contributes to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
