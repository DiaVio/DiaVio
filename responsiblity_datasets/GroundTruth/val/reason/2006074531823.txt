The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle three, a seventeen-year-old male, was distracted by conversing with his friends and looking at the right front seat passenger. He failed to realize that caution was required due to the heavy rush hour traffic and did not look far enough ahead. As a result, he was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of Vehicle two, which then caused Vehicle two to collide with the back of Vehicle one. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle three's internal distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead led to the chain reaction crash, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
