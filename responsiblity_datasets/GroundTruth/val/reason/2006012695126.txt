The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately survey the road before making a left turn. She stated that she did not see any vehicles in lane two and attempted to turn left, not realizing that V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Impala) was approaching in that lane. V1's failure to properly assess the traffic conditions and ensure it was safe to make the turn led to the collision with V2.
