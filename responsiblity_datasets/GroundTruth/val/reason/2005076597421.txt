The reason for this is that V1 crossed the centerline, exited the left side road edge, and rode the left shoulder before attempting to steer back onto the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, V1 rotated clockwise and counter clockwise before ultimately rolling over and colliding with a large tree. This suggests that the driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle and prevent the rollover. While the exact cause of the driver's error is unknown, it is clear that V1's driver made multiple mistakes that led to the accident. These include crossing the centerline, failing to maintain control of the vehicle, and ultimately veering off the road and colliding with a tree.
