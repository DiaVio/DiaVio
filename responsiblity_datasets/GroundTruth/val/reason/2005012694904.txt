The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and did not react in time to avoid a collision. V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to anticipate the slowing down of V2 contributed to the crash. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway and external distraction (looking for trains) further impaired their ability to react appropriately. While V2 (the driver of the 2001 Chevrolet Lumina) may have been traveling at a higher speed, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and react in a timely manner ultimately led to the collision.
