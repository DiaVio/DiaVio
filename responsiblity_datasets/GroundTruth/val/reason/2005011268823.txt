The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of approximately 60-65 mph, which was too fast for the wet conditions. This decision to drive at an excessive speed for the road conditions led to V1 hydroplaning and losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's decision to change lanes in the wet conditions further contributed to the loss of control.
