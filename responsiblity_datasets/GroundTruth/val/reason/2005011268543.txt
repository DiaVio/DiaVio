The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 22-year old pregnant female, failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead (V2) and collided with its rear. This initial collision then caused a chain reaction, with V2 being pushed into the rear of V3, and subsequent vehicles (Toyota Camry and Dodge Caravan) colliding with the rear of V1. Although rush hour congestion was a contributing factor, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver of V1 to maintain a safe distance and avoid colliding with the vehicle ahead.
