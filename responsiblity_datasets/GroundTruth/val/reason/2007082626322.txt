The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway multiple times, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the collision and tested positive for a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level. The driver's age and the presence of multiple medications may have also contributed to impaired driving ability.
