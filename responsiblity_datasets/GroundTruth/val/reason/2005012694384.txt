The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the traffic in lane 1 of the westbound roadway before making the left turn. This is evident from the fact that V1's front right made contact with the front left of V2. Additionally, V1's driver admitted to not stopping to check traffic in lane 1 due to the construction and being focused on the restaurant he intended to dine at. These factors indicate that V1's driver did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
