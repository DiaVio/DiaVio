The reason for V1's primary responsibility is due to the driver's aggressive driving behavior, which included speeding and changing lanes prior to the crash. This behavior indicates a lack of caution and disregard for the safety of other road users. V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and adjust their driving behavior to the congested traffic flow ultimately led to the rear-end collision with V2.
