The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change into lane 3 while the traffic was slowing down ahead. In doing so, V1's front impacted the left rear corner of V2 (the Chevrolet Tahoe) in the same lane. V1 then continued into the third lane and its front impacted the right side of V3 (the Nissan Altima). V1 did not stop after the collision and continued to drive south, indicating a failure to take responsibility for the accident. V2, on the other hand, followed V1 without stopping initially but later returned to the scene. Therefore, V1's actions of attempting to change lanes without proper caution and causing multiple impacts with other vehicles make them primarily responsible for the crash.
