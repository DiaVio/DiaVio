The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through it. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason for this event was inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). This indicates that V2 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic before entering the intersection. Additionally, an associated factor coded to V2 was a recognition factor, indicating that V2 looked but did not see the approaching vehicle (V1). This further supports the conclusion that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the presence of V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the intersection and properly observe the oncoming traffic.
