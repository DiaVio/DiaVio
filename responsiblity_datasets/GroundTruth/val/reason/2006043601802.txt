The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and drove off the right side of the road, ultimately colliding with trees. Despite claiming that the steering system locked up, the driver's history of previous crashes and the fact that the EDR information could not be downloaded raise doubts about the credibility of this claim. Additionally, the driver's incorrect evasive action of trying to steer left to avoid the squirrel instead of driving over it contributed to the accident. This demonstrates a lack of proper judgment and decision-making skills on the part of the driver. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, history of previous crashes, and incorrect evasive action.
