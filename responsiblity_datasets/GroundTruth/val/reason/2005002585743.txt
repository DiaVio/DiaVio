The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which caused the vehicle to drift off the roadway. This critical non-performance error of falling asleep while driving is the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, there were no indications of any avoidance maneuvers made by the driver to prevent the crash.
