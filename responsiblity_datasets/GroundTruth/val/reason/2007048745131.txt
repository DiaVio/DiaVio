The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she proceeded through the intersection with an obstructed view. She stated that she did not see V2 due to the presence of a truck in eastbound lane three. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that the intersection was clear before entering it. As a result, V1's actions directly contributed to the collision with V2.
