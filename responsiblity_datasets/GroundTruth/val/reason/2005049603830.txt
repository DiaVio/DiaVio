The reason for this is that V1 drove off the road to the left, sideswiped a wooden fence, impacted a utility pole, and ultimately rolled over onto its roof. The critical reason for the crash was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically "inattention." It is mentioned that the driver had been thinking about an upcoming amputation and started to feel sick at the store, which suggests that the driver's lack of attention and focus on the road contributed to the crash.
