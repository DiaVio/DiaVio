The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for the event was coded as "misjudgment of gap or other's speed." Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V2 is an 18-year-old male who does not possess a valid driver's license and has been driving for less than a year. This driver's inexperience is identified as an associated factor in the crash. Therefore, V2's misjudgment of the gap or speed of V1, combined with the driver's inexperience, makes V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
