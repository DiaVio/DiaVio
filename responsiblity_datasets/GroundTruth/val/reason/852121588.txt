The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, the 1996 Ford F250 pickup truck, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to V2 and turned in front of it, resulting in the collision.
