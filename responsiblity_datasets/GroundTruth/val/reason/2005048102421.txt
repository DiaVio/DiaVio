The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to avoid a collision with a deer that ran into the roadway. The driver fully applied the ABS and steered right, but the vehicle departed the right road edge and struck a power pole. This indicates poor directional control, which ultimately led to the crash.
