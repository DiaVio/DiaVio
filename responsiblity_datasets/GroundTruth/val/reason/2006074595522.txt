The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice the traffic signals and did not yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1997 Chevrolet Lumina) who was already in the intersection. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway and the distraction of looking for an address contributed to the driver's illegal maneuver and failure to brake in time to avoid the collision.
