The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to leave the slip ramp and re-enter the through lanes by traveling across a grassy gore area. This action caused V1 to lose control, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw and ultimately rolling onto its side. As V1 rolled, it re-entered the right northbound lane and collided with the front of Vehicle Two (V2). This indicates that V1's improper maneuver and loss of control directly led to the collision.
