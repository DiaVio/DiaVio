The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by dropping a water bottle and looking down to pick it up. As a result, he failed to notice that the traffic ahead had stopped, leading to the collision with the rear of V2 (the 1992 Chevrolet G-20 utility full-size van). The driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road are the main reasons for assigning primary responsibility to V1.
