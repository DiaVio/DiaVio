The driver of Vehicle #1 swerved left to avoid a non-contact vehicle traveling eastbound in the westbound lane, but then continued traveling west in the eastbound lane before departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree. The critical reason for this pre-crash event was a performance error, specifically poor directional control following the avoidance maneuver with the non-contact vehicle. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 reported that her view of eastbound traffic was obstructed by dense shrubbery on the left roadside, which could have contributed to the poor decision-making and subsequent crash. It is important to note that the driver of Vehicle #1 also mentioned taking two prescription medications, one for thyroid replacement and the other for high blood pressure. While this information is provided, it is not explicitly stated whether these medications played a role in the crash. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver's performance error and the sightline restriction caused by the shrubbery.
