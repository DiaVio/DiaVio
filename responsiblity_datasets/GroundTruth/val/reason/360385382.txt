The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to avoid colliding with V2, the 2002 Oldsmobile Alero four-door sedan, which was stopped and facing northeast in lane three. Despite having clear weather conditions, dry travel lanes, and overhead street lights, the driver of V1 was unable to steer or brake effectively to avoid the collision. This resulted in the front of V1 impacting the back of V2, causing V2 to rotate clockwise and come to a rest in the center of the freeway lanes. The fact that V1's driver's frontal airbag deployed and the seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated indicates a significant impact, suggesting that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too high for the conditions or failed to maintain a safe distance from V2. The serious injuries sustained by the 66-year-old female driver of V1 further support the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
