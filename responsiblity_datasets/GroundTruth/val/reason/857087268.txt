The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid an unknown vehicle encroaching into the southbound travel lane. This action caused Vehicle 1 to depart the roadway and sideswipe a tree. The driver then lost control while trying to regain the initial travel lane, oversteering and compensating by steering right again. This resulted in Vehicle 1 departing the roadway for a second time, climbing a small embankment, and ultimately striking a tree head-on. The driver of Vehicle 1 likely failed to maintain control of the vehicle and overreacted to the presence of the unknown vehicle, leading to the subsequent loss of control and the collision with the tree.
