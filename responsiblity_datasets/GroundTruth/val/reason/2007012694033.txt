The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being inattentive and not noticing the vehicle stopped in front of her until it was too late to stop. She stated that she was thinking about stopping at another store and had checked the lane to her right before attempting to merge into lane 1. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness of her surroundings, which led to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattentiveness and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
