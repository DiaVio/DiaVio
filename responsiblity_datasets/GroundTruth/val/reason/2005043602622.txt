The driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive speed of 137 kmph (85 mph), which was well above the speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). This high speed made it difficult for the driver to safely change lanes and react to the traffic conditions. Additionally, the driver was not wearing his prescribed lenses, which impaired his vision and contributed to inadequate surveillance when he failed to look in lane two before attempting to merge. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, due to frustration with the slower vehicle in front of him, further compromised his ability to safely maneuver the vehicle. Lastly, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway also played a role in the crash.
