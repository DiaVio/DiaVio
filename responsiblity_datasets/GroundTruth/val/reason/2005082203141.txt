The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was experiencing a panic attack and was in a hurry to get away from a friend who was making her uncomfortable. She was not clothed from the waist down and believed she was going into a seizure. Additionally, her blood alcohol level was extremely high at 0.414, and she admitted to consuming a pint of hard liquor daily. The combination of alcohol consumption, medication (which can cause drowsiness), and her heightened emotional state due to the panic attack likely impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's impaired condition and failure to take any avoidance actions despite being aware of V2's presence.
