The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver-related factor of a "critical non-performance error heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act." The driver of V1 stated that she doesn't remember anything until V1 hit the tree, indicating a lapse in consciousness or impairment. Although she didn't appear unconscious or asleep to witnesses, her statement and the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side suggest a physical impairment that led to the accident. Additionally, the medication the driver of V1 was taking, a beta-blocker with possible side effects of dizziness, drowsiness, and lightheadedness, could have contributed to her impaired ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's physical impairment and potential medication side effects.
