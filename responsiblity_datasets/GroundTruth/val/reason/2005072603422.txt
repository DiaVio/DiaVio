The driver of V1 failed to stop properly at the stop sign and was distracted by the elevated sewer caps on the road. This indicates a driver recognition error and external distraction as the critical reason for the critical event. Additionally, the witness at the scene stated that V1 was traveling slowly, avoiding the sewer caps. On the other hand, V2 (the blue 1995 Plymouth Voyager) was traveling eastbound and had the right of way. The driver of V2 claimed that V1 was going very fast and did not stop at the stop sign. However, there is no evidence or witness statement to support this claim. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and being distracted by the sewer caps.
