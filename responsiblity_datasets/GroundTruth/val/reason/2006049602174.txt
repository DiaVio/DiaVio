The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he was following too closely behind V2 (the 1997 GMC Suburban SUV) and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision when V2 came to a complete stop. V1 admitted that his wheels locked and his tires screeched before sliding into V2, indicating that he was unable to maintain control of his vehicle and stop safely. Additionally, V1 mentioned that an unidentified vehicle in front of him had moved into lane 2 to avoid a collision with V2. This suggests that there was a warning sign for V1 that V2 might stop, but he failed to react in time to prevent the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and his inability to react in time to the stopped vehicle ahead make him primarily responsible for the accident.
