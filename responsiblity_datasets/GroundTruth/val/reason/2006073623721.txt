The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver went off the right side of the roadway in an attempt to avoid the line of non-contact vehicles that were stopped in the westbound lane. This action resulted in V1 striking two mailboxes and a tree, causing damage to the vehicle and injuries to the driver. The witness stated that the driver locked up the brakes and went off the road, indicating that V1's actions were the cause of the crash. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 stated to the police that he was ill and had blacked out prior to the crash. It is revealed that the driver is an insulin-dependent diabetic and is also taking dialysis. While the driver's health condition may have contributed to his feeling ill and potentially losing consciousness, it does not absolve him of responsibility for the crash. It is the driver's responsibility to ensure that he is fit to drive and to take appropriate measures to manage his health condition while operating a vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions of going off the road and striking the mailboxes and tree, as well as the potential negligence in managing his health condition while driving.
