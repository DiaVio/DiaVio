The driver of V1 failed to stop for traffic and collided with the back of V2 (the 1994 Toyota pickup). This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and did not react in time to the stopped traffic ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by an external factor, which was coded as an associative factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop for traffic, inadequate surveillance, and being an inexperienced driver.
