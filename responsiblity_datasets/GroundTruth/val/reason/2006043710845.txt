The reason for this is that V1 failed to negotiate the curve in the road and continued on a straight path, resulting in the vehicle jumping the right curb and departing the roadway. This indicates a driver error or lack of control on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 fled the scene immediately after the impact raises suspicion and suggests that they may have been aware of their responsibility for the crash. Furthermore, the owner of V1's claim that the vehicle was stolen and his denial of being the driver or knowing who drove the vehicle raises doubts about his credibility and involvement in the incident. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
