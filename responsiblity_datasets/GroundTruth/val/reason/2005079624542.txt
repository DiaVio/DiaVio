The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "Driver related recognition error, Inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic on the main road before turning left, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle 2 (the 1999 Nissan Altima) reported seeing Vehicle 1 enter her lane and applied the brakes but was unable to stop or avoid the collision. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 2 took appropriate evasive action but was unable to prevent the collision due to the sudden appearance of Vehicle 1. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn.
