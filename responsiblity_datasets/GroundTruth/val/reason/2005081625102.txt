The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, ignoring the traffic control device. This is supported by the fact that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance" and "ignoring stop sign". Additionally, V1 had a sight restriction to the left, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to see the oncoming V2. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
