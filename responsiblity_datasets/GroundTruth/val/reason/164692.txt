The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve on icy road conditions. This resulted in V1 departing the road and colliding with a tree stump. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle in hazardous weather conditions indicates negligence on their part, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
