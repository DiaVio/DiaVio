The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the 2003 GMC Yukon Denali), who had the right-of-way. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 approaching, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 made no attempts to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
