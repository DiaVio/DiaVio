The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to the poor road conditions, specifically the snow and slush-covered roadway. The driver mentioned that the snow was getting worse, and despite reducing speed and applying the brakes gently, the vehicle still slid off the roadway and collided with trees. The driver's lack of control over the vehicle in these conditions indicates that V1 was not able to adapt to the road conditions appropriately, making them primarily responsible for the crash.
