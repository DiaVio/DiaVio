The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the other driver's action. The driver of V1 claimed that another vehicle facing the opposite direction gave him the go-ahead to make the left turn. However, this false assumption led to inadequate surveillance as the driver did not notice V2 coming through the intersection. As a result, V1 turned directly in front of V2, causing the collision. V2, on the other hand, had a green signal and was proceeding through the intersection when V1 turned in front of him. Therefore, V2 is not considered to have contributed to the crash and is not primarily responsible.
