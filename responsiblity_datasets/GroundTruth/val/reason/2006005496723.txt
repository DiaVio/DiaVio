The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to stop for the red light at the intersection. The driver of V1 was distracted by conversing on a cell phone and did not notice that the light had changed. This distraction caused them to proceed through the intersection without stopping, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2006 Ford Explorer) had the right of way as they were stopped at a red light and proceeded to make a left turn when the light turned green. However, V2's sightline was restricted due to trees and shrubbery growing on the corner of the intersection. This sightline restriction, along with V1's failure to stop, contributed to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop for the red light, caused by distraction from using a cell phone.
