The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 when pulling out into the intersection. This is evident from the fact that V1 was originally stopped at the stop sign and attempted to turn left onto the arterial road without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. The driver's vision impairment and the sightline restriction from the sign further contributed to the failure to see V2 approaching. Additionally, the decision to turn with an obstructed view was a contributing factor.
