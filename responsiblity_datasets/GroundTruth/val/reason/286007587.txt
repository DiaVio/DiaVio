The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was making a left turn at the intersection onto the westbound road, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the 2001 Mack tractor with one trailer) was traveling east on the eastbound roadway and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to V2, resulting in the initial side impact between the two vehicles (event 1). Additionally, V1's subsequent impacts with the support pole of the house porch (event 2) and the bridge rail of the concrete bridge (event 3) were a result of V1 being pushed by V2. V1's contact with V2's left side (event 4) and left quarter panel (event 5) occurred as a result of V1 being crushed between the wall and V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and subsequent actions leading to multiple impacts make it primarily responsible for the accident.
