The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Toyota Corolla) while crossing the main road from the private driveway. V1's failure to observe V2's approach and the witness statements suggesting that V1 was distracted by a cell phone conversation indicate a driver-related recognition error and internal distraction. While V2 may have been engaged in a cell phone conversation at the time of the crash and was late for a job interview, the critical reason for the collision was attributed to V1's failure to yield and recognize the approaching vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
