The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted while trying to retrieve a fallen object from the front passenger seat. This distraction caused V1 to drift to the right towards a semi truck in lane 1. In an attempt to avoid the truck, the driver overcompensated by jerking the wheel to the left, which ultimately led to V1 veering off the roadway and rolling over in the median. The driver's choice of an inappropriate evasive action and the cargo shift prior to impact also contributed to the accident.
