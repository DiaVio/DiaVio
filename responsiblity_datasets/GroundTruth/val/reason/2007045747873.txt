The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2, causing it to veer into lane two and collide with V3. Additionally, V1 continued to lose control and skidded off the road, ultimately striking a tree. The fact that V1's driver and passenger were both under the influence of intoxicants, with a partially consumed bottle of whiskey visible in the vehicle, suggests impaired driving as a contributing factor. The police report also indicated that the driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was .21, well above the legal limit. Therefore, V1's driver's impaired condition and the decision to travel too fast for the conditions make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
