The reason for Vehicle #1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of the van attempted to pass a slower vehicle and lost control of the vehicle. The driver went off the roadway, overcorrected, and ultimately caused the van to roll over. The interview obtained from a passenger in the van also suggests that there may have been problems with the steering mechanism of the vehicle, which could have contributed to the driver's loss of control. Additionally, the distraction caused by the 3-year-old child dropping her teddy bear out the window and screaming before the crash further supports the driver's responsibility. The distraction likely diverted the driver's attention from completing the passing maneuver safely, leading to the overcorrection and subsequent crash. Therefore, Vehicle #1 (the GMC Van) is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and potential mechanical issues with the vehicle.
