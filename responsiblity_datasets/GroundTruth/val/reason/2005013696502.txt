The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stop at the stop sign before pulling out into the intersection, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1 also exhibited inadequate surveillance as the driver did not see V2 approaching from the left, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. - The driver of V1 reported inattention as an associated factor, possibly due to personal issues, which could have contributed to the inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign, inadequate surveillance, and inattention make them primarily responsible for the crash.
