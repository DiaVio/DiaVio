The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the roadway to the right side in an attempt to avoid a non-contact vehicle making a left turn. This action ultimately led to V1 impacting a tree and causing major damage. Since V1 was the vehicle that left the roadway and collided with the tree, it is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
