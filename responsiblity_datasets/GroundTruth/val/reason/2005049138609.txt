The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that a non-contact vehicle turned across his path from the northbound lanes. However, instead of slowing down or stopping to avoid a collision, the driver of Vehicle #1 accelerated and steered to the right, ultimately losing control of the vehicle. This decision to accelerate and steer to the right, rather than taking evasive action or braking, contributed to Vehicle #1 departing the roadway and colliding with a tree. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to exercise proper control and take appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision.
