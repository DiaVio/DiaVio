The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at street signs while the light turned green and he started to move forward. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that V2 (the Chevrolet Suburban) and V3 (the Ford F150 pickup truck) were still stopped in front of him. As a result, V1 struck the rear of V2, which then pushed V2 into the back of V3. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's external distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of him.
