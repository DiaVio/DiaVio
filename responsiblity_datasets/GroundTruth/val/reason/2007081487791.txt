The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the 1998 Saturn SL1 sedan) and incorrectly believed that she had the right of way to make a left turn. However, a witness refuted this and indicated that V2 had a green light. V1's false assumption and failure to yield the right of way led to the collision.
