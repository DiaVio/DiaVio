The reason for this is that V2 was observed making an illegal maneuver by changing lanes in the intersection. Additionally, V2 was distracted by the city bus ahead, which further contributed to the accident. The analysis of the damage to both vehicles also indicated that V2 was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V1, suggesting that V2 may have been driving too fast for the conditions. Therefore, V2's illegal maneuver, distraction, and higher speed make them primarily responsible for the accident.
