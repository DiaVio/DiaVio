The reason for this is that V1 crossed three lanes of traffic to the left, encroaching into the opposite direction, and ultimately causing the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2001 Buick Century). The critical precrash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a driver error. However, the exact nature of the error is unknown. On the other hand, V2 was not thought to have contributed to the crash and took appropriate avoidance measures. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
