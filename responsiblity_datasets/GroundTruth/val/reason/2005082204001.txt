The driver of V1 stated that a small car had darted in front of his truck, forcing him to slam on the brakes and causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor: too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. This suggests that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too high for the wet road conditions and was unable to react appropriately to the situation.
