The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver overcompensated by steering left to avoid a utility pole, which caused V1 to cross all lanes and ultimately collide with a metal pole/barrier. Furthermore, the fact that the driver of V1 was allegedly intoxicated at the time of the crash suggests impaired judgment and potentially impaired driving ability, which could have contributed to the loss of control and overcompensation. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and potential impairment.
