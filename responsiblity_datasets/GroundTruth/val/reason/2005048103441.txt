The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the southbound roadway, but failed to yield to oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she saw V2 (the 1999 Toyota Camry) but assumed it was turning, when it was actually passing straight through the intersection. This false assumption of the other driver's actions led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was eating and drinking while driving, which could have contributed to a distraction and impaired her ability to accurately assess the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failing to yield the right of way and making a false assumption about the actions of the other driver.
