The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving too fast for the road conditions. It was dark, unlit, and snowing, with very snow-covered roadways. Additionally, the driver's extreme agitation at the scene suggests that she may have been distracted or not fully focused on the road. The fact that V1 was unable to complete the left turn and ended up colliding with a tree further indicates that the driver was not able to maintain control of the vehicle. The mechanical defect of overinflated tires may have also contributed to the loss of control.
