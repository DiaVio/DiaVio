The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling westbound and intended to turn left at the intersection. However, it collided with Vehicle 1, the 2010 Lexus IS 250C, which was traveling eastbound and had the right of way. Vehicle 2's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn resulted in the collision.
