The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for curve/turn." This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the curve and the conditions of the road, resulting in the loss of control and the subsequent rollover. The driver's inexperience and the distraction of talking with his passenger were also associated factors in this crash.
