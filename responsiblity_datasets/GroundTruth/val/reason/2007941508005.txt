The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and took her eyes off the road while reaching for her seatbelt. This distraction caused her to not notice the disabled vehicle (V2) stopped in front of her until it was too late. Additionally, the driver stated that she briefly considered changing lanes but was unable to do so due to another vehicle in that lane. This indicates a lack of proper attention and decision-making on the part of V1's driver. While V2 (the Plymouth Neon) did contribute to the accident by being stopped in the roadway without sufficient fuel, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper awareness of the road ahead.
