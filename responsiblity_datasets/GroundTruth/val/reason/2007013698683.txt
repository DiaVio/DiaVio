The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was stopped in a business driveway waiting to turn left onto the five-lane roadway. - V1 pulled out and started to make its turn without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. - The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded for V1 was "driver related, inadequate surveillance - looked but did not see." - The driver of V1 stated that he stopped and looked both ways but did not see V2. - V1's failure to properly observe and perceive the oncoming V2 resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the crash.
