The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an illegal maneuver by attempting to pass straight through the intersection during the red phase of the traffic signal. This decision to disregard the red light and proceed through the intersection resulted in the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1992 Mercedes 300SE sedan) who was turning left into eastbound traffic. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 absconded from the scene further indicates a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their illegal maneuver and disregard for the traffic signal.
