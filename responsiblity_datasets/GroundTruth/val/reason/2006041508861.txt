The reason for this is that V2 made a right turn at the intersection without yielding to the oncoming traffic, specifically V1, the Chevrolet Silverado pickup. V2 was stopped facing eastbound, and as V1 was traveling northbound, V2 should have waited for V1 to pass before making the right turn. However, V2 failed to do so and collided with the rear of V1. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 was improperly parked at the time of the crash, which further indicates negligence on the part of the driver. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and improper parking.
