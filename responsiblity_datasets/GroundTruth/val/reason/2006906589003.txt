The driver of Vehicle One admitted to not paying full attention while driving. She was distracted by looking at a map for directions, drinking water, and talking to the children. This internal distraction led to a recognition error, causing her to fail to see Vehicle Two (1993 Chevrolet Caprice 4 door sedan) approaching in lane three. Additionally, the wet road conditions may have contributed to the crash. The driver of Vehicle One was not familiar with the roadway, and the consistent drizzle throughout the afternoon and evening made the road surfaces wet. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's internal distraction and failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle Two.
