The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The driver of V1 stated that the sun was in his eyes, but this does not excuse his failure to properly check for oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not stop at the intersection, but only decelerated, indicating a lack of caution. V2 (the driver of the 2002 Chevy Blazer) detected V1 as she approached the intersection but assumed that V1 would yield the right of way. While V2 encroached over the left lane line, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly surveilling the intersection and failing to yield to oncoming traffic. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
