The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was exceeding the posted speed limit by 5 to 8 miles per hour, which indicates a violation of traffic laws and a potential disregard for road safety. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway contributed to the accident, as they were not familiar with the curve and made an incorrect evasive action, ultimately resulting in V1 traveling off the edge of the road and colliding with the median guardrail.
