The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before entering. The driver of V1 stated that she looked left and then right before entering the intersection but did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. While V2 (the driver of the 2001 Toyota Highlander) also had a contributing factor in the crash by assuming that V1 would yield the right-of-way, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly surveilling the intersection before making the left turn.
