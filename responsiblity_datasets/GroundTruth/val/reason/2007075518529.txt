The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver admitted to not seeing that the traffic light was red until she had already entered the intersection. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1, which resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, an associative factor for V1's responsibility is that she was traveling too fast for the conditions due to being late for work. This suggests that V1 was not driving with the necessary caution and control given the wet road conditions and the need to stop at the intersection. In contrast, V2 (the driver of the 2005 Ford F-150) was stopped at the intersection and proceeded to make a left turn when the traffic signal indicated a green light for eastbound traffic. V2 had the right of way and was following the traffic rules correctly. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and traveling too fast for the conditions.
