The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in lane two and crossed straight through the intersection, impacting the front right of V1, the 2003 Honda Odyssey minivan. V2 overrode V1's front bumper, causing severe passenger compartment intrusion. V2's actions indicate that it failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was making a left turn from a stopped position.
