The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an unsafe lane change to her right, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle. This unsafe lane change and subsequent loss of control led to the vehicle rotating clockwise across all lanes, contacting the raised asphalt curb, and ultimately colliding with the concrete barrier. The driver's overcompensation while attempting to correct the unsafe lane change contributed to the accident.
