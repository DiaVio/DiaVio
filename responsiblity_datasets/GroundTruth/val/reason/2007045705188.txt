The reason for this is that V2 was crossing the intersection while V1 was traveling through a solid green light. V2 stated that the traffic signal was malfunctioning and was out, but the police report confirmed that the signal was actually working correctly, although the wind gusts were causing the signals facing north to sway and appear dark. Additionally, V2 mentioned that her view of V1 was obstructed by a pickup truck in the left turn only lane on the west leg of the intersection. However, V2 was coded as having looked but did not see, indicating that she failed to properly assess the situation before crossing the intersection. Therefore, V2's failure to yield to V1, despite the functioning traffic signal and obstructed view, makes V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
