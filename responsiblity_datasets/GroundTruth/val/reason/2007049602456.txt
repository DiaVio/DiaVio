The driver of V2 admitted to not looking to the left before entering the intersection, which indicates a failure to adequately survey the intersection before making the right turn. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance is a critical reason for the pre-crash event of V2. Additionally, the sightline restriction created by the high grass, shrubbery, and sign in the northwest corner of the intersection is mentioned as an associated factor for both drivers. However, it is important to note that V1 was traveling straight in their designated lane, while V2 was making a right turn. Therefore, V2 had the responsibility to ensure it was safe to proceed before making the turn, regardless of any sightline restrictions.
