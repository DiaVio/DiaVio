The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 steered left to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle that had encroached into their travel lane. This action caused V1 to lose directional control and ultimately collide with the concrete traffic barrier. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that the driver overcompensated in their attempt to avoid the collision. Additionally, the non-contact vehicle was considered an exterior distraction for the driver of V1, further contributing to the driver's loss of control.
