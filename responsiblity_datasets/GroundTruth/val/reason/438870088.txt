The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was possibly attempting to pass a slower vehicle while negotiating a right curve. As a result, Vehicle 1 departed its lane to the left, struck the right plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2003 Ford Taurus), and then departed the left side of the road again, ultimately colliding with a large tree. This sequence of events suggests that the actions of Vehicle 1, specifically the attempt to pass in a curve, led to the accident.
