The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and V2 (the 1985 Jeep Laredo) was traveling straight in the southbound lane. V1's right side was hit by the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1's left side then contacted V3 (the 1991 Mercury Cougar) in the intersection, further suggesting that V1 was at fault for not properly completing the left turn maneuver. It is important to note that the critical reason for V1's critical pre-crash event was listed as "unknown recognition error," further indicating that V1 may have made an error in judgment or failed to properly assess the situation before making the left turn.
