The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it changed lanes to the left, rotated counterclockwise, and traveled off the left side of the roadway. This indicates a loss of control by the driver of V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling too fast for conditions," which suggests that the driver was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the wet roadway conditions. The underinflated rear tires of V1 may have also contributed to the loss of control. Furthermore, the driver of V1 left the scene, which is an irresponsible action and further indicates their responsibility for the crash. Overall, the combination of the driver's loss of control, inappropriate speed for the conditions, and leaving the scene of the accident make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
