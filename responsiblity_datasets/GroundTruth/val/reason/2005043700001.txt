The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver stated her foot brake was not working as she approached the stopped cars, so she pulled the emergency brake and steered left. However, she was unable to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1 had a braking issue and was unable to stop in time, resulting in the rear-end collision with Vehicle 2 (V2).
