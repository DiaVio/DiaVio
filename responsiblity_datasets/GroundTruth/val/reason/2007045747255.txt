The driver of V1 attempted to turn left across the westbound lanes without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic in lane two. This failure to properly look and see the approaching V2 (the Mercedes ML3) resulted in V1 being struck by V2. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
