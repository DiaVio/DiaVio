The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 21-year-old male driver, departed the left pavement edge and collided with a large diameter tree, resulting in moderate damage. The vehicle then continued in a northerly direction and struck a second large diameter tree, causing severe damage. This sequence of events indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, leading to the collision.
