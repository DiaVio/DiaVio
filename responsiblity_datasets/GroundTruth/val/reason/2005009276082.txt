The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 19-year old male, was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. The critical reason for this event was coded as "Type of driver error unknown" due to the driver's inability to remember the crash. No associated factors were coded for V1. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2, driven by a 25-year old male, was when another vehicle encroached into his lane from the opposite direction. However, the critical reason for V2 was not coded, and no associated factors could be determined due to the lack of an interview. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error in making the left turn.
