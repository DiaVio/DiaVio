The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not obeying the traffic control device. She was upset and worried about a personal health-related problem, which likely contributed to her inadequate surveillance and illegal maneuver of failing to obey the traffic signal. V2 (the Pontiac Grand Prix) was traveling straight in his lane and attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the crash. The critical reason for the critical event of V2 was not coded to the driver, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, inadequate surveillance, and failure to obey the traffic control device.
