The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to "daydreaming" while driving, which indicates a lack of attention and focus on the road. This driver-related factor of inattention directly contributed to the critical pre-crash event of V1 crossing through the intersection and colliding with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 1999 Dodge Caravan) was stopped in traffic and proceeded to make a left turn, the critical reason for the pre-crash event of V2 was not coded to this vehicle. This suggests that V2's actions were not a significant contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and daydreaming while driving.
