The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This suggests that V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic, including V2 (the 2003 Suzuki motorcycle), resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, is not primarily responsible for the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Additionally, V2 stated that they did not see V1 prior to the crash, suggesting that they were not aware of V1's presence and therefore could not have taken appropriate action to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to adequately surveil the intersection, while V2 is not primarily responsible as they were not at fault for the collision.
