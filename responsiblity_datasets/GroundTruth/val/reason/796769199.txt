The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it was traveling in the right lane of a one-way, three-lane interstate highway when it crossed left across the other lanes of travel and departed the left side of the road. V1 then traveled a significant distance on the left roadside before colliding with trees and an embankment. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the subsequent events and injuries to the occupants.
