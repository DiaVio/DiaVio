The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 until the collision occurred, indicating inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a history of mental health issues and was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, which may have impaired their judgment and ability to operate the vehicle safely. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 start to pull out and attempted to brake to avoid the collision. This indicates that the driver of V2 was attentive and reacted appropriately to the situation, but was unable to avoid the collision due to the actions of V1. Therefore, based on the driver's inadequate surveillance, impaired condition, and failure to yield the right of way, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
