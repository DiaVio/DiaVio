The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead. The driver was looking to her right, searching for a phone number on a restaurant building, which caused her to fail to notice V2 suddenly stopping in front of her. This distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in time led to the collision. Additionally, V1 had vehicle-related factors that contributed to the accident, such as deficient tire conditions. The left front and left rear tires had insufficient tread depth, while the right rear tire had low air pressure. These vehicle deficiencies may have affected V1's ability to stop in time and avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and failure to react in a timely manner, as well as the vehicle-related deficiencies, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
