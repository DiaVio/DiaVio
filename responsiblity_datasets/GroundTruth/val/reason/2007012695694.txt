The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at his gauges, which caused him to not notice that V2 (the Chevrolet Malibu) was stopped in front of him. This distraction led to V1 being unable to stop in time and subsequently rear-ending V2. Additionally, the associated factors coded to the driver of V1, such as inadequate surveillance and engaging in non-driving activities, further support V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
