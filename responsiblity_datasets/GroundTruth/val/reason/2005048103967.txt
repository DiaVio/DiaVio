The driver of V1 was inattentive due to talking on their cell phone, which was identified as a driver-related factor. Additionally, inadequate surveillance and aggressive driving were also associated with V1. These factors indicate that V1 failed to properly observe and assess the traffic conditions while making a lane change, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1996 Toyota Camry).
