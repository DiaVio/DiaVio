The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of the vehicles in lane three. The driver of V1 admitted to being in a hurry and not noticing that the traffic in lane three was slowing down. This indicates a driver-related factor and a lack of attention on the part of V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating." This suggests that V1 failed to react appropriately to the slowing traffic and did not maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2). Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, combined with their failure to react in time, makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
