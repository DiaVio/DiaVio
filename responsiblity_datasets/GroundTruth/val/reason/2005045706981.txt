The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with failure to yield, indicating that they did not give the right of way to oncoming traffic. The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of other road users' actions. They stated that they were waved out by a non-contact vehicle, leading them to believe that it was clear to turn left. However, this assumption was incorrect, as Vehicle #2 was already in the left northbound lane and was slowing down for traffic ahead. Vehicle #1 failed to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, rush hour congestion was a contributing factor, which may have made it more difficult for Vehicle #1 to accurately judge the traffic conditions. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield and false assumption of other road users' actions.
