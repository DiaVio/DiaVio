The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, the glare of the sun was mentioned as an associated factor, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to realize that the traffic signal was red. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2000 Ford Excursion) entered the intersection after the traffic signal turned green, indicating that they had the right of way. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the intersection and recognize the red traffic signal.
