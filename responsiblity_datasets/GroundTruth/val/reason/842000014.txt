The driver of Vehicle 2 steered right in avoidance of an animal, causing the vehicle to partially depart the right pavement edge. Subsequently, the driver steered left in an attempt to re-direct the vehicle back onto the roadway. However, Vehicle 2 re-entered the roadway in a counterclockwise rotation, crossing the path of Vehicle 1. This resulted in the impact between the frontal area of Vehicle 1 and the right rear side surface of Vehicle 2. The rotation of Vehicle 2 was then re-directed in a clockwise manner, causing it to come to rest off the east pavement edge. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, specifically the attempt to re-direct the vehicle back onto the roadway, led to the collision with Vehicle 1.
