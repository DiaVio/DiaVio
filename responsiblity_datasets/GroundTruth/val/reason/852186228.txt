The reason for this is that V1 crossed the double yellow center lines while negotiating the curve to the right, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1996 Chevrolet Blazer. This indicates that V1 was not staying within its designated lane, which is a violation of traffic rules and regulations. Additionally, V1's front left impacted the front left of V2, suggesting that V1 was at fault for the collision. Furthermore, it is mentioned that V1 continued traveling west for quite a distance after the impact, indicating that V1 did not take appropriate measures to control the vehicle or mitigate the consequences of the collision. Lastly, it is important to note that the case occupant in V1 was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, which could have potentially reduced the severity of her injuries. However, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility for the accident itself.
