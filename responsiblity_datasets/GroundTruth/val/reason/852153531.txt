The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it departed the roadway to the right, traveled through the grass, and struck a square metal signpost. It then continued north and impacted a large tree, resulting in severe crush damage to the front right of V1 and significant intrusion into the passenger compartment. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control and stay within the designated travel lanes, ultimately leading to the crash.
