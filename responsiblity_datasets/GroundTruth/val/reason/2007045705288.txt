The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that V2 was the encroaching vehicle from the crossing street, turning into the same direction as V1. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the shrubbery that caused a sightline restriction was coded as a contributing factor for V2, further indicating that V2 did not have a clear view of the intersection before making the turn.
