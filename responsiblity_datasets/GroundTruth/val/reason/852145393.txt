The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way street and proceeded through the intersection straight, impacting the right side front of V1. V2's front left impacted V1's right side front, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was crossing straight through the intersection.
