The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling too fast to respond to the sudden stop of traffic in front of them. Despite being aware of the slowing traffic and attempting to change lanes, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2 (the 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser). This initial impact then caused a chain reaction, leading to further collisions involving V3 (the 2003 Toyota Camry) and V4 (unknown vehicle). V1's primary responsibility is supported by the critical pre-crash event coded as a driver error, as well as the associated factors of being in a hurry (late for work), the rain, wet roads, and rush hour traffic. These factors contributed to V1's inability to stop in time and avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and adjust their speed accordingly in response to the traffic conditions.
