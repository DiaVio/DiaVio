The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound in the center travel lane of the intersecting roadway, while V1 was traveling northbound in the right lane of the north-south roadway. V2, being on the intersecting roadway, should have yielded to the oncoming traffic on the north-south roadway. However, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, resulting in the left side impact. Therefore, V2 failed to yield the right of way, causing the collision and making it primarily responsible for the accident.
