The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions and following too closely. Despite the slick road conditions, V1 did not adjust their speed accordingly and failed to maintain a safe distance from V2. This resulted in V1 being unable to stop in time and colliding with the back of V2.
