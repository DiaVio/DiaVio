The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver took incorrect evasive action, which led to the vehicle running off the edge of the road and ultimately rolling over. The driver's choice of inappropriate evasive action contributed to the cause of the crash. Additionally, the driver's conversation with a passenger may have distracted them from properly reacting to the non-contact vehicle entering their lane.
