The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the rear of Vehicle 3, causing it to be pushed forward and across the southbound travel lanes. This initial impact set off a chain reaction, leading to the subsequent collision between Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 3. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 initiated the sequence of events that resulted in the accident.
