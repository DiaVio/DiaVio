The reason for this is that V1 departed the left side of the road and made contact with a fire hydrant and utility pole before coming to rest partially off the road. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by adjusting audio controls and looking up, which likely contributed to the vehicle leaving the road. Additionally, the driver was charged with no license and no insurance, indicating a lack of responsibility and compliance with traffic laws.
