The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection and impacted the front left side (door) of V1, the 2002 Honda CR-V. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. As a result of this collision, V1 was forced off the road and impacted a concrete light post, while V2 rotated 90 degrees and came to rest in the southeast quadrant of the intersection. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and causing the collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
