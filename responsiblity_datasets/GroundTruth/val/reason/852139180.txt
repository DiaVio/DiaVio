The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the right and departed the roadway, ultimately impacting a utility pole and a smaller pole adjacent to it. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and contacted a fence before coming to a final rest. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, leading to the collision with the utility pole and subsequent impact with the fence.
