The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that she "must have passed out behind the wheel" and mentioned feeling fatigued, disoriented, and nauseous leading up to the crash. Additionally, she had a head injury three weeks prior to the crash, which could have contributed to her physical impairment and inability to act properly while driving. Therefore, V1's physical impairment and loss of consciousness behind the wheel are the critical factors that led to the crash, making them primarily responsible.
