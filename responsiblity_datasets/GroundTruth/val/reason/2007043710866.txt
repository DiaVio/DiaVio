The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the right, entered other lanes, and then steered left, causing the vehicle to rotate in a counterclockwise fashion. This indicates a loss of control by the driver. Additionally, the driver admitted to knowing that the front brakes of the vehicle were bad, which could have contributed to the loss of control. The driver was also distracted by talking to his passenger and was traveling at a high speed for the conditions, considering the unsafe condition of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the condition of the vehicle, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
