The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver admitted to traveling at approximately 97 kmph (60 mph) and had been following V2 for some time with an estimated gap of 28 meters (30 feet). When V2 suddenly decelerated and steered to the left to avoid a non-contact vehicle, V1 was unable to slow down in time and ended up colliding with the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the braking action of V2. As a result, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and respond appropriately to the actions of the vehicle in front led to the rear-end collision.
