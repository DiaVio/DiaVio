The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which led to him losing control of the vehicle. This is evident from the critical precrash event, which states that the driver lost control due to traveling too fast for conditions and being unable to respond to unexpected actions of other road users. Additionally, the possibility of aggressive driving cannot be ruled out, as the driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he was passing the phantom vehicle on the right. This indicates a decision error on the part of the driver, as passing on the right can be risky and may have contributed to the loss of control. Furthermore, the presence of two young male passengers in Vehicle #1 may have served as a distraction or contributing factor to the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle. Overall, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to travel too fast for the conditions and potentially engage in aggressive driving behavior.
