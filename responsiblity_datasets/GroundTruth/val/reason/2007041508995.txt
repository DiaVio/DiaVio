The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that he looked to his left but did not see anyone before accelerating into the intersection. This indicates that the driver failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was also inattentive due to being focused on financial problems, which could have further contributed to the recognition error and inadequate surveillance. The fact that the driver of V1 either did not stop or only came to a rolling stop at the stop sign suggests a decision-related illegal maneuver, further indicating negligence on the part of V1. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1997 Mercury Sable) had a decision-related false assumption that the driver of V1 was going to stop. However, this false assumption does not absolve V1 of its primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error, inadequate surveillance, inattention, and decision-related illegal maneuver.
