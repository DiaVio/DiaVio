The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being "zoning and trying to catch my breath" just prior to the crash. This indicates that the driver was not paying attention and was inattentive while approaching the intersection. Additionally, the driver did not realize that the signal was red until he was almost into the intersection, suggesting a lack of awareness of the traffic conditions. On the other hand, there is no information available regarding the driver of V2 (the 2001 Honda Accord), so it is not possible to determine if any factors contributed to their involvement in the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's inattention and failure to realize the red signal, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
