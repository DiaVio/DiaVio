The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was not attentive to the driving task, as indicated by the police report. This lack of attention likely caused the driver to fail to notice that V2 was stopped at the red light, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he applied the brakes and steered to the right in an attempt to avoid the crash. This suggests that the driver was aware of the situation but failed to react in a timely and appropriate manner. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to react appropriately make them primarily responsible for the accident.
