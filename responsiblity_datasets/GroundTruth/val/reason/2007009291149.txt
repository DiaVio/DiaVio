The driver of V2 made an illegal maneuver by attempting to make a U-turn on a dark, hilly road. This decision, combined with inadequate surveillance, led to V2 positioning itself across the southbound lane, blocking the roadway. V1, traveling southbound, was unable to avoid the collision due to the sudden presence of V2 in its path. Therefore, V2's illegal maneuver and failure to properly assess the situation make it primarily responsible for the accident.
