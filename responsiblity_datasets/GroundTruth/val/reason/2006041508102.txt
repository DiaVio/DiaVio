The reason for this is that V1 initiated a series of lane changes, crossing over four southbound lanes of travel and making contact with the left side of V2 (the 2004 Lexus RX300). This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 could not be interviewed, making it unclear why they crossed over so many lanes. Therefore, V1's actions of changing lanes without proper caution or signaling, and ultimately causing the collision with V2, make them primarily responsible for the crash.
