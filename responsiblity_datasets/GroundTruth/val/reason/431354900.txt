The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle on the wet roadway while entering a right curve. This resulted in V1 traveling into the left lane and then crossing back across both northbound lanes before impacting a tree with its front end. The driver's lack of control and failure to maintain their lane ultimately led to the collision.
