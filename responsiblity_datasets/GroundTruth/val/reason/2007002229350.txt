The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection". Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as "false assumption". This suggests that Vehicle #2 made a false assumption about the actions of other vehicles at the intersection, which led to the collision with Vehicle #1. On the other hand, Vehicle #1 (the 2006 Infinity M35) was issued a summons for passing a red light, indicating that they violated the traffic signal. However, the primary responsibility for the crash lies with Vehicle #2 due to their false assumption while making a left turn at the intersection.
