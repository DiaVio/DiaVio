The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that they looked left and then right but did not see V2, and they failed to look left again before entering the intersection. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic from the northbound lane resulted in V1 entering the intersection when it was not clear to do so, leading to the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Grand Am) was involved in the crash, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." This indicates that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident, as the encroachment was caused by V1's failure to yield the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
