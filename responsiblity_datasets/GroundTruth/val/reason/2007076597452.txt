The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Cadillac Eldorado coupe) who was already in the intersection and intending to turn left. V1 stated that he saw V2 stopped in the intersection waiting for traffic to clear, but he proceeded to enter the intersection and collided with V2. This indicates that V1 did not exercise caution and failed to properly assess the situation before entering the intersection. Additionally, V1's statement that he hit his brakes but could not stop from impacting V2 suggests that he may have been traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions, as the posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph) and the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 40 kmph. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way and potentially traveling at an excessive speed.
