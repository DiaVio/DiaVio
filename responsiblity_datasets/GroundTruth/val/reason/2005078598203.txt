The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle after the left rear tire blew out. Instead of maintaining control and safely maneuvering the vehicle, V1 swerved to the right into the number one lane, which further exacerbated the situation. This sudden swerving and subsequent loss of control ultimately led to the vehicle overturning and coming to rest on its side. While the blowout of the left rear tire was a contributing factor to the accident, V1's actions in response to the tire failure, such as swerving and losing control, were the primary causes of the rollover.
