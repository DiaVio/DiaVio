The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control while negotiating the slight curve and overcompensated in an attempt to regain control, ultimately causing the vehicle to edge off the right side of the road. The driver's account of another vehicle being in his lane forcing him to swerve was not deemed credible by the researcher. Additionally, the driver's fractured left wrist, which was in a cast, and the medication he was taking for blood pressure may have hampered his ability to steer the vehicle effectively. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
