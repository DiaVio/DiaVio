The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to reduce speed and maintain a safe following distance, resulting in a collision with the back end of V2 (the 2002 Buick Rendezvous). V1's statement that she didn't expect the vehicle in front of her to slow down so fast indicates a lack of attention and awareness of the traffic conditions. Additionally, the police report states that all drivers were following too closely, further supporting V1's responsibility for the crash.
