The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance behind the other vehicles and struck V2 in the rear. This indicates that V1 was not paying attention to the traffic ahead and did not leave enough space to stop in time, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being unsure of what happened and did not provide much information about the crash, suggesting a lack of attentiveness and responsibility.
