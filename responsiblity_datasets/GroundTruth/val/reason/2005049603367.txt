The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing through it. The driver claimed to have waited several minutes before proceeding, but did not see V2 approaching from her right. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
