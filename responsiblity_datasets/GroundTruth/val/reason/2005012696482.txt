The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by following too closely to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle ahead. Instead of being able to stop in time, V1 attempted to avoid hitting the vehicle by making a sudden lane change, which resulted in losing control of the vehicle and colliding with a curb. This decision error ultimately led to the accident.
