The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was experiencing a seizure, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. The driver's medical condition and the fact that she was on medication for seizures indicate that she may not have been fit to drive. Additionally, the driver's fatigue and being in a hurry due to being late for work could have contributed to her inability to safely control the vehicle. The absence of shoulders on the road may have limited her options to safely pull over, but ultimately, the primary responsibility lies with the driver's medical condition and impaired ability to operate the vehicle.
