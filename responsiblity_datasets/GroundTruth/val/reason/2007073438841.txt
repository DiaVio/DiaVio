The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). Since V1 was the one making the left turn, they had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. By not properly surveilling the intersection and failing to see V2, V1 entered the intersection and collided with V2, causing the accident. It is important to note that the driver of V2, a fifty-year-old female, was not interviewed, and no further information is available about her. However, based on the given information, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
