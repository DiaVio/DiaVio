The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed into and over the northbound lanes, went off the left side of the roadway, and struck multiple parked vehicles. The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to not remembering any details of the crash and mentioned being in fair health, taking unspecified pain medication, and having only three hours of sleep in the past 24 hours. Additionally, the driver tested positive for opiates, cannabinoids, and benzodiazepine in a drug test conducted after the crash. These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle 1 was impaired and potentially under the influence of drugs, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to negotiate the curve and maintain control of the vehicle.
