The reason for this is that Vehicle one drifted into lane one, where Vehicle two (the 2000 Saturn) was driving. The contact between Vehicle one's wheels and Vehicle two's left side caused Vehicle two to lose control and swerve off the road, ultimately striking a tree. The driver of Vehicle one claimed that Vehicle two ran into him on his right side, but the Critical Pre-crash Event indicates that Vehicle one was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. This suggests that Vehicle one was not maintaining proper lane discipline, leading to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stay in their lane and encroaching into the adjacent lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two.
