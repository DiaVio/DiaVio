The driver of Vehicle One stated that he felt the car lose its grip and attempted to regain control by braking and steering hard right. However, he ultimately lost control of the vehicle and hit the curb. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to: poor road conditions [puddle, pot hole, ice, etc.] [Specify]: icy roads" and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as "environment related factor: slick roads [low friction road surface due to ice, loose debris, any other cause]". Based on this information, it can be inferred that the driver of Vehicle One failed to adjust his driving behavior to the icy road conditions. Despite being familiar with the road and driving the vehicle daily, the driver did not exercise caution and control, resulting in the loss of control and the subsequent crash. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident.
