The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 before attempting to change lanes to the left. This indicates a failure to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic, which is coded as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 tested positive for alcohol, which may have impaired their judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. On the other hand, there is no further information available for the driver of V2, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the adjacent lane. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and a positive alcohol test.
