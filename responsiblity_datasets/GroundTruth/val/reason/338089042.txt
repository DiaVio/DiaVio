The reason for this is that the driver allowed Vehicle 1 to veer off the road and onto the grassy shoulder, ultimately colliding with a large tree stump. The lack of restraint use by the driver, as evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seatbelt system, indicates that the driver was not properly secured at the time of the collision. This lack of restraint likely contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries. Additionally, the driver's interaction with various components within the vehicle, such as the knee bolster, steering wheel, and radio, suggests that the driver was not in full control of the vehicle and may have been distracted or not properly focused on the road. Therefore, based on these factors, Vehicle 1 and its unbelted driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
