The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a left turn onto the eastbound roadway and crossed into the path of V1, the 2003 Honda Odyssey, which was traveling straight in the northbound lanes. This resulted in the front plane of V2 impacting the front plane of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1.
