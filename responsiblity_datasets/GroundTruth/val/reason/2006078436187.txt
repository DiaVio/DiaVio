The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was suffering from strep throat, which could have contributed to his drowsiness. Additionally, the driver had an erratic sleep pattern and had not gotten much sleep over the previous weekend. These factors, combined with the driver's admission of feeling drowsy when he left work, indicate that driver-related factors, specifically the driver falling asleep at the wheel, led to the critical reason for the crash.
