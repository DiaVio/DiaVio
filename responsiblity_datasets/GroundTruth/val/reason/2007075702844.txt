The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver turned left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver mentioned that there was a car in the left turn lane going northbound, which may have prevented him from seeing V2. However, it is the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to proceed, even if there are other vehicles obstructing their view. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 approaching, resulting in the collision.
