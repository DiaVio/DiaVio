The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize that lane two was blocked off due to road repairs. Despite the lane being blocked with traffic cones and a square-shaped hole across the lane, V1 entered lane two and drove into the hole. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver, as they did not recognize the blocked lane and the potential danger it posed. Additionally, the city worker at the scene mentioned that some traffic cones on each side of the blocked lane were missing, indicating that there may have been a gap in the cones. However, V1's responsibility still lies in their failure to recognize that cones continued to block lane two across the bridge and that the lane was still closed off from traffic. Overall, V1's failure to recognize the blocked lane and their lack of attention and awareness make them primarily responsible for the crash.
