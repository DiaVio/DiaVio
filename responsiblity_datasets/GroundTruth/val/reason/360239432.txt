The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling behind another vehicle that was slowing down to make a right turn at the intersection. V1 then braked and swerved to the left, crossing over the center lane line and entering the northbound lane. This action resulted in the collision with Vehicle two (V2), the 2005 Chevrolet Colorado four door pickup truck, which was traveling northbound and had just passed through the intersection.
