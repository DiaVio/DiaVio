The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling in the second lane of a four-lane road and entered the intersection while Vehicle 1 (the 2005 Nissan Sentra compact sedan) was in the process of making a left turn. Vehicle 2 impacted the left side of Vehicle 1, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and sustain moderate damage. Since Vehicle 2 was approaching the intersection and should have yielded to Vehicle 1, it can be concluded that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
