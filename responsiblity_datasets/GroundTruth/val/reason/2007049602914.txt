The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the road to the left onto the curbed median, ultimately striking a light pole and causing it to fall into the westbound lanes of traffic. This indicates that V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the light pole. V2 (the driver of the 1999 Ford Explorer) was not involved in the first harmful event and did not have time to take any avoidance action. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the crash.
