The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver was not utilizing the manual safety belt, which is a violation of traffic safety regulations. This lack of restraint likely contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries. Additionally, V1 departed the right side of the roadway and struck a concrete culvert and a large boulder, indicating a loss of control by the driver.
