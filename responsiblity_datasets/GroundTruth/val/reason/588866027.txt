The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the right side plane of Vehicle 1 in the northbound travel lane of the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was already in the intersection and intending to turn left. The impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate counterclockwise and disengage from Vehicle 2, resulting in further collisions and ultimately causing Vehicle 1 to leave the roadway and come to rest in the grass median.
