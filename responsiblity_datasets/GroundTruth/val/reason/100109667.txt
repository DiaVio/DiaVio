The reason for this is that the driver of V2 allowed their vehicle to drift left, crossing the double centerline and into the path of vehicle 1 (V1), the 2000 Ford F-150 pickup. This action resulted in a head-on, extreme off-set left impact between the two vehicles. Therefore, the driver of V2 is primarily responsible for causing the accident.
