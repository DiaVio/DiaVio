The driver of V1 made several errors that led to the crash. Firstly, they attempted to pass slower vehicles by moving from lane two into lane one, which was a right-turn only lane. This maneuver was improper and potentially dangerous. Secondly, when lane one came to an end, the driver of V1 swerved to the left, causing the vehicle to partially go off the right side of the roadway and ramp up and over the curb. This indicates a lack of control and poor decision-making. Lastly, V1 lost control of the vehicle and began to rotate clockwise, ultimately colliding with a tree on the left side. This suggests a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and adapt to the wet road conditions. Overall, the driver of V1's actions, including improper lane changes, loss of control, and failure to adapt to the weather conditions, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
