The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he had been keeping up with traffic when he suddenly encountered Vehicle #2 stopped in his lane. However, the critical reason for the pre-crash event was determined to be inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of Vehicle #1. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately observe the road ahead and failed to notice that Vehicle #2 was stopped, resulting in the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to exercise proper surveillance and avoid the collision.
