The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the 2004 Honda Accord, attempted to pull over to the right shoulder without properly ensuring that it was safe to do so. V2 encroached into the path of V1, the 1998 Dodge Stratus, without giving enough time and attention to the surrounding traffic. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V2 was also distracted by an erratically driven phantom vehicle ahead, which further contributed to the incorrect evasive action taken. Therefore, V2's failure to properly assess the situation and safely maneuver the vehicle makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
