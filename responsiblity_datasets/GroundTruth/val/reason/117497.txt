The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the right tires of V1 to drift off the right road edge, and when attempting to re-enter the road, the driver oversteered and crossed the centerline and eastbound lane. This resulted in V1 departing the left side of the road and causing a chain of collisions with a wooden privacy fence, a parked travel trailer, and a small tree. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the proper lane ultimately led to the accident.
