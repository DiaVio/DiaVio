The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking in the rear-view mirror to check on her crying child. This distraction caused the driver to fail to recognize that V2 (the 2001 Infiniti QX4) had started to decelerate due to traffic ahead stopping for a red traffic signal. As a result, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2. While V2 was also involved in the collision, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 was not the primary cause of the collision, but rather a result of V1's failure to control their vehicle due to distraction. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision.
