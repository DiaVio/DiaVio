The driver of V1 made a decision error by incorrectly taking evasive action. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle and braking to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle, the driver swerved right and ultimately struck a telephone pole. This decision error led to the crash and subsequent damage to V1. Additionally, the driver's admission of being distracted by drinking a bottle of water while driving suggests a lack of focus and attention on the road, further contributing to the driver's responsibility for the accident.
