The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it lost control while negotiating a left curve, crossed the grass median, and re-entered the roadway, ultimately impacting V2 in the left lane of travel. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and veered into oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2.
