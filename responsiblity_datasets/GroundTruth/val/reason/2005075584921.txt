The driver of V1 was found to be asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to feeling drowsy and fatigued, and stated that he always wakes up feeling tired. Additionally, the driver had just finished working and had been driving for only about 15 minutes before the crash occurred. The driver's last sleep was 15.5 hours prior to the crash, after a sleep duration of 7.5 hours. These factors indicate that the driver was likely experiencing severe fatigue and sleep deprivation, which impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
