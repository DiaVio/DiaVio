The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver became distracted by another vehicle traveling in front and to the right of V1. This distraction caused V1 to not notice that traffic was stopped in the travel lane until it was too late to avoid the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V1 is coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: other vehicle stopped" and the critical reason for this event is coded as "driver related: external distraction".
