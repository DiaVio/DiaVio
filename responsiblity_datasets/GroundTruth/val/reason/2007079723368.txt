The driver of V1 admitted to inadequate surveillance, stating that he was looking straight ahead but never saw V2 prior to the impact. This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 has underlying health conditions and takes medications that may have affected his ability to perceive and react to the situation. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper caution and awareness while making the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
