The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted internally, engaged in a conversation with the passenger and trying to keep a dog in the back seat. This distraction caused the driver to almost miss her right-hand turn and subsequently turn too fast for the curve. The driver's internal distraction and failure to slow down for the turn were the critical factors that led to the accident.
