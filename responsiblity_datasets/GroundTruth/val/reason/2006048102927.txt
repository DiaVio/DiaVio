The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a blackout and departed the left side of the lane, ultimately crashing into a sign and coming to rest in a ditch. The driver's history of seizures, chronic back pain, and feeling tired indicate potential health issues that could have impaired her ability to drive safely. Additionally, the driver stated that she had no recollection of driving to the crash scene, further suggesting a lack of awareness or control over her actions. Therefore, the driver's physical impairment and potential medical condition contribute to her responsibility for the crash.
