The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1's driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road, which was identified as a critical reason for the pre-crash event. - The driver of V1 admitted to looking inside the vehicle, possibly lighting a cigarette, instead of focusing on driving. - Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, which impaired their ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle. - The fact that V1 crossed over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane indicates poor directional control and a failure to stay within their designated lane. Therefore, V1's distracted driving, combined with being under the influence of alcohol and poor directional control, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
