The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the icy conditions. The driver admitted to traveling 10 to 15 mph over the posted speed limit, which indicates a disregard for the road conditions. Additionally, the driver's inability to avoid the collision despite attempting avoidance maneuvers suggests a lack of control and proper judgment. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to adjust to the icy conditions make them primarily responsible for the crash.
