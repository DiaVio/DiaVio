The driver of V1 was traveling at a reported speed of 105 kmph (65 mph), which exceeds the statutory speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). Additionally, tire/yaw marks on the dirt/gravel road surface indicate that the vehicle initiated a counterclockwise yaw before leaving the roadway and entering the dirt embankment. The driver then steered hard right, causing the vehicle to initiate a clockwise rotation before rolling over multiple times. The driver's claim of swerving to avoid an oncoming vehicle with its lights off was discounted, as there was no physical evidence of any avoidance maneuver on the road surface. The driver's poor directional control and excessive speed are identified as driver-related factors that contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, resulting in the vehicle leaving the roadway and rolling over.
