The reason for this is that V1, the Toyota Tacoma, impacted the right front of V2, the Dodge Ram, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1 continued traveling in a southeastern direction after the impact, suggesting that V1 did not take appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision.
