The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 steered left in an attempt to avoid an animal (deer) on the road, which caused V1 to cross the centerline and run off the left side of the road. The subsequent actions of the driver, including steering right and causing V1 to re-enter the road in a clockwise rotation, ultimately led to V1 crossing both lanes of the road and departing the right side, resulting in a rollover. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane of travel contributed to the accident.
