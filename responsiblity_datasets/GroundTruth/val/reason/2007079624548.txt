The reason for this is that V2 changed lanes to the right without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane. The driver failed to look or see V1 before changing lanes, which resulted in the front plane of V1 contacting the right plane of V2. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield to the vehicle in the adjacent lane.
