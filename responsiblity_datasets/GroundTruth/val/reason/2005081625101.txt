The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one made an illegal maneuver by disregarding the traffic signal. She changed lanes at the last minute and proceeded into the intersection when the light was green, possibly the left turn arrow. This action resulted in the collision with Vehicle two (the 1998 Toyota 4-Runner) which was already in the intersection, following the green left turn arrow. Therefore, Vehicle one's disregard of the traffic signal and illegal lane change led to the accident.
