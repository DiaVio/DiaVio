The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and failed to stop for the traffic control device, which is categorized as an illegal maneuver. V2 (the 2005 GMC Straight Truck) was traveling in its original travel lane and stopped in traffic, indicating that it was following the traffic rules and not encroaching on the path of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and obey the traffic signal makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
