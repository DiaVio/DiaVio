The reason for this is that V1 experienced a right front wheel separation while making a right turn, causing it to rollover and come to a final rest on its top. This indicates a vehicle-related factor, specifically a tires/wheel failure. Since the driver of V1 left the scene before the police and researcher arrived, there is no information available about the driver's actions or potential contributing factors. Therefore, the responsibility for the crash falls on V1 itself due to the vehicle failure.
