The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the intersecting roadway, and it failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 1998 Toyota Camry) traveling east on the intersecting roadway. V1 struck V2 in the right side, indicating that V1 was at fault for not properly judging the distance and speed of oncoming traffic before making the turn.
