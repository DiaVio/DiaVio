The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was involved in a minor right side impact with Vehicle 2 (the 2011 Chevrolet Impala), indicating that Vehicle 1 was the one that initiated the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 1 was the one that subsequently rolled over and collided with a light post, resulting in the extensive roof intrusion and the subsequent injuries to the occupant.
