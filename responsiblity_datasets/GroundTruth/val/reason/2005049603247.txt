The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to the vehicle in front of them and failed to leave enough gap distance to stop in time and avoid the collision with V2 (the Ford F-150 Pick up truck). Additionally, V1 failed to reduce their speed for the school zone speed limit, which further contributed to the accident.
