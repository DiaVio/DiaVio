The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving. The driver admitted to being lost in thought and not seeing the stop sign. This inattention led to V1's vehicle colliding with the left side of V2's vehicle, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way. While V2 (the driver of the 1987 Chrysler Fifth Avenue) stated that he saw V1 but thought they would stop, it is important to note that V2 was not required to stop at the intersection. V2 had the right of way and was proceeding straight through the intersection. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and their inattention while driving.
