The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was turning left from a private driveway onto the roadway, which requires yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making the left turn, as indicated by the critical reason of inadequate surveillance. - The driver of V1 admitted to being on the phone with a friend during the crash, indicating a distraction from the task of driving. - Additionally, the low tread on V1's tires was coded as an associated factor, suggesting a potential safety issue with the vehicle. While V2 (the driver of the 1995 Plymouth Voyager minivan) made an avoidance maneuver by swerving left, it can be argued that V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. V2's assumption that V1 would yield the right of way, although a contributing factor, does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to yield. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance, distraction, and failure to yield the right of way when turning left from the private driveway.
