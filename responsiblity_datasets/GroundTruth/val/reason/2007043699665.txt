The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made sudden steering inputs without properly checking for other vehicles, leading to a loss of control. This sudden lane change and subsequent overcompensation caused V1 to collide with the median guardrail and roll over. The driver's lack of attention and failure to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the accident.
