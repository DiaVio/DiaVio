The reason for this is that V1 was leaving a driveway and failed to yield the right-of-way to V2, who was already traveling in the eastbound lane. V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other; leaving a driveway" and the critical reason was "driver related factor; external distraction." This suggests that V1 was distracted by something external, possibly the non-contact vehicle, and failed to see V2 approaching. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from driveway, turning into opposite direction." However, the critical reason for V2's pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right-of-way and their distracted driving.
