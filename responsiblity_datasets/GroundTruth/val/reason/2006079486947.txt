The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by her cell phone ringing and took her eyes off the road to search for it. This distraction caused her to miss the change in the traffic signal to red and resulted in her entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so. V1's driver-related recognition error of internal distraction led to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2002 Ford Explorer) cannot be solely held responsible as the driver was following the traffic signal and had the right of way. However, it is important to note that V2's driver did not check for crossing traffic before entering the intersection, which contributed to the collision.
