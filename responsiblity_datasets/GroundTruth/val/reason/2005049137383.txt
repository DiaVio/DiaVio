The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn across the path of oncoming traffic when the light turned yellow. However, the driver falsely assumed that the oncoming traffic would stop for the yellow light. This false assumption led to V1 accelerating in an attempt to avoid the collision, but ultimately resulted in V1 being struck by V2 (the 2003 Dodge Durango SUV). Therefore, V1's false assumption of other's actions and failure to yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
