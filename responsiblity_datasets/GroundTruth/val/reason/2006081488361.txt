The reason for this is that V1 was reported to have driven in an aggressive manner, entering the intersection against the red-light traffic control. This aggressive driving behavior led to V1 encroaching into the path of V2 (the 2004 Hyundai Sonata) as it was making a left turn on a green arrow. V1's decision to proceed through the intersection against the traffic control resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to obey the traffic control signal make them primarily responsible for the accident.
