The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to notice that V2 (the driver of the 1997 Pontiac Sunfire) was parked on the side of the road. V1 was engaged in a conversation on her cell phone, checked her clock, and was looking for the exit ramp. She made a false assumption that V2 was still on the exit ramp and did not realize that it was stopped on the side of the road. This distraction and failure to pay attention to the road ahead led to the collision. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the wet roadway conditions and had tires with very little tread, which further contributed to the accident. The heavy rain and wet roadway were also associated factors that affected both drivers, but V1's distraction and failure to notice the parked vehicle were the primary causes of the accident.
