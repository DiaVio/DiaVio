The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver stated that she had been up late studying the previous night and had fallen asleep while driving. This driver-related factor of being asleep directly led to V1 departing the travel lane, passing through multiple lanes, and ultimately crashing into a tree.
