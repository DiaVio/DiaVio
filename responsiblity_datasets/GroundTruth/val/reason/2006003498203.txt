The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, and V1 was going straight. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 refused to be interviewed and did not allow his vehicle to be inspected, which suggests a lack of cooperation and potential attempts to avoid responsibility.
