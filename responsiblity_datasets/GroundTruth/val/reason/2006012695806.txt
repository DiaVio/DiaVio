The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical pre-crash event coded to V1 was "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the approaching vehicle (V2). This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 colliding with the left side of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that her vehicle's windshield had a glare due to the dash panel, which made it difficult for her to see oncoming traffic at certain times of the day. However, this does not absolve her of responsibility as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure clear visibility before making a turn. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
