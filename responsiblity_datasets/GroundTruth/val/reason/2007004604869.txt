The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, misjudging the gap or the speed of V2. This misjudgment led to V1 turning in front of V2, resulting in the collision. V1 did not take any avoidance maneuvers to prevent the accident. On the other hand, V2 was traveling straight through the intersection and did not have any critical reason assigned to their vehicle. The driver of V2 reported that V1 suddenly turned in front of them, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
