The reason for this is that V2 was stopped at a stop sign and entered into southbound traffic without properly judging the gap distance or speed of V1. This misjudgment led to V2 crossing into the path of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the tires of V2 did not have an adequate amount of tread depth, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to properly control the vehicle.
