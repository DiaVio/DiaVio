The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and entered the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 was distracted by a non-contact vehicle making a U-turn, which caused her to not see V2 (the 2005 Mack gravel truck) approaching the intersection. Additionally, the drug test indicated that the driver of V1 had ingested opiates, which may have impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and her distracted driving, combined with the influence of drugs, make her primarily responsible for the accident.
