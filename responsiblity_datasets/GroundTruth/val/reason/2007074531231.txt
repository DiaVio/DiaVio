The driver of V1 was fatigued due to working long hours and having insufficient sleep. This fatigue likely impaired her ability to properly observe and react to the traffic situation, leading to her failure to adequately surveil the intersection and obey the traffic control device. As a result, V1 entered the intersection without seeing V2 (the 1995 Chevrolet Lumina), causing the collision.
