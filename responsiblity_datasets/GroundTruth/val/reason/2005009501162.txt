The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering left and making a lane departure to the left, resulting in the right front of V1 making contact with the front right of V2. The driver of V1 reported inattention and being preoccupied with some concerns immediately before the crash, indicating a lack of focus and attentiveness while driving. This incorrect evasive action and inattention led to the lane departure and subsequent collision with V2.
