The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the opposing traffic before executing the left turn. This is evident from the fact that the driver did not observe the oncoming Nissan Altima and turned in front of it, resulting in the collision. The driver's internal distraction, caused by his son complaining about being hungry and listening to the radio, contributed to the inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Nissan Altima) was traveling on the green light and had the right of way. Although V2 accelerated just before entering the intersection, it was V1's failure to yield to the oncoming traffic that caused the collision. Therefore, V2 cannot be primarily held responsible for the accident.
