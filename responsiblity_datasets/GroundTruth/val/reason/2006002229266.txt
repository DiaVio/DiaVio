The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel, which is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver was 8.5 months pregnant and fatigued at the time of the crash, further contributing to her inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Falling asleep while driving is a serious negligence that puts not only the driver's life at risk but also the lives of her passengers and other road users.
