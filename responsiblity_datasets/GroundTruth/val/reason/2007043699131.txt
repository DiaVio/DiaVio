The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver made an unnecessary and excessive braking maneuver while changing lanes to take the exit. This sudden deceleration caused V1 (the Mack truck) to be unable to reduce speed in time and resulted in the collision. Additionally, V2's driver admitted to always slowing down to 48 kmph (30 mph) for any highway exit, which may have contributed to the unexpected and abrupt change in speed. It is important to note that V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit and was unable to avoid the collision due to V2's sudden deceleration. Therefore, V2's actions were the critical reason for the accident.
