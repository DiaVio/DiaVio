The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 made abrupt steering maneuvers, first to the right and then back to the left, which caused the vehicle to travel off the left roadside and onto the median where it collided with the large mound of dirt. These abrupt maneuvers and subsequent collision led to the rollover and the disabling damage to the vehicle.
