The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver took incorrect evasive action when encountering the flock of geese on the road. Instead of safely maneuvering around the geese, the driver braked and swerved left onto the grass median, which resulted in losing control of the vehicle and colliding with a tree. Additionally, factors such as wearing golf shoes while driving, inadequate surveillance, poor directional control (traveling an additional 30 meters after hitting the geese), and animals on the road contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
