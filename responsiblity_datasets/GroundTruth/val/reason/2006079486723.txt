The reason for this is that V2 failed to maintain a safe distance from V1 and made a false assumption about the actions of the driver of V1. V2 impacted the rear of V1, causing V1 to travel into the intersection. V2 should have been aware of the traffic conditions and should have anticipated that V1 might stop at the yellow light. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe distance and false assumption of the other driver's actions led to the collision.
