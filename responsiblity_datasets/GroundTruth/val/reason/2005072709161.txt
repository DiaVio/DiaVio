The reason for this is as follows: - The driver lost control of the vehicle, skidding across multiple lanes and ultimately crashing into a tree. - The critical reason for the accident was identified as "aggressive driving behavior" (speeding), indicating that the driver was driving in excess of the speed limit. - The driver's father stated that his son regularly drove in excess of the speed limit, further supporting the notion of speeding being a contributing factor. - The driver was also cited for speeding in excess of 30 mph over the speed limit, as per the police accident report. - The driver's inexperience (being licensed for less than two years) and youth were additional factors that contributed to the accident. - Distractive factors such as the presence of friends and the driver changing a CD were also mentioned, indicating a lack of focus on the road. Overall, the combination of aggressive driving behavior (speeding), inexperience, and distractions suggests that V1 (the driver of the Volvo S60 sedan) is primarily responsible for the accident.
