The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the number-three lane and failed to notice the stopped Vehicle 2 (V2) in front of them. Instead of stopping or maneuvering safely to avoid a collision, the driver of V1 attempted to steer left to avoid V2, but ended up striking V2 in the back left. This initial impact caused V2 to be propelled forward and to the right, while V1 began to rotate clockwise. However, before V1 could rotate significantly, it was struck on its back right corner by the front of Vehicle 3 (V3). This secondary impact to the back of V1 ceased its rotation and propelled it to the left, where it came to rest facing north. Therefore, while V3 also played a role in the accident by striking V1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to notice and safely respond to the stopped V2 in front of them.
