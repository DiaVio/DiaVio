The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding to make a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she looked left and right but did not see V2 before entering the intersection. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not fully focused on driving due to thinking about future events and activities for the remainder of the day. This further supports the conclusion that V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and failed to exercise proper caution at the intersection. On the other hand, V2 was traveling within the speed limit and had the right of way as indicated by the flashing amber light for the east/west road. The driver of V2 noticed V1 stopped at the intersection and expected V1 to yield. However, due to V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield, V2 was unable to avoid the collision despite applying the brakes and sliding on the wet pavement. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and inattention, while V2's actions were a result of V1's failure to yield.
