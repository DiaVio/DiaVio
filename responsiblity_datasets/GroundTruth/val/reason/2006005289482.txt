The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the red light at the intersection, as stated by the driver herself during the partial interview. This failure to stop for a traffic control device is a clear violation of traffic laws and indicates a disregard for the safety of other road users. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being unfamiliar with the area and it being her first time on that particular roadway, which suggests a lack of experience and knowledge of the traffic patterns in that location. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1993 Geo Prism) was following the proper course of action by negotiating the curve and attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. There is no indication of any fault or contributing factors on the part of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to stop for the red light and her inexperience in the area.
