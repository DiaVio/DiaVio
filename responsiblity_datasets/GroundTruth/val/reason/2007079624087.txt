The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal factor, specifically, attempting to put a spilled coffee cup in the center console cup-holder. This distraction caused the driver to inadvertently steer to the right and travel off the edge of the road, resulting in the collision with the pole.
