The driver of V1 did not possess a valid driver's license and attempted a left turn at the intersection without stopping. A witness at the scene described how V1 ran the red light at a high rate of speed. This witness's account is supported by the statements made by the driver of V2 (the 2007 BMW) and the dynamics of the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the red light and attempt a left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
