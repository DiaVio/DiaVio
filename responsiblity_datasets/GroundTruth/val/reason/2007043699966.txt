The reason for this is that the Critical Reason for Vehicle 1 was a driver-related factor of an unknown recognition error. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated that Vehicle 1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph), which indicates that Vehicle 1 was not able to stop or avoid the collision in time. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the right front tire of Vehicle 1 had inadequate tread depth, which suggests that the vehicle may have had reduced traction and control. On the other hand, Vehicle 2 (the GMC waste hauler) was driving within the speed limit and stated that he did not have a chance to react in avoidance. The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle 2 was other vehicle encroachment from a crossing street across the path, indicating that Vehicle 2 had the right of way. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to a driver-related recognition error and potential vehicle maintenance issues.
