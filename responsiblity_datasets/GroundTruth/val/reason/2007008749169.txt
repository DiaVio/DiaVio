The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by crossing the lane line to the left in an attempt to avoid another vehicle. This action resulted in V1 impacting the concrete barrier, crossing back across the roadway, and ultimately coming to rest on the shoulder. Additionally, the driver of V1 was charged with DUI, indicating that their impaired state may have contributed to the incorrect evasive action taken.
