The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road. He admitted to looking down inside his car to either grab a cigarette or change the CD, which caused him to miss the fact that the traffic in his lane was stopped. This recognition error and internal distraction led to V1 swerving off the road and into a ditch, resulting in the accident.
