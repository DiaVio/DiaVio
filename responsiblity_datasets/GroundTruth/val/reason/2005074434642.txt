The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V3 (the Chrysler PT Cruiser) which was going straight. V2 almost came to a complete stop, but the left front bumper corner of V3 still made contact with the right rear bumper corner of V2. This indicates that V2 did not properly assess the situation and failed to ensure that it was safe to make the left turn. Additionally, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 may have misjudged the speed of V3, leading to the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the collision due to its failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the situation.
