The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the intersection facing west, intending to turn left. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not look to the side before turning. This indicates inadequate surveillance and inattentiveness on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was an inexperienced 17-year-old with a learner's permit, which may have contributed to the lack of proper judgment and decision-making in this situation.
