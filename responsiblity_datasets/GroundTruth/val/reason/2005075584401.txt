The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was experiencing a physical impairment, specifically a coughing fit, which caused him to miss his intended turn and subsequently collide with V2, V3, and V4. The driver's history of similar incidents in the past further supports the conclusion that his physical impairment was a contributing factor in this accident.
