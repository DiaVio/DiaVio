The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 crossed the centerline and struck Vehicle #2 (1988 Honda Civic) in a sideswipe type crash. After the initial collision, Vehicle #1 continued in the left lane and subsequently struck Vehicle #3 (1997 Oldsmobile Aurora) head-on. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason for this event was coded as an unknown critical non-performance error, possibly due to the driver's drug use (methadone found on his person) and observed drifting over the centerline by a witness. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash as it initiated the sequence of events leading to the collisions with Vehicle #2 and Vehicle #3.
