The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than V1 and struck the back of V1. V2's higher speed and failure to maintain a safe distance from V1 indicate a driver-related error. Additionally, V2's driver immediately leaving the scene without being interviewed suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability.
