The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that it was traveling at a higher speed than the case vehicle (V1) and attempted to pass it on the shoulder, resulting in a collision with the right side of the rear of V1. This action by V2 caused V1 to enter a counterclockwise rotation and cross the center-line, ultimately leading to the collision with Vehicle Three (V3). Therefore, V2's decision to pass on the shoulder and the subsequent collision initiated the chain of events that led to the accident.
