The reason for this is that V2 was entering the roadway from a business driveway and began to turn left, intending to travel south. However, V2 entered the lane of travel of Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2006 Subaru Impreza sedan, which was traveling north in lane one. Despite the driver of V1 braking, the front of V1 still impacted the left side of V2. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 and made an improper left turn, resulting in the collision.
