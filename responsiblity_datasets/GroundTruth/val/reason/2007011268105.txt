The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy and snow-covered road conditions, which resulted in a loss of vehicle control. The driver's inexperience, as he had been licensed for less than one year, and the fact that he was in a hurry to pick up his girlfriend further contributed to the accident. The slick conditions of the roadway also played a role in the accident. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust his speed to the road conditions and his poor vehicle control.
