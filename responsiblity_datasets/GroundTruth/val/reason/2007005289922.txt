The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that made contact with the back of V2 (the 1997 Toyota Rav 4), initiating the chain reaction that caused V2 to collide with V3 (the 2000 BMW 525). V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision with V2.
