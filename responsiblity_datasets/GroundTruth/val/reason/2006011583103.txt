The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. Despite claiming to have looked both ways, the driver did not see V2 (the 2006 Ford Fusion) approaching from the southbound direction. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 striking the right side of V2. Additionally, there are several associated factors that contribute to V1's responsibility. The driver of V1 was fatigued at the time of the crash, having missed her normal afternoon nap. Fatigue can impair a driver's ability to focus and react appropriately, increasing the risk of accidents. Furthermore, the driver of V1 had pre-existing conditions, including sleep apnea, and was taking multiple medications. These factors may have further compromised her alertness and ability to safely operate the vehicle. On the other hand, V2's driver was not primarily responsible for the crash. V2 was driving down the roadway when V1 entered the intersection from a side street, giving V2 no time to react or attempt an avoidance maneuver. While V2's driver had sleep apnea and was talking on a cell phone at the time of the crash, these factors were not directly related to the cause of the accident. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and associated factors such as fatigue and pre-existing conditions.
