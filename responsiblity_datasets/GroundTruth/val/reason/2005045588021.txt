The reason for Vehicle #1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control while negotiating the curve, crossed into the eastbound lanes, and struck Vehicle #2 head-on. The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with failure to maintain lane and driving without a license. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was an inexperienced 16-year-old driver with a learner's permit, which indicates a lack of driving skills and experience. The driver of Vehicle #1 was also not wearing a seatbelt, and the airbag in the vehicle was not properly installed, further contributing to the severity of the injuries sustained by the occupants of Vehicle #1.
