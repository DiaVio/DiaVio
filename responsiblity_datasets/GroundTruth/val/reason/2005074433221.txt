The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection" and the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver related factor: "illegal maneuver, for disregard of traffic control sign." Additionally, V2's driver was found to have made decision and performance errors by driving aggressively, including speeding and violating traffic control devices. The lack of evidence of skid marks suggests that V2 did not make any evasive actions to avoid the collision.
