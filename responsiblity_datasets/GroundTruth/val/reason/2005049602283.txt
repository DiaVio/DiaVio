The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. V1 failed to see V2 (the 1993 Nissan Altima) approaching in the second lane from the opposite direction, resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, was not at fault as there were no additional factors identified for this driver, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction over the left lane line.
