The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) on a wet road with low friction conditions. The driver admitted to underestimating the wet road and wet bridge, indicating a failure to exercise caution and adjust their driving behavior accordingly. Additionally, the driver was running late for work and may have been emotionally concerned about being late, which could have contributed to their decision to drive at an excessive speed. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience, as indicated by their Graduated License Level 2 driving restriction, may have played a role in their inability to maintain control of the vehicle while hydroplaning. Overall, the driver of V1 demonstrated several driver-related factors that contributed to the crash, including driving too fast for the conditions, poor directional control, an emotional concern, inexperience, and a failure to recognize the need for caution on wet roads.
