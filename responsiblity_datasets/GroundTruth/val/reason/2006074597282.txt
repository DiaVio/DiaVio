The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two changed lanes abruptly to the left without ensuring it was safe to do so. This resulted in a collision with the right side of Vehicle one (1997 Ford F-150). The driver of Vehicle two should have taken the correct evasive action by steering right and braking, instead of steering back to the left. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle two was aware of the presence of Vehicle one as they made the move to pass it. Therefore, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's improper lane change and incorrect evasive action.
