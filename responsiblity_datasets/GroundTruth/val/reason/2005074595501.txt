The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 disregarded the traffic signal by proceeding through the intersection when the light was red. This illegal maneuver directly led to the collision with V2 (the Oldsmobile Achieva Coupe). Additionally, V1 was traveling with lights and sirens on for a non-emergency pickup, which is not justified and may have contributed to the driver's improper surveillance and sight restrictions. Therefore, V1's disregard of the traffic signal and improper use of emergency vehicle equipment make them primarily responsible for the accident.
