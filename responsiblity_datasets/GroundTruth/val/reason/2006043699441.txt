The driver of V2 stated that she looked both ways but was not able to see the oncoming vehicle due to roadway curvature and trees. However, images from the scene reconstruction dispute this claim. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V2 was inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see), indicating that the driver failed to properly observe the intersection before proceeding. Furthermore, factors such as driver inexperience (having only been driving for 12 months) and a tire deficiency (dangerously low tread on the tires) were associated with V2. These factors contribute to the driver's inability to react in time to avoid the collision.
