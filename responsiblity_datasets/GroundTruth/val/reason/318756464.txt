The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling north on a divided road and continued straight through the intersection while Vehicle 1 (the 2008 Honda Civic) was in the process of making a left turn. Vehicle 2 impacted the left front fender of Vehicle 1, causing it to spin rapidly in a clockwise rotation. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
