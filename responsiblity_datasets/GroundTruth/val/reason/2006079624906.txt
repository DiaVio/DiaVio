The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize and adequately surveil the intersection. The driver admitted to not seeing the stop sign or the approaching V2 until it was too late. This indicates a driver-related recognition error and inattention, which led to inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the antilock braking system and the reported weird feeling of the brakes may have contributed to the inability to stop in time. V2 (the driver of the 1995 Ford Taurus sedan) cannot be attributed with primary responsibility as she saw V1's approach but assumed he would stop for the stop sign. This assumption, while incorrect, does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to yield at the stop sign and causing the collision.
