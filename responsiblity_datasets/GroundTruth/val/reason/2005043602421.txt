The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the Nissan Stanza, attempted a left turn across the path of V2, the Chevrolet Silverado, without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. V1 entered the left-turn lane and proceeded to turn left into the gas station without considering the possibility of a vehicle being in the oncoming lane. This failure to look and properly assess the situation led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the associated factors coded to V1, such as being engaged in conversation with the passenger and focusing on an exterior location (the gas station), indicate a lack of attention and distraction on the part of the driver. On the other hand, V2, the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado, was driving straight on the roadway and had the right of way. V2 blew the horn and applied the brakes in an attempt to avoid the collision, but V1 did not react in time. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
