The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 relinquished control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, resulting in V1 drifting left, crossing the centerline, and ultimately colliding with a tree on the side of the road. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
