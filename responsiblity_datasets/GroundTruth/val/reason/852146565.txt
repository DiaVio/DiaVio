The reason for this is that V1, while traveling eastbound on a curved highway, failed to negotiate the curve and entered the opposite lane, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1997 Honda Odyssey. V1's failure to stay in its designated lane and its subsequent impact with V2 indicates that V1 was primarily responsible for causing the accident.
