The critical event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over left lane line." This indicates that V2 attempted to make a left turn from the eastbound lanes and encroached into the path of V1, which was traveling straight in the westbound lanes. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision. V1 (the driver of the 1991 Chrysler New Yorker sedan) may have been traveling at a higher rate of speed, but this does not absolve V2 of their responsibility for the accident. V2's failure to properly execute the left turn and yield to oncoming traffic is the primary cause of the collision.
