The reason for this is that V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see V1 before the collision occurred. Therefore, V2's lack of surveillance and failure to look for oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
