The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling south on the secondary road and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling west on the arterial road. Vehicle 1 stopped at the stop sign but then proceeded to cross the arterial road without properly judging the gap or the speed of Vehicle 2. This decision error by the driver of Vehicle 1 led to the collision with Vehicle 2.
