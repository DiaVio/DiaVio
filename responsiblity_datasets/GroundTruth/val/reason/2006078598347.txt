The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign located prior to the railroad tracks. This is evident from the fact that V1 crossed the railroad tracks without stopping and then skidded across the road and driveway before ultimately ending up in the canal. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated that V1's speed prior to braking was 80 kmph (50 mph) or greater, which indicates that the driver was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and excessive speed.
