The driver of V1 was an unlicensed driver who was traveling in the wrong direction on a one-way road and attempted to either crossover the intersection or turn left at the intersection. This illegal maneuver, along with inadequate surveillance of the intersection and a blocked sight line due to the presence of a school bus, led to the collision. V1's decision to turn with an obstructed view and their illegal maneuver were the critical reasons for the crash.
