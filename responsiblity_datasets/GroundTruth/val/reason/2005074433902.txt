The reason for this is that V1 experienced a brake failure, which caused them to be unable to stop at the red traffic signal. Additionally, V1 attempted to steer left to avoid a collision with V2 (the driver of the 2004 Honda Pilot SUV), but still made contact with V2's vehicle. V1's brake failure and inability to stop or avoid the collision contributed to the accident.
