The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the tractor-trailer, was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and misjudged the turning radius of his trailer. He failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, resulting in the trailer scraping the back end of V1's vehicle and tearing off the bumper cover. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 was in a hurry due to being late for the scheduled delivery, which may have contributed to his poor judgment and lack of attention to the turning maneuver.
