The reason for this is that V1 failed to respond in time to the slowing traffic ahead and rear-ended V2 (the Toyota Corolla), which then rear-ended V3 (the Nissan Sentra). This indicates that V1 was either following too closely or misjudged the gap and speed of the forward traffic. Additionally, the fact that V1 had severe front-end damage suggests that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2 and V3, further supporting V1's responsibility for the collision.
