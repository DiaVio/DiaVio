The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 105 kmph (65 mph) and was unable to respond to the sudden stop of the vehicle ahead (V2) due to a decision error of driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she braked hard but her vehicle continued forward without skidding or lock-up, indicating a failure to control the vehicle's speed. The driver of V1 also mentioned being unable to change lanes due to surrounding traffic, suggesting a lack of awareness and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
