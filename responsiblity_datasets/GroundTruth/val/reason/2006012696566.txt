The driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including speeding and cutting across two lanes of traffic to get around merging vehicles. This behavior ultimately led to V1 going off the roadway and losing control, resulting in the collision with the barrier wall, light pole, and guardrail. Additionally, factors such as conversation with passengers, poor directional control, driver inexperience, low tread on the tires, and the wet roadway contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
