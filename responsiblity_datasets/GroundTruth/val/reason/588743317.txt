The reason for this is that the case occupant's vehicle was involved in two moderate pole impacts, with the frontal impact having a 12 o'clock principal direction of force and the top plane impact involving a non-horizontal force. The case occupant's frontal impact airbag deployed, indicating a significant impact. The case occupant was projected forward and to the right during the frontal impact, likely making contact with the deployed airbag and possibly bending the steering wheel rim with his chest/abdomen. Furthermore, the case vehicle rolled left and struck another pole with its front left corner area, resulting in deformation of the left front/top plane, left A-pillar, left side rail, and roof panel. It is suspected that the case occupant's head struck/was struck by the intruding B-pillar and left side rail during this impact, leading to a left intraventricular hemorrhage and bilateral scalp abrasions. Overall, the case occupant's vehicle was primarily responsible for the accident due to its involvement in multiple impacts and the resulting injuries sustained by the case occupant.
