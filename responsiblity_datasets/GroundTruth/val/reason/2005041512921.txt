The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at directions and not paying attention to the road. This distraction caused a recognition error, leading to a rear-end collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned being in a hurry and having work-related stress, which could have further contributed to his inattention and recognition error. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Ford Windstar minivan) stated that she was stopped at the red light for a significant amount of time and was focused on construction work to her right. While she may have been externally distracted, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for not maintaining a safe distance and failing to react in time to the traffic situation. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle ahead.
