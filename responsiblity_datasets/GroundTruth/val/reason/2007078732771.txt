The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2 (the 1991 Ford Ranger pickup) while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction. V1 was unable to decelerate or avoid the collision, indicating a driver-related error. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she does not remember what happened before the crash, suggesting a lack of attention or awareness. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's error and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
