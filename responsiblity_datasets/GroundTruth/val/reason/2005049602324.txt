The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V1 approached the stop sign too fast and applied the brakes too late to avoid the collision. The lack of skid marks suggests that the driver did not attempt to stop in time. Additionally, the driver admitted to not looking left or right before entering the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance are the primary factors that led to the crash.
