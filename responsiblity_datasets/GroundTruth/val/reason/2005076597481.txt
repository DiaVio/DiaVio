The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 40 kmph, which is above the posted speed limit of 25 mph for the curve. The driver was going too fast for the curve, resulting in the vehicle departing the road and colliding with a rock. This indicates that the driver failed to adjust their speed to the road conditions and did not follow the warning signs.
