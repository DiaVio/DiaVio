The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that they saw a red light and let off the gas, assuming that V2 was moving. However, V2 was actually stopped at the time of the crash. This false assumption led to V1 entering the third lane and colliding with the rear of V2, which then caused V2 to collide with the rear of V3. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to accurately assess the situation and the actions of other vehicles on the road make them primarily responsible for the accident.
