The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 crossed into the northbound lane while negotiating the left curve, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation in response to crossing into the northbound lane further contributed to the rollover. The driver's unknown eye problem, which restricts his driving to daylight hours only, is also a contributing factor as the crash occurred shortly before midnight when visibility would have been reduced. Overall, V1's driver-related factors, including poor directional control and the driver's vision impairment, played a significant role in causing the accident.
