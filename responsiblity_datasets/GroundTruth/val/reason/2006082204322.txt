The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep before the crash and was found to have tested positive for cocaine. This indicates that the driver was impaired and not in a condition to operate the vehicle safely. The driver's decision to continue driving despite feeling tired and under the influence of drugs contributed to the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver was familiar with the road and drove it daily suggests that the crash was a result of driver error rather than any external factors.
