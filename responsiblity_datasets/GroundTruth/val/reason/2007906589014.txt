The driver of Vehicle one claims to have lost control while trying to avoid contact with an unknown vehicle in the adjacent lane. This evasive action resulted in Vehicle one veering to the left and sideswiping Vehicle two (the 2000 Mazda 626 sedan). Vehicle one then continued to lose control, rolling onto its left side and crashing into the guardrail before coming to a final rest. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle one indicates that it was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, suggesting that the driver may have been driving erratically or not maintaining proper lane position. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded to Vehicle one is "incorrect evasive action," indicating that the driver's response to the situation was not appropriate or effective. On the other hand, Vehicle two was traveling in its designated lane and was struck by Vehicle one when it veered into its lane. The driver of Vehicle two attempted to slow down but was unable to avoid the collision. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle two indicates that there was an encroachment from the adjacent lane, suggesting that Vehicle one crossed over into Vehicle two's lane. However, it is important to note that the driver of Vehicle two was also potentially distracted by talking to a passenger, which may have contributed to the accident. In summary, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and loss of control, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two and subsequent crash into the guardrail.
