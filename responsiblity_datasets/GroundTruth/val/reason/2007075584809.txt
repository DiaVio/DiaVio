The reason for this is that the driver of V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, indicating a lack of proper control of the vehicle. The driver then overcompensated by steering left and applying the brakes, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise and cross back over the roadway, ultimately resulting in a rollover. Additionally, the driver's vision impairment, as they were not wearing their required vision-correcting glasses, and their inexperience (only one year of driving experience) were contributing factors to the crash. These factors further support the conclusion that V1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
