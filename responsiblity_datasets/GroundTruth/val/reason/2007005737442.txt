The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 proceeded through a red traffic signal, which is an illegal maneuver. This action directly caused the collision with V2 (the Mercedes Benz CLK convertible) that was in the intersection legally, intending to make a right turn. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and stop at the red light makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
