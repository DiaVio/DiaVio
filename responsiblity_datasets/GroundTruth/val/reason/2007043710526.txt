The reason for this is that V2 ran the stop sign and failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the collision. Additionally, V2 admitted to being inattentive to her driving and being impaired by alcohol, which further contributed to her failure to observe the oncoming vehicle. The fact that V2 had only driven on this road twice and was drowsy due to lack of sleep also indicates a lack of familiarity with the roadway and potential fatigue, which could have impaired her ability to react appropriately.
