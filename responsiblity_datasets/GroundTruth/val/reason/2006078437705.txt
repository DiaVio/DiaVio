The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep at the wheel, crossing the centerline and impacting vehicle two (V2). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to the driver being sleepy and actually asleep. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction over left lane line" and the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's fatigue and falling asleep at the wheel.
