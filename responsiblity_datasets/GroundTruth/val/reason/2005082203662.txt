The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left-hand turn onto the westbound roadway without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Mercury coupe). V2 was traveling eastbound in lane 2 and assumed that V1 would yield, but V1 continued with the left-hand turn, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for inadequate surveillance, indicating that she failed to properly look or see the oncoming vehicle. The driver of V1 also mentioned that the grade of the road may have been a factor in not seeing the other vehicle, but this does not absolve her of responsibility for failing to yield the right of way.
