The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver had not slept in over 24 hours prior to the crash, indicating a severe lack of rest and fatigue. This combination of falling asleep and fatigue likely impaired the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the drift off the road, collision with the sign and telephone pole, and subsequent rollover. The driver's failure to wear corrective lenses, despite having a vision impairment, further demonstrates a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic safety regulations.
