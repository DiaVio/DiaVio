The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn at the intersection, which resulted in the front of V1 colliding with the front of V2 (the 1993 Honda Civic coupe). Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 fled from the scene of the crash, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
