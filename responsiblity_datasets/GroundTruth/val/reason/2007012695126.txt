The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a snow-covered roadway. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event coded as "vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions" and the critical reason coded as "too fast for conditions (snow-covered roadway)." The driver's loss of control and rotation of the vehicle, crossing lanes and the centerline, ultimately led to the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 1992 Ford F-150 pick-up) attempted to avoid the crash by decelerating and steering right into lane #1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their excessive speed for the snowy road conditions.
