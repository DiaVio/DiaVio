The driver of V1 stated that V2 suddenly entered lane one without notice, causing V1 to take evasive action to avoid a collision. This sudden lane change by V2 created a dangerous situation for V1, leading to V1 losing control and ultimately crashing into the guardrail. Additionally, the police report indicated that V1 was traveling at a speed of 64 kmph (40 mph), which was above the reported speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). While V1's speed may have contributed to the severity of the accident, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for making an unsafe lane change without providing sufficient notice or warning to V1.
