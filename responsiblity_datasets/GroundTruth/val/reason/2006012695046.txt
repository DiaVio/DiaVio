The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by looking at a previous crash, which caused him to not realize the traffic slowing down quickly enough. Additionally, the Event Data Recorder (EDR) reported a speed of 121kmph (75mph) prior to the crash, which indicates that V1 was traveling at a significantly higher speed than the reported range of 34-48kmph (21-30mph). This excessive speed, combined with the distraction, contributed to V1's inability to avoid colliding with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1993 Chevrolet Suburban) was stopped due to the traffic backup from another crash, which suggests that he was following the appropriate traffic conditions. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be a contributing factor to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to distracted driving and excessive speed, while V2 was following the traffic conditions appropriately.
