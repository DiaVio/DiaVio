The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when a non-contact vehicle in lane two began to change lanes to the right. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle and avoiding the collision, V1 applied the brakes and steered to the right, causing the vehicle to skid longitudinally onto the shoulder and collide with the parked V2 (1989 Pontiac Grand Am). V1's overcompensation and loss of control ultimately led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
