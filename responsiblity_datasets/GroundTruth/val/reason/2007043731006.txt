The driver of V1, a 15-year-old male, was driving without a fully licensed driver in the vehicle, which is a violation of the level one restriction of his graduated permit. Additionally, he admitted to being distracted by adjusting his radio for "a few seconds" before realizing he was on the wrong side of the road. This distraction, combined with his excessive speed and insufficient steering and braking, led to him losing control of the vehicle and crashing into a tree. The driver's inexperience, as well as the low tread on three of the four tires, further contributed to the accident.
