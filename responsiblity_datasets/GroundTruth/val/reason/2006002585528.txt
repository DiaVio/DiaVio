The reason for this is that the driver of V1 overcompensated when trying to avoid hitting a squirrel that crossed the roadway. This oversteering caused V1 to rotate clockwise and ultimately go off the right side of the road, striking a dirt embankment. The driver's inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action also contributed to the crash.
