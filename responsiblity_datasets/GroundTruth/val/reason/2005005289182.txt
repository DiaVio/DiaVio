The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver crossed the double yellow lines and struck a wall before continuing forward and making contact with the parked pick-up truck. This indicates that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and veered into the opposite lane, causing the collision. The driver's admission of being potentially distracted by talking on the CB radio further supports V1's responsibility for the crash.
