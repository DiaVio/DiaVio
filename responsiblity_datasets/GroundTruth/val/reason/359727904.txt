The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it failed to avoid colliding with the stopped vehicles ahead (V2 and V3) despite having sufficient time and opportunity to do so. V1's driver braked and steered right but still impacted the back of V2, causing a chain reaction collision with V3. This indicates a failure to maintain a safe following distance and exercise proper control of the vehicle.
