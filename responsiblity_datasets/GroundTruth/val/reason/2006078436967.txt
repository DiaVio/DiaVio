The reason for this is that V1, the Nissan Sentra, was stopped in the left turn lane for about 2-3 seconds before making a left turn across the path of V2, the Toyota Corolla. V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 approaching from the right, before making the left turn. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 entering the lane of V2, causing the collision.
