The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right pavement edge while negotiating a left curve, indicating that the driver may have lost control of the vehicle. The driver's steering maneuvers then caused the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and ultimately collide with a large tree on the right side. This suggests that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
