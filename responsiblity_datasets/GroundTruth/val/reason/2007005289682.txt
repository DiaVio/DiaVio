The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn into the entrance of a gas station, crossing the path of V2 (the driver of the 2006 Hyundai Elantra) who was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, indicating inadequate surveillance as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, V1 proceeded with insufficient clearance, meaning that there was not enough space or time for V1 to safely complete the turn without interfering with the path of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and proceed with sufficient clearance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
