The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control while merging from the on-ramp lane to the southbound lanes. V1 rotated clockwise and made contact with the concrete barrier, indicating a loss of control. This loss of control caused V1 to slide laterally across multiple southbound lanes, ultimately resulting in the severe impact with Vehicle 2 (V2). The subsequent impacts with Vehicle 3 (V3) were also a result of V1's initial loss of control.
