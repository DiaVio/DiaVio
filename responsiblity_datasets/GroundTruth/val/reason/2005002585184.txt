The reason for this is inadequate surveillance and a recognition error on the part of the driver of Vehicle #1. The driver stated that she did not see any "road closed" signs before the crash, despite there being several signs prior to the detour. This suggests that the driver was not paying sufficient attention to the road and may have been distracted or inattentive. Additionally, the driver's use of prescription and non-prescription medications, including female replacement hormones, vitamins, aspirin, and a natural herbal supplement, may have contributed to her inattentiveness or impaired her ability to recognize and respond to the signs indicating the road closure.
