The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that their traffic signal was red and did not adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. This driver's inadequate surveillance, specifically their failure to look or look but not see, was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. As a result, V1 collided with V2, causing damage to both vehicles.
