The driver of Vehicle One admitted that she was unable to stop at the stop sign due to the snow and ice-covered road conditions. She slid into the intersection and attempted to turn left, knowing she couldn't stop. This indicates that she failed to exercise caution and adjust her driving behavior according to the road conditions. Although the driver of Vehicle Two (the 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup) stated that he thought Vehicle One had stopped at the stop sign, he also mentioned that he saw the nose of Vehicle One dive down abruptly, indicating a panic stop. He attempted to brake and turn right but was unable to do so due to the road conditions. However, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle One as the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and made a left turn into the path of Vehicle Two. The driver's decision to turn left without ensuring it was safe to do so, especially in poor road conditions, contributed to the accident.
