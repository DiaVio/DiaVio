The reason for this is that the driver of V2 reportedly lost control on the icy road and crossed the centerline, resulting in the collision with Vehicle one (V1). The driver of V1 could not avoid the collision, indicating that V2's loss of control and crossing the centerline was the main cause of the accident.
