The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph, which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 56 kmph. Additionally, V1 departed the left side of the roadway and struck multiple objects, indicating that the driver was not in control of the vehicle. The driver's intoxication, as evidenced by the blood alcohol level of .248 percent, further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
