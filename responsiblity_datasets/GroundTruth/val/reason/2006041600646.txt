The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an error by overcompensating when a non-contact vehicle cut into his lane. Instead of maintaining control of his vehicle, V1 jerked the steering wheel to the left, causing the vehicle to lose control and ultimately collide with the concrete barrier walls on both sides of the travel lanes. This overcompensation by V1 resulted in the loss of control and subsequent crash.
