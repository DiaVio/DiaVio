The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to change lanes into lane one when his front right tire hit the left side of V2 (the 1992 Mazda MX3). The driver of V2 tried to avoid the crash by swerving into the emergency paved shoulder, but ended up hitting V3 (the 1984 BMW) that was disabled on the shoulder. The driver of V1 initially claimed that he was already in lane one and witnessed V2 hitting the parked car, but this story was deemed not believable due to the evidence. Paint transfer on the right side guardrail from V2 indicated that she went off the roadway due to V1 cutting into her lane. Additionally, V1's right front tire damage further supports the fact that V1 was attempting to change lanes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to his improper lane change and failure to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic.
