The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stopped at the stop sign and observed V2 approaching from the east. However, the driver did not look to the left again to ensure it was still safe to proceed. As a result, V1 turned directly into the path of V2, causing the collision. V1 also did not make any avoidance maneuver to prevent the accident.
