The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the road. The posted speed limit was 72 kmph (45 mph), but the driver admitted to driving at 64 kmph (40 mph) around the left curve. Additionally, the driver overcorrected when her right tires went off the road, causing the vehicle to spin out of control and collide with several trees. This overcorrection was a driver-related factor and a critical reason for the accident. Furthermore, the driver's panic and failure to follow proper steering techniques (not jerking the car back on the road) contributed to the loss of control. The driver's familiarity with the curve and her claim of not being distracted by any interior or exterior sources indicate that the primary cause of the accident was her actions and decisions while driving. While there were some roadway deficiencies, such as the lanes not meeting AASHTO's recommendation and the curve not meeting the minimum radius for the posted speed limit, these factors alone do not absolve the driver of responsibility. The driver's excessive speed and overcorrection were the primary factors leading to the accident.
