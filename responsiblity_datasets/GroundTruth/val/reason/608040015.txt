The reason for this is that V1 was merging into the outside southbound lane and its front contacted the left quarter-panel of Vehicle Two (V2), the 1990 Plymouth Lazer. This contact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and come to a rest facing north in the outside southbound lane. Additionally, after impacting V2, V1 struck a concrete traffic barrier and rolled over, coming to rest in the distress lane facing northwest. Therefore, V1's actions of merging into the lane and making contact with V2 resulted in the accident, making it primarily responsible.
