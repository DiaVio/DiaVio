The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to the hazardous driving conditions caused by the snow, slushy road, and ice. V1 traveled across the center lane line and the eastbound travel lane before ultimately colliding with a large tree off the left side of the roadway. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane indicates their responsibility for the accident.
