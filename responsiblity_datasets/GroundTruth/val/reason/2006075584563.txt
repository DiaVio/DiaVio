The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by reaching for food and looking to the right, causing the vehicle to run off the left side of the road. Additionally, the driver overcorrected to the right, leading to the vehicle rolling and ultimately coming to rest in a field. The critical reason for the accident was coded as "driver related-internal distraction."
