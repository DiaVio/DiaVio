The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was proceeding straight on the westbound lane while Vehicle 1 was attempting to turn left (east) from a parking lot. Vehicle 2 collided with the left rear side of Vehicle 1, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest straddling the south pavement edge of the roadway. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 2 was a rescue vehicle responding to an emergency call with its lights and siren activated, which further emphasizes the need for Vehicle 2 to exercise caution and yield to other vehicles on the road.
