The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they ran the stop sign and entered the intersection, despite intending to take a left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by their pant leg getting stuck on the accelerator, which took their attention away from driving. V2 (the driver of the 1997 Nissan Quest Van) was traveling northbound in lane one and had the right of way since there was a stop sign for the east/west lanes only. V2 was not at fault for the collision as they were following the rules of the road and did not encroach on V1's path. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to stop at the stop sign, entering the intersection, and being distracted while driving.
