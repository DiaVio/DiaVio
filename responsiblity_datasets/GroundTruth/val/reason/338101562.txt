The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 broke traction on the wet road surface, initiating a counterclockwise rotation on a downhill slope. As a result, Vehicle 2 entered the southbound travel lane and crossed the path of Vehicle 1 (the 2006 Scion XB subcompact 5-door hatchback), causing the collision.
