The reason for this is that the front right CV joint on V1's suspension broke, causing the car to exit the roadway and collide with an overhead light pole. This mechanical failure directly led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver of V1 was aware that the CV joint was going to fail soon, as warned by the mechanic during an oil change two days prior to the crash. However, the driver chose to continue driving without getting it fixed, assuming he had more time. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the failure to address the known mechanical issue, which ultimately resulted in the accident.
