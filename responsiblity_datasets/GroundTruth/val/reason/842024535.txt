The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline and departed the left pavement edge, ultimately colliding with multiple trees. The driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a forward trajectory in response to the impact force, indicating that they were not able to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's serious injuries suggest that they were unable to take appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision.
