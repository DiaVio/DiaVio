The reason for this is that the driver of V2 lost control of their vehicle, mounted a barrier curb, struck a bench and a light pole, and then entered the east-west roadway just as the case vehicle was completing a right turn onto it. V2 subsequently struck the case vehicle on the right side. This sequence of events indicates that the driver of V2 was not able to maintain control of their vehicle, resulting in the collision with the case vehicle.
