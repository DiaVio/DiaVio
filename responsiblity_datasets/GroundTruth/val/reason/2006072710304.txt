The driver of V1 stated that he was driving close behind vehicles and always in a hurry. This suggests that he was likely tailgating V2, the school bus, which was stopped in the lane to pick up passengers. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "too fast for conditions to be able to respond to unexpected actions of other road users." This indicates that V1 was driving at a speed that did not allow him to react in time to the stopped school bus. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to maintain a safe following distance, combined with his excessive speed for the conditions, make him primarily responsible for the accident.
