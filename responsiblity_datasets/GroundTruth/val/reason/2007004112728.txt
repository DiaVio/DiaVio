The driver of V1 attempted to make an illegal U-turn without adequately checking for oncoming traffic. The driver admitted to not looking in both directions and failed to see V2 (the Dodge Caravan) approaching. This lack of surveillance and inadequate attention to the road led to V1 turning directly into the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that they tried to avoid the collision by accelerating, indicating a lack of proper judgment and decision-making. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, illegal maneuver, and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
