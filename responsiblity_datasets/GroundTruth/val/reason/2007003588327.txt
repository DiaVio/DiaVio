The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they were driving the wrong way in the westbound lane, which is an illegal maneuver. This action directly contributed to the collision with V1, who was turning left at the intersection. V2's decision to drive in the wrong direction on the roadway created a hazardous situation and violated traffic laws, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
