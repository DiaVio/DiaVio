Reason: V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including rapid lane changes and fleeing from a previous minor crash. The driver of V1 was also found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.38, indicating severe intoxication. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was not in a proper state to operate a vehicle safely, leading to the loss of control, multiple collisions, and ultimately the fatal outcome of the accident.
