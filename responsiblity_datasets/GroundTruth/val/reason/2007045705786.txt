The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a decision error by turning left with an obstructed view. Despite the presence of a pickup truck blocking her view of northbound traffic, she proceeded to cross the northbound lane and was subsequently hit by V2 (the driver of the 2002 Ford Escape). While V2 also had a sightline restriction caused by the non-contact vehicle in the crossover, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was the encroachment of the other vehicle from the opposite direction over the left lane line. The critical reason for V2 was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's decision error and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make her primarily responsible for the accident.
