The reason for this is that V1 veered to the left outside of the travel lanes, resulting in a collision with a legally parked vehicle. The driver of V1 admitted that he might have fallen asleep and drifted off the roadway, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, further supporting the driver's poor directional control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
