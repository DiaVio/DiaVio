The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that a wall partially blocked their view of V2 (the 1998 Buick LeSabre), but it was determined that the wall did not obstruct the view. V1 did not see V2 prior to the impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling-turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was "inadequate surveillance." On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1998 Buick LeSabre) was distracted by reaching for a box of tissues on the right floorboard and unbuckling his seat belt. While this distraction was an associated factor in the crash, it does not absolve V1 of their primary responsibility for failing to properly observe the intersection before making a left turn.
