The driver of V1 reported no injuries and did not provide an interview, but according to the police report, V1 traveled over the left lane line and struck the left side of V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling over lane line on the left side of the travel lane." Although the reason for V1 traveling over the lane line is unknown, it is clear that V1's actions caused the collision. The driver of V2 stated that he noticed V1 drifting into his lane approximately 5 seconds before the collision and attempted to avoid the collision by steering towards the curb and slowing down, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their lane encroachment, which resulted in the collision with V2.
