The reason for this is that V1 entered the left turn lane too soon, before reaching the designated lane markings for turning left at the intersection. This illegal maneuver caused V1 to collide with V2 (the driver of the 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix) who was also in the left turn lane. Additionally, the rain, wet roads, and heavy rush hour congestion were contributing factors to the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an illegal maneuver and entering the turn lane prematurely.
