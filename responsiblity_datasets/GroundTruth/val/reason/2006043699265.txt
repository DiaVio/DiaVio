The reason for V1's responsibility is that it lost control and began skidding, ultimately resulting in the vehicle traveling off the left side of the road, striking the guardrail, and then crossing the roadway before ultimately colliding with a tree off the right roadside. The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 80 kmph (50 mph), which indicates that V1 was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to be using a learner's permit, indicating inexperience, and the vehicle had dangerously worn tires. These factors suggest that the driver may not have had the necessary skills or equipment to safely navigate the roadway. Overall, V1's loss of control, excessive speed, and potential lack of experience and proper equipment make it primarily responsible for the crash.
