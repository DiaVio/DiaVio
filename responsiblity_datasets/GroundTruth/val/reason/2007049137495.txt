The driver of V1 attempted to change lanes from the fifth lane into the fourth lane without adequate surveillance, resulting in the right side of V1 striking the left side of V2. This initial impact then caused a chain reaction, leading to subsequent collisions between V2 and V3, and V1 and V4. Reason: V1 is primarily responsible for the crash because the driver failed to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes, which resulted in the collision with V2.
