The reason for Vehicle # 1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the stop sign. The driver's view was obstructed by a parked van near the southwest corner of the intersection, which was blocking the sightline to Vehicle # 2 (Subaru Forester). Additionally, the driver was an inexperienced driver, having driven for less than 12 months, which may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance. While Vehicle # 2 (Subaru Forester) stated that Vehicle # 1 ran the stop sign, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle # 2 was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, across path," indicating that Vehicle # 1 was already in the intersection when the collision occurred. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle # 1 (Ford Explorer) is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and crossing with an obstructed view.
