The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and departed the roadway on the left side. This indicates poor directional control and a failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver's fatigue, as mentioned in the case summary, was a factor in the crash.
