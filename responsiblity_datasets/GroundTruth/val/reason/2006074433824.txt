The reason for this is that V1 was traveling through the intersection while the signal for V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Grand Am) turned green, indicating that it was V2's right of way to proceed. V1's inattention and daydreaming, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, contributed to the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.127 suggests that the driver was impaired at the time of the accident, further supporting their responsibility for the collision.
