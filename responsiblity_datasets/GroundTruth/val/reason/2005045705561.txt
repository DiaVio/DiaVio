The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to taking his eyes off the road for a moment, being distracted by looking at some girls to his right. This distraction caused him to fail to recognize that Vehicle #2 (2003 Ford Ranger pickup) was slowing down to make a left turn onto the intersecting side road. Vehicle #1 then struck the rear end of Vehicle #2. Additionally, there were contributing factors to the driver of Vehicle #1's actions, such as fatigue from lack of sleep and working long hours, as well as the possibility of drug usage due to the presence of a strong marijuana odor. These factors may have impaired the driver's ability to focus and react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the decelerating Vehicle #2.
