However, based on the evidence at the scene, it can be inferred that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash. Reason: V1, a 1993 Mercury Grand Marquis, was traveling eastbound in the #4 lane when it veered to the left, departed the roadway, and hit the concrete median wall. The police report indicates that the vehicle smelled heavily of alcohol and numerous beer bottles were found inside. Additionally, the occupants of V1 were seen fleeing the crash site. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 may have been under the influence of alcohol, which could have impaired their ability to maintain control of the vehicle and resulted in the crash.
