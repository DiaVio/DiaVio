The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V2 stated that she never saw V1 prior to the crash, indicating a recognition error and inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V2 was traveling at a high rate of speed for a left turn, which further contributed to the collision.
