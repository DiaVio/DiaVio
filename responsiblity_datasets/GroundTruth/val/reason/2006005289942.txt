The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was "following too closely to respond to unexpected actions." This indicates that V1 was tailgating or not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2). As a result, when V2 slowed down or stopped, V1 was unable to react in time to prevent the collision. It is important for drivers to maintain a safe following distance to allow for sufficient reaction time and avoid rear-end collisions. In this case, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and respond to the actions of the vehicle in front led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible.
