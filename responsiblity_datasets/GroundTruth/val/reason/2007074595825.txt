The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V2 was the vehicle that was crossing the intersection. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This suggests that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe and notice the presence of V1 before entering the intersection, leading to the collision.
