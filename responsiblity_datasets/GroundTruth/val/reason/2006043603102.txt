The driver of V1 crossed the double yellow lines and entered the westbound lane, causing a sideswipe collision with V2 (the driver of the 2001 Mazda Protégé MP3). This initial action by V1 initiated the chain of events that led to the subsequent collision with V3 (the driver of the 2004 Honda Pilot). The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. The Critical Reason for this event was coded as poor directional control, suggesting that V1 inadequately steered and controlled the vehicle around the curve. It was also coded that V1 was traveling too fast and did not realize the caution required for the curve. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, crossing the double yellow lines, and traveling too fast for the curve are the reasons why V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash.
