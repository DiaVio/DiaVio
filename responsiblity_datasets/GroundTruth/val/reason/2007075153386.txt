The driver of V1 made several errors that contributed to the crash, including aggressive driving behavior by attempting to pass in a no-passing zone and crossing a double yellow center lane line. Additionally, the driver made a decision error by driving too fast for the curve, which caused the vehicle to lose control and run off the left side of the roadway. The driver's internal distraction, talking to the passenger and listening to the radio, likely affected their ability to maintain proper directional control. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience, as they had been driving for only a year, likely played a role in their poor decision-making and inability to handle the vehicle in this situation. Overall, the driver's aggressive driving behavior, decision errors, distractions, and inexperience make them primarily responsible for the crash.
