The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by dropping his lit cigarette between the seats and was focused on retrieving it. This distraction caused V1 to drift into the parking lane where V2 (the parked 1990 Plymouth Acclaim) was located, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's failure to see V2 prior to the crash further supports their responsibility for the accident.
