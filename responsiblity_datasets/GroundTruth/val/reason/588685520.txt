The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was already in the intersection and waiting to turn left. This suggests that Vehicle 1 may have run a red light or failed to stop at the intersection, causing the collision. Additionally, the fact that Vehicle 1 was redirected towards the southeast corner of the intersection and ultimately struck a raised metal fence and a highway sign post further indicates that Vehicle 1 was not in proper control and failed to avoid the collision.
