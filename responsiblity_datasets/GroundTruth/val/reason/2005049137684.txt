The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2 without taking any evasive action. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, which is a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that his view was obstructed by a large SUV in the third northbound lane, but it is the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to ensure that it is safe to do so. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to yield the right of way and not taking appropriate action to avoid the collision.
