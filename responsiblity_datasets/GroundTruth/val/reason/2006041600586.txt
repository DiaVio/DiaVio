The reason for this is that V1 experienced a right rear tire blowout, which caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The driver stated that he felt the tire blowout and the vehicle start to lose control, but he was unable to regain control and ended up colliding with both the left concrete wall and the right side guardrail. Additionally, it was noted during the vehicle inspection that the right rear tire had complete tread separation and was worn in several areas with exposed threads. This indicates that the tire was in a deficient condition and likely contributed to the blowout and subsequent loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle after the tire blowout and the presence of a deficient tire.
