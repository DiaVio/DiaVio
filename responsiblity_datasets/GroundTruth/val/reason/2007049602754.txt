The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. V2, on the other hand, was traveling straight in the second lane of the westbound lanes and had the right-of-way. V2 stated that they saw V1 approaching the intersection but assumed that V1 would yield, which was a false assumption. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right-of-way and make a safe left turn resulted in the collision with V2.
