The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The driver briefly looked to his right but did not see any vehicles coming. This indicates an inadequate surveillance and recognition error on the part of Vehicle 1. Additionally, Vehicle 1 was in a hurry and late for work, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the situation. The driver also mentioned that the intersection had poor distance visibility, suggesting that there may be issues with the intersection design. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to ensure a safe turn, regardless of the visibility conditions. Vehicle 2 (the Nissan Frontier) attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, but was unsuccessful. While Vehicle 2 may have been traveling at the posted speed limit and had its vision obstructed by the stopped vehicle in the adjacent lane, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 for not properly assessing the situation and causing the collision.
