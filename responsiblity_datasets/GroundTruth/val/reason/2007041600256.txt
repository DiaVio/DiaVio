The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about V2's intentions. Despite seeing the light change from a green arrow to a solid green light, the driver of V1 assumed that V2 would still proceed through the intersection. This false assumption led the driver of V1 to hit the gas and follow V2, resulting in a collision when V2 slowed down to yield the right of way. Additionally, V1 was cited for the crash and also had no proof of insurance, indicating a lack of responsibility and compliance with traffic regulations. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to properly assess the situation make them primarily responsible for the accident.
