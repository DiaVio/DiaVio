The reason for this is that V2 lost control and veered left into the median, crossing over into the left southbound lane where V1 was traveling. V1 was unable to avoid V2 and collided with its right side. As a result, V3, which was behind V1, also collided with V1 from the rear. Therefore, the initial loss of control by V2 and its subsequent entry into the wrong lane caused the chain of events leading to the accident.
