The reason for this determination is that V1 traveled off the road on the right side and struck the metal pole with railroad crossing crossbucks and flashing red signal lights. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision. Since there is no information available about the driver or any other factors that may have contributed to the crash, it can be concluded that the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
