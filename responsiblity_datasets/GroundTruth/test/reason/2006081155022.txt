The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to brake on the wet road. This resulted in V1 sliding across the intersection and ultimately colliding with the metal utility pole.
