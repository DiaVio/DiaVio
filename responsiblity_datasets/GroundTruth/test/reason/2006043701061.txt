The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a series of steering movements in reaction to the merging non-contact vehicles, which ultimately led to the loss of control and the crash. The driver's overcompensation in steering caused V1 to rotate and travel off the road, resulting in the collision with the median wall. Additionally, a vehicle-related factor was also identified as a contributing factor to the crash. The left rear tire of V1 was significantly underinflated at 10 psi, well below the recommended inflation of 29 psi. This tire deficiency could have further compromised the vehicle's stability and handling, making it more susceptible to losing control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation and the vehicle-related factor of the underinflated tire.
