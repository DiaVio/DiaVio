The reason for this is that V1 was overtaking V2 (the 1990 Dodge Caravan) when it drifted to the right over the lane line and made contact with V2. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle while attempting to overtake another vehicle, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's vehicle rotated clockwise and struck the median wall, suggesting that V1's actions caused them to lose control and veer off the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control while overtaking another vehicle.
