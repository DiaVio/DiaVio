The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before changing lanes. This is evident from the fact that the driver of V1 did not see V2, which resulted in the front of V1 contacting the left rear of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for an illegal use of a left turn lane, indicating a violation of traffic rules. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within the speed limit and did not contribute to the critical pre-crash event. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
