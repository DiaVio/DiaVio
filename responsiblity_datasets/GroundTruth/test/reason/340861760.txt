The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it struck the back end of Vehicle 2 (V2), the Bluebird School Bus, from behind. V1 under-rode V2, indicating that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, V1's front end striking the back end of V2 suggests that V1 was not able to stop in time to avoid the collision, indicating a failure to exercise proper control and attention while driving.
