The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they entered the intersection on a red traffic control signal, assuming that V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) would stop. This illegal maneuver by V1 led to the collision with V2, who was making a left turn at the intersection. Additionally, the witness confirms that the traffic light was solid red for V1 as they entered the intersection, further supporting V1's responsibility for the accident.
