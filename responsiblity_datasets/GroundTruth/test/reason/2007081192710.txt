The driver of V2 failed to stop and collided with the rear of V1 (the 1998 Toyota Corolla sedan), initiating the chain of events that led to the subsequent collisions. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V2 should have been aware of V1's presence and taken appropriate action to avoid the collision. The driver-related factors of misjudgment of the gap/velocity of the other vehicle and inadequate surveillance were considered associative factors for V2, further supporting their responsibility for the accident.
