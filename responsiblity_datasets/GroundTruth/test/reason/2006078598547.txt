The driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which is a driver-related factor and the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to feeling drowsy at the beginning of the trip and had only 5 ½ hours of sleep the night before, which is below the recommended amount. Additionally, the driver had been driving for about 3 ½ hours on his way to a jobsite, indicating possible fatigue. Falling asleep at the wheel is a clear indication of driver negligence and responsibility for the accident.
