The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 attempted a left turn at the intersection, misjudging the gap or speed of V1. This decision error led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, V2 had been licensed for less than a year, indicating a lack of experience and potentially contributing to the misjudgment. It is important to note that V1 was traveling above the posted speed limit for the school zone, but since V2's decision error was the critical reason for the accident, V2 bears the primary responsibility.
