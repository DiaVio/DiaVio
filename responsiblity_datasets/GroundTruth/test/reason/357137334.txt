The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that it had just completed a right turn onto the road from an intersecting roadway. As a result, V2 was likely still in the process of merging into the southbound lane when the collision occurred. This suggests that V2 may not have fully established its position in the lane, potentially contributing to the accident.
