The driver of V1 made an unsafe lane change without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane. This is evident from the driver's statement that she activated her turn signal, changed lanes, and then was hit from behind. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 encroached into the adjacent lane without proper observation. Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving on a learner's permit and was not in compliance with the restrictions of the permit. This inexperience may have contributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance and decision-making. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's unsafe lane change and inadequate surveillance.
