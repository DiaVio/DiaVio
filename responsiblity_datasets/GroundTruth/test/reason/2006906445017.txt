The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 failed to notice V2 approaching the intersection, even though the witness who was stopped next to V1 at the traffic light was able to see V2 and stopped to avoid a collision. V1 should have been more cautious and aware of their surroundings, especially considering the sunglare and possible sightline restriction caused by the witness's stopped vehicle.
