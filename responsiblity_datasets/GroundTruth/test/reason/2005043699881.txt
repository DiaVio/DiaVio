The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by glancing down at his radio and not noticing that the traffic lights had changed. This distraction caused V1 to continue through the intersection while the light was red for north/south traffic. As a result, V1 collided with Vehicle two (V2) and then struck Vehicle three (V3) as well.
