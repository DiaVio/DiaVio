The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to drifting left and hitting a pole before coming back onto the roadway. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the driver stated that he fainted due to palpitations and atrial fibrillation, a pre-existing medical condition. This medical condition likely contributed to the driver's loss of control and subsequent crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the influence of the driver's pre-existing medical condition.
