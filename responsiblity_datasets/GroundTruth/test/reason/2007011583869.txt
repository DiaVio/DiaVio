The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions and the curve/turn of the exit ramp. This is evident from the driver's statement that the car started to fishtail, indicating a loss of control due to excessive speed. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer left and right to regain control suggests that she was not able to properly navigate the curve at the speed she was traveling. Furthermore, the driver's late departure for work and potential overcompensation when trying to take evasive action could have contributed to the loss of control. The fact that she had only purchased the vehicle 10 days prior to the crash may have also played a role, as she may not have been fully accustomed to its handling characteristics. Overall, the driver's failure to adjust her speed to the wet conditions and the curve/turn of the exit ramp, as well as potential inexperience with the vehicle, make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
