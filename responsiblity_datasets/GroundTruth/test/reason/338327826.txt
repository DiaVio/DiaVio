The reason for this is that V1 departed the right side of the roadway, sideswiped a guardrail, re-entered the roadway, and then departed the left side, ultimately impacting an embankment. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 was unrestrained suggests a lack of adherence to safety measures, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
