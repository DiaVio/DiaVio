The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to V2 (the driver of the Mercury Villager) and failed to maintain a safe distance. This is evident from V1's statement that she had been maintaining a distance of approximately ten to twenty feet from V2 for a few miles. When V2 suddenly slammed on his brakes, V1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended V2. Additionally, the police report states that the driver of V1 failed to give full time and attention, indicating that she was not paying enough attention to the road and the actions of the vehicles ahead of her. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to following too closely and inattention.
