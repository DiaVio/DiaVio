The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle drifting off the road and ultimately colliding with the bridge abutment and guardrail. The driver's fatigue and inexperience, as well as the fact that she admitted to being tired at the time of the accident, contribute to her responsibility for the crash.
