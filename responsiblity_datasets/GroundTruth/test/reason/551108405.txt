The reason for this is that V1 was passing another vehicle prior to the curve and returned to the lane of travel as the curve left in the roadway started. V1 then began to depart the roadway to the right and started to rotate counterclockwise on the roadway shoulder. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control while navigating the curve, resulting in the vehicle leaving the roadway and ultimately colliding with multiple trees.
