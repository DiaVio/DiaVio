The reason for V1's responsibility is that it either tried to change lanes or hydroplaned into lane four, impacting V2 on the right side. V1 then cut in front of V2 and entered lane five before leaving the scene. This action of changing lanes or losing control and impacting another vehicle caused the chain reaction that led to the subsequent collisions involving V2, V3, and V4.
