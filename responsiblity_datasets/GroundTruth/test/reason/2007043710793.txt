The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, leading to the vehicle veering off the road and ultimately crashing into trees. The driver's blackout or sleep episode is identified as the critical reason for the accident. Additionally, the driver's participation in strenuous activities prior to the crash, such as moving furniture and renovating his house, may have contributed to his fatigue and increased the likelihood of falling asleep while driving. The underinflated tires of V1 also played a role as a tire/wheel deficiency factor.
