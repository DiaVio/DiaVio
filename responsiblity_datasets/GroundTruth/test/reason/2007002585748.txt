The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted while trying to change the CD in his vehicle. This internal distraction caused V1 to drift off the roadway, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the wet roads and snowy weather may have contributed to the loss of control, but the primary cause was the driver's distraction.
