The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were driving too fast for the conditions. The roadway was wet, and there was water accumulated in the sag. Additionally, the critical per-crash event was coded as V1 losing control due to poor road conditions, specifically a water puddle on the roadway. This suggests that V1 did not adjust their speed appropriately for the slick roadway and the accumulation of water, resulting in the loss of directional control of the vehicle.
