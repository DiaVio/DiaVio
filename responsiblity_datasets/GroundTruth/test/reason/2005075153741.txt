The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the sun hitting his left outside mirror, which caused him to be momentarily blinded. As a result of this distraction, V1 veered over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, entered the left turn lane for eastbound traffic, and collided head-on with V2 (the 2003 Kenworth Aerocab T600 pulling one trailer). V1's distraction and subsequent improper lane change directly led to the accident.
