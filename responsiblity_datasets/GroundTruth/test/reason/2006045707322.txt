The reason for this is that Vehicle #1, an unknown tractor pulling a tanker trailer, rear-ended Vehicle #2 in the westbound lanes of the interstate. Vehicle #1 then continued on without stopping, indicating a hit and run situation. Although the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was coded as an unknown driver error, wet roads and rain were also factors in the crash for Vehicle #1. On the other hand, Vehicle #2, a 1996 Dodge Intrepid, was traveling in lane two of the interstate and was rear-ended by Vehicle #1. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #2 was another vehicle in the same direction with a higher speed. However, the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors for Vehicle #2 included having only 2 millimeters of tread on the tires, as well as rain and wet roads. Overall, Vehicle #1's actions of rear-ending Vehicle #2 and then leaving the scene make it primarily responsible for the crash.
