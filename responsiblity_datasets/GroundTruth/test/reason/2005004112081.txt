The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 was turning left at the intersection while V1 was going straight with a green light. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2's statement that he thought V1 was stopped indicates a lack of attention and awareness on his part.
