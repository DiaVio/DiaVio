The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver stated his brakes failed when he tried to turn right on his normal route to work. Despite the brake failure, the driver attempted to continue driving and even tried to use the emergency brake, which also did not work. This indicates that V1 was aware of the brake failure but still chose to proceed with the journey. Additionally, the driver of V1 started weaving left and right in an attempt to slow down the vehicle, which suggests a lack of control over the vehicle. This erratic behavior could have potentially endangered other road users. Furthermore, a witness traveling in front of V1 saw the vehicle weaving in the roadway before it ran off the road, indicating that V1's lack of control was evident to others on the road. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to address the brake failure issue and the subsequent loss of control over the vehicle.
