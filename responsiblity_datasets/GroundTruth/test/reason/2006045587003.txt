The driver of V1 was distracted by a non-driving activity (eating/drinking) and drifted off the right side of the road. Despite having plenty of time to bring the vehicle to a controlled stop, the driver failed to apply any brakes after departing the roadway. This indicates an inadequate avoidance maneuver. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the ditch was too deep for her to return to the roadway, suggesting a lack of proper control and awareness of the surroundings. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, failure to drive within lanes, and inadequate avoidance maneuver.
