The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it entered the intersection intending to turn left, but failed to yield the right of way to V2, the northbound pickup truck. V2 had observed V1's maneuver and applied the brakes, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. However, V1's failure to yield resulted in the near side impact with the front of V2, causing the accident.
