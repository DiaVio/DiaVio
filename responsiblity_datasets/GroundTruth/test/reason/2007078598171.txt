The reason for this is that V2 traveled off the right side of the roadway and then back on the roadway in an attempt to make a u-turn, crossing into the westbound lane where it was struck by the front of V1. This action by V2 indicates a failure to yield the right of way and a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that he never saw V1 prior to the crash, suggesting a lack of awareness and attention on the part of V2. While V1 attempted to steer right and apply the brakes to avoid the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for making an unsafe maneuver and failing to properly observe the roadway before attempting the u-turn.
