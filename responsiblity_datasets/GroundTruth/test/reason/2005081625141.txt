The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 (the 2000 Cadillac Catera sedan) when V2 had to brake and decelerate due to another vehicle making a sudden left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by the two passengers in the rear seats, which further contributed to the accident.
