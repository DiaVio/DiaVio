The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 departed the left side of the roadway, initiated a right steering maneuver but lost control, and then traveled across all the southbound travel lanes, ultimately striking Vehicle 1's left front corner. This initial departure from the roadway and subsequent loss of control by Vehicle 2 led to the collision with Vehicle 1, causing the rollover event.
