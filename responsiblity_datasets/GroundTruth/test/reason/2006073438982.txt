The reason for V1's responsibility is that it veered to the right, jumped the curb, and struck a light pole. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the fact that two young females exited V1 and left the scene suggests that they may have been attempting to flee the scene of the accident, which further indicates their responsibility. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control and subsequent actions.
