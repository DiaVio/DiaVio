The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, as indicated by the driver's admission of glancing at a map and being unfamiliar with the area. V2 also claimed that the crest in the road prevented him from seeing V1 approaching, but the pictures provided show that the crest was 61 meters away and did not block his view of V1. Additionally, V2 did not take any avoidance measures and collided with V1, causing the crash.
