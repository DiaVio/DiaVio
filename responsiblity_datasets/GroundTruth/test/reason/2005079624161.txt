The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the left lane (lane one) and encroached over the left lane line, impacting the right side of V1 (the 1997 Ford Lincoln Town Car) as it was making a left turn. V2's encroachment into the left turn lane indicates a failure to maintain their lane and exercise proper caution while driving.
