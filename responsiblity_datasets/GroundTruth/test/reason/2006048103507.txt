The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while driving, which is a driver-related factor. This caused V1 to travel off the road and ultimately collide with multiple trees. Additionally, the blood test conducted at the hospital indicated the presence of Benzodiazepines in the driver's system, which could have contributed to his drowsiness and impaired driving ability.
