The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road while stopped at the intersection. She was busy eating lunch and conversing with her friends, which caused her to miss the fact that it was not clear to make the left turn. As a result, she pulled out into the intersection and was struck by V2 (the 2006 Nissan Xterra) that was approaching in the southbound lane. V2, on the other hand, was traveling at the speed limit and going straight, following the rules of the road. The driver of V2 had the right of way and was not expected to anticipate V1's sudden movement into the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to yield the right of way.
