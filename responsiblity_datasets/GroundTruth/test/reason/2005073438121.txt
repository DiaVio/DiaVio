The driver of V1 made several critical errors that led to the crash. Firstly, the driver was traveling at a speed much higher than the recommended exit ramp speed, which made it difficult for him to navigate the curve. Secondly, the driver made a last-minute decision to take the exit ramp without being familiar with the roadway or knowing exactly where he was going. This lack of familiarity and decision-making under pressure caused him to miss the correct exit and attempt to take the wrong ramp. Additionally, the driver was internally distracted by conversation with two passengers, which likely affected his focus and ability to react appropriately. Lastly, the driver's inexperience, having only been licensed for two years and having been involved in a previous crash just three weeks prior, suggests a lack of proper driving skills and judgment. Overall, the combination of excessive speed, poor decision-making, distraction, and inexperience makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
