The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling in the right southbound through lane and intended to cross through the intersection. It collided with the right side plane of Vehicle 1 (the 2008 GMC Sierra 2500HD pick-up truck) which was in the left turn lane, indicating that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1.
