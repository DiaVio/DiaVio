The reason for this is that V1 moved left into the center painted median area in order to pass a non-contact vehicle, and in doing so, crossed over the painted median and traveled into the lane of travel of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2011 Toyota Highlander. This resulted in a head-on collision between V1 and V2.
