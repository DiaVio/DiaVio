The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver suddenly steered the vehicle to the left, possibly in response to a perceived hazard. This maneuver caused V1 to leave the travel lane, cross the paved median shoulder, and strike the concrete divider. The sudden and unexpected movement by V1 created a hazardous situation and ultimately led to the subsequent collisions with Vehicle 2 (V2) and Vehicle 3 (V3).
