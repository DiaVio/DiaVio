The driver of V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit on a wet road when he encountered a lounge chair obstructing his lane. While attempting to avoid the chair, the driver hit the brakes, causing them to lock up and lose control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 spinning counterclockwise and colliding with the concrete barrier wall. The driver's overcompensation, as identified as the critical reason for the crash, played a significant role in the loss of control. Additionally, the driver's sleep pattern, having been awake for 23 hours, may have impaired his judgment and reaction time. Although the presence of the lounge chair in the roadway was a contributing factor, the driver's actions and failure to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
