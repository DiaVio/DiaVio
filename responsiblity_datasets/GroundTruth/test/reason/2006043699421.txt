The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated after swerving to avoid the oncoming vehicle that drifted into their lane. This overcompensation led to V1 losing control, departing the roadway, and ultimately crashing into a pile of rocks and a mailbox. The driver's overcompensation is considered a driver-related factor, which is the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the wet roads and rainy weather were coded as associated factors, meaning they contributed to the crash but were not the primary cause. These factors likely made the road more slippery and reduced traction, making it more difficult for V1 to regain control after swerving. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation, while the wet roads and rainy weather were contributing factors.
