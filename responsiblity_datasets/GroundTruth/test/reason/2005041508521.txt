The driver of V1 failed to stop for the red light and had inadequate surveillance, as he failed to look ahead to either side as he approached the intersection. Additionally, there was a view obstruction caused by shrubbery partially blocking the view of approaching westbound traffic. These factors contributed to the driver of V1 not being aware of the approaching V2 and ultimately causing the collision.
