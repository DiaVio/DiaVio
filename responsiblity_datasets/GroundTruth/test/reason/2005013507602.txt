The driver of V1 admitted to not looking to the left to see if traffic was clear before attempting to complete the left turn. This indicates a failure to exercise proper surveillance and caution while making the turn. As a result, V1 pulled out into the intersection without ensuring it was safe to do so, leading to the collision with V2.
