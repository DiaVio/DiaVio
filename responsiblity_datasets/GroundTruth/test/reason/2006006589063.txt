The driver of Vehicle one admitted to mistakenly hitting the gas pedal instead of the brake, resulting in a loss of control and acceleration to a high speed of 145 kmph (90 mph). This caused Vehicle one to collide with Vehicle two (1994 Volkswagen Jetta), which was legally parked on the south side of the roadway. Vehicle one then continued to travel and collided with Vehicle three (Freightliner mail truck), which was stopped at the intersection for a red light. Finally, Vehicle one collided with Vehicle four (1994 Toyota Corolla), which was also legally parked on the south side of the roadway. The driver of Vehicle one's poor directional control and performance error, combined with the distraction of conversing with a passenger, contributed to the crash. Despite being an experienced driver, the driver of Vehicle one demonstrated a lack of alertness during the interview. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash.
