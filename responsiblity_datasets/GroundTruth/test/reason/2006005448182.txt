The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 departed from her travel lane and entered the parking lane, resulting in the collision with V2 (1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan). This indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lane. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event coded for V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," further supporting V1's responsibility. Factors such as the driver of V1 being asleep at the time of the crash, as indicated by the Critical Reason coded as "sleeping, that is, actually asleep," and the associated factors of fatigue, use of prescription narcotic analgesic and tranquilizer, and illness contribute to the driver's impaired ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the impaired condition she was in at the time of the incident.
