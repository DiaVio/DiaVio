The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the brake system of the vehicle lost pressure and failed, causing the driver to be unable to slow down or stop at the intersection. Additionally, the driver reported having a migraine and difficulty driving due to oncoming headlights, which may have impaired her ability to react to the brake failure effectively. Furthermore, the vehicle had multiple deficiencies, including issues with the brakes, transmission, and tires, which could have contributed to the accident.
