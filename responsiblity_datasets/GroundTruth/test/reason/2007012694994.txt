The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle on the rain slick roadway while merging onto the eastbound interstate. The driver ignored the flashing advisory sign on the entrance ramp and was traveling too fast for the conditions, resulting in the vehicle rotating and colliding with V2 (the 2001 Frightliner Semi tractor trailer). V1 then continued to rotate and cross multiple lanes of the eastbound interstate before coming to a final rest. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in its lane and did not encroach into V1's lane. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control and adjust speed for the conditions makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
