The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 observed V2 (2000 Jeep Cherokee) traveling through the intersection from her right and instinctively steered left, resulting in the front of V1 striking the left side of V2. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, causing the collision.
