The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was making a left turn at an intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. - The critical reason for V1's actions was an unknown driver error, indicating that the driver made a mistake while turning left. - Additionally, V1 had inadequate tread depth on the right front and right rear tires, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle properly. - It is also worth noting that the driver of V1 was unlicensed and cited for DWI, suggesting that they were operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 (the Dodge Dakota pickup) is primarily responsible for the accident.
