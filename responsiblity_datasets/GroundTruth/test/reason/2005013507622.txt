The witness stated that V1 was encroaching on the travel lane occupied by V2 (the white pick-up) and ultimately made contact with V2. V1 deviated from its original travel lane, crossed the center lane, and traveled across the adjacent lane, resulting in the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a recognition error by the unknown driver. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly recognize the position of their vehicle in relation to the lane boundaries, leading to the encroachment and subsequent collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's recognition error and failure to maintain their lane.
