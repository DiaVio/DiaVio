The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver reportedly fainted while approaching the intersection. As a result, V1 departed the roadway, crossed the intersection, and continued traveling off-road before ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's loss of consciousness and inability to remember the crash indicate that they were unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the sequence of events that caused the crash.
