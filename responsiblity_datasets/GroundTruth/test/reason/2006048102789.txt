The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, despite being aware that her vehicle did not stop well on wet roads. This resulted in V1 sliding on the wet road and colliding with the back of V2, who had properly stopped to make a left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust her speed to the conditions of the road and her knowledge of her vehicle's limitations on wet roads makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
