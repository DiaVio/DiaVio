The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to miscalculating the curve and traveling too fast for the wet roadway conditions. As a result, the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to make a right turn, causing V1 to collide with the bridge rails and raised curb. The driver's negligence in not adjusting their speed to match the road conditions and misjudging the curve led to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
