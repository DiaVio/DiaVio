The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a last-minute decision to turn left at the intersection, switching from lane 2 to lane 3. This sudden lane change and left turn in front of oncoming traffic (V2) violated the basic driving law that states that traffic turning left must yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 would stop to avoid a crash, misjudging the velocity of V2 and thinking that V2 was traveling slower than it actually was. Additionally, a witness traveling behind V2 confirmed that V1 was moving from lane to lane before the crash and made the left turn right in front of V2. The witness stated that V2 was traveling at a reasonable speed and tried to avoid striking V1 by locking up the brakes. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way, making a last-minute lane change and left turn in front of oncoming traffic, and the false assumption of V2's actions make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
