The reason for this is that V1 departed the right side of the roadway after successfully negotiating a right curve. It then traveled on the shoulder before descending an embankment and ultimately collided with a wooden fence post and the ground. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
