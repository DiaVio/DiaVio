The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the closed, right eastbound lane for unknown reasons, and then steered back to the left, ultimately departing the left side of the roadway. As a result, Vehicle 1 struck the concrete barrier wall before colliding with the rear of Vehicle 2. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and failed to stay within their designated lane, leading to the collision.
