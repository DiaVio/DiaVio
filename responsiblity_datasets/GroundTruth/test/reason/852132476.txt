The reason for this is that V1 lost control in the curve, crossed the opposite lane, and departed the roadway. V1 then impacted the end of a guard rail, rotated down a steep embankment, and rolled into trees. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle in the snowy and slushy conditions, leading to the accident.
