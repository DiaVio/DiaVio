The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to crossing over into the oncoming lane due to a momentary distraction of looking down to change a CD. This action resulted in Vehicle #1 being on the wrong side of the road and colliding head-on with Vehicle #2. Although Vehicle #2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Impala) attempted to steer left to avoid the crash, the impact occurred just north of the lane line, indicating that Vehicle #1 was attempting to return to its original lane. The witness also substantiated that Vehicle #1 crossed the centerline. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and driving on the wrong side of the road directly caused the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
