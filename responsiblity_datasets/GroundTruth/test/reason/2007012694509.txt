The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way and turned with an obstructed view. Despite seeing the large pick-up in lane two of the westbound lanes of travel, V1 did not wait for the truck to move or give it enough time to make a move. V1 proceeded to make a left turn across westbound lane one without ensuring that it was clear, resulting in a collision with V2 (the driver of the 2004 Saab 9/3 convertible) who was traveling in lane one. V2, on the other hand, was not primarily responsible for the accident. Although V2 was distracted by passengers in the vehicle, V2 was driving within their lane and had the right of way. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by decelerating, braking, and steering left, but was unable to avoid the collision with V1. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and turn with an obstructed view.
