The driver of V1 admitted that she did not adequately survey the intersection before making her left turn. She stated that she thought the other car was allowing her to turn left, but she did not notice V2 (the Buick Rendezvous) approaching. This lack of surveillance and failure to notice the oncoming vehicle led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking with her passengers, which likely contributed to her inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was simply traveling through the intersection and did not have a chance to react to V1's sudden left turn. No critical reason was coded to the driver of V2, indicating that their actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and distraction.
