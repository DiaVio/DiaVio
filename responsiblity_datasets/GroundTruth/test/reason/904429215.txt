The reason for this is that V2 was traveling east in lane one and failed to yield the right of way at the intersection controlled by stop signs. V1, the 2011 GMC Sierra Denali K2500 four door heavy duty large pickup, was traveling south in lane one and entered the intersection with the right of way. V1 attempted to brake, but V2 still impacted the right side of V1's pickup bed. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and impact with V1 caused the crash, resulting in V1's departure from the roadway and subsequent impact with the ditch.
