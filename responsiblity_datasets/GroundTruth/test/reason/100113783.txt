The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 made sudden and erratic steering maneuvers, initially attempting to change lanes to the left and then abruptly steering back to the right and left again. These actions caused V1 to veer off the roadway, cross the paved median shoulder, and collide with the concrete center divider. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the resulting impact with the barrier indicate that V1 was the primary cause of the accident.
