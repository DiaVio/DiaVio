The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 78-year-old male, departed its travel lane over the center lane line and entered the oncoming lane, resulting in a collision with V2. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side, indicating that V1 was not in its designated lane at the time of the crash. The critical reason for V1 was coded as an unknown driver error, suggesting that the driver of V1 made an error that led to the departure from the travel lane. On the other hand, V2, driven by a 68-year-old female, stated that she saw V1 cross into her lane and braked but was unable to avoid the crash. The critical precrash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction over the left lane line. This indicates that V2 was in its designated lane and V1 encroached into it. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's error in departing the travel lane and encroaching into the oncoming lane, resulting in a collision with V2.
