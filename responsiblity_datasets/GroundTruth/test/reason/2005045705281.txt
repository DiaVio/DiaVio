The driver of Vehicle #1 swerved left to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle merging from the right on-ramp. This action caused Vehicle #1 to cross the left lane and ultimately collide with the divider wall. The critical pre-crash event was the encroachment of another vehicle from an adjacent lane, and the critical reason for this event was a performance error - overcompensation by the driver of Vehicle #1. The fact that the driver is an epileptic and takes medication for the condition was not a contributing factor to the crash.
