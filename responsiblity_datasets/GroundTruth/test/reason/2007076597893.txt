The driver of V1 failed to stop for a red light at the intersection, which resulted in the collision with V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe). This failure to obey traffic signals and inadequate surveillance (not looking or not seeing) on the part of the driver of V1 led to the initial impact and subsequent chain of events.
