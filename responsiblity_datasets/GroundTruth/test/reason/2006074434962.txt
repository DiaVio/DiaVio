The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1 (the driver of the Chevrolet Cavalier) was traveling straight in their lane and had the right of way. V2 failed to yield and turned left in front of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V2 was coded as a driver-related factor: internal distraction. This suggests that the driver of V2 may have been distracted by talking to his wife, which could have contributed to his failure to yield and the subsequent collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
