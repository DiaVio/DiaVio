The reason for this is that V2 ran off the roadside to the right, then attempted to maneuver back onto the roadway by crossing the center lane line into the westbound traffic. This action caused V2 to collide with V1 (the 2010 Hyundai Accent sedan) on the westbound shoulder, resulting in serious injuries to the driver of V1.
