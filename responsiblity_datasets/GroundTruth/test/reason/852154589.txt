The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve, resulting in a clockwise yaw. V1 then traveled off the roadway, scraping along the curb and swiping a tree in the planting strip. The impact with the tree caused the deployment of the driver's seat back mounted side airbag. V1 continued sliding and ultimately came to rest on the sidewalk. Therefore, the actions and loss of control by the driver of V1 led to the crash and subsequent injuries to the 16-year-old male driver.
