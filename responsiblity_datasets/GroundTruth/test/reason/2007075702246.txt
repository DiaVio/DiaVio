The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they turned left from the private driveway with an obstructed view. V1 stated that there were two vehicles in the westbound right turn lane, which obstructed their view. Despite this obstruction, V1 accelerated to make the left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This failure to exercise caution and properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's decision to turn left with an obstructed view and failure to yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
