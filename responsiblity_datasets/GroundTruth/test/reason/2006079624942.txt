The driver of V1 stated that he could not see V2 as he negotiated the curve and only realized that V2 was ahead after crossing the intersection. This indicates that V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as "too fast for curve/turn," suggesting that V1 was driving at an unsafe speed for the conditions of the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and driving too fast for the curve.
