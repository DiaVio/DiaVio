The driver lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, resulting in a counter-clockwise yaw and crossing the centerline. This indicates a lack of proper control and possibly negligent driving on the part of the driver. The subsequent collision with a large rock and the tripping and rolling of the vehicle further suggest a failure to maintain control. The driver's severe injuries and the fact that they were unrestrained also indicate a lack of responsibility in ensuring their own safety. The right-front passenger, who was wearing a three-point belt, suffered incapacitating injuries, which could suggest that the driver's actions contributed to the severity of the passenger's injuries. Overall, the driver's loss of control and failure to maintain control of the vehicle, as well as their lack of restraint, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
