The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one, a sixteen-year-old male, was unlicensed and had never received any driver training. Additionally, he had only driven this vehicle once prior to the crash and had never driven on the roadway where the crash occurred. These factors indicate a lack of experience and familiarity with the vehicle and the road conditions. Furthermore, the driver stated that the traction control was turned off, which likely contributed to his loss of control when attempting to turn right into the alley. This suggests a failure to exercise ordinary skill in controlling the vehicle. Overall, the driver's lack of experience, unfamiliarity with the road, and failure to control the vehicle properly make Vehicle one primarily responsible for the crash.
