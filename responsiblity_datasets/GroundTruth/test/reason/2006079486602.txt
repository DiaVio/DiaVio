The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before executing the left turn. The driver admitted to not seeing V2's approach and only became aware of the situation when he heard the screeching of tires. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. V2 (the driver of the Ford Focus sedan) reported that he saw V1 intending to turn left but assumed that V1 would remain stopped and allow him to pass. While V2's assumption may have contributed to the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the oncoming traffic and failing to yield the right of way to V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to a recognition error and inadequate surveillance while executing the left turn.
