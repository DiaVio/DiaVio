The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was at a stop in the right eastbound lane and intended to travel through the intersection. However, it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2000 Ford Windstar minivan) which was already in the intersection and traveling northbound. The collision occurred when Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck the front left/left front of Vehicle 2.
