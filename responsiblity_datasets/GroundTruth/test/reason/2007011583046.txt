The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended V2. The driver of V1 stated that traffic had slowed down and then started speeding up again, but when V2 started braking, V1 was unable to stop in time. This indicates that the driver of V1 was following too closely and/or not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a violation of traffic laws and a common cause of rear-end collisions. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that he was not in a hurry and was familiar with the road and the vehicle. This suggests that the driver of V1 should have been more attentive and prepared for the changing traffic conditions, especially during rush hour. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance and respond appropriately to the actions of V2, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
