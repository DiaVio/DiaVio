The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control on the icy road conditions, causing it to depart the roadway and collide with a ditch/culvert and a mailbox post. The driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident. Additionally, it is noted that the right front passenger of Vehicle 1 was unrestrained, which may have contributed to the severity of their injuries.
