The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, 80kmph (50 mph), which was twice the posted speed limit for the roadway. Additionally, the driver crossed the yellow lines on the left while negotiating a right-hand curve, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. The driver's overcompensation in steering further contributed to the crash. These actions demonstrate a lack of caution and disregard for the conditions of the roadway, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
