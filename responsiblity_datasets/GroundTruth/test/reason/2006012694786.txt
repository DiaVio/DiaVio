The driver of V1 admitted to not looking far enough ahead before making the left turn and did not have enough clearance. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. V2 (the Ford Escort LX) was traveling in its designated lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that the vehicle in front of him changed lanes and stopped with its left turn signal on, indicating an intention to turn left. V2 was not aware that V1 was turning into his lane until the collision occurred. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly assess the situation and ensure there was enough clearance before making the left turn.
