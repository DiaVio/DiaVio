The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 was attempting to pass V1 on the right at a high rate of speed, which is a dangerous and illegal maneuver. This indicates a lack of proper control and judgment on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, the fact that V2's left front tire was the wrong size and all tires had low tread depth suggests a lack of maintenance and further contributes to the driver's poor control of the vehicle.
