The reason for this is that V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead. The driver of V1 was looking to the right to change lanes and when she looked back, her vehicle collided with the rear of V2 (the 2002 Mercedes Benz C 320). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and did not react in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was an inexperienced driver, having only been driving for six months, which may have contributed to her lack of awareness and ability to react appropriately in this situation.
