The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. The non-contact vehicle entered the intersection from a stop sign and did not yield the right of way to V1. However, V1 was driving at a speed of 72 kmph (16 kmph over the speed limit), which hindered her ability to react in time and avoid the collision. Additionally, the presence of a large tent on the northwest corner initially obstructed V1's view of the non-contact vehicle, further contributing to the lack of caution. In summary, V1's excessive speed and failure to adjust her driving behavior to the road conditions and potential hazards make her primarily responsible for the accident.
