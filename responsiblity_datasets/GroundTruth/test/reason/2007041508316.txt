The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 passed out behind the wheel, relinquishing control of the vehicle. This was due to a mixture of strong painkillers and anti-depressants that the driver was taking. The driver's physical factors, including back problems and the medication he was taking, contributed to his loss of consciousness. Additionally, the driver was emotionally upset and in a hurry to find his girlfriend, which led to driver inattention. These factors, combined with the driver's incoherence and unconsciousness during the interview, indicate that he was not fit to operate a vehicle safely.
