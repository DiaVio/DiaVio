The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by talking on her cell phone, which caused her to not notice that V2 had slowed down in front of her. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to consuming alcohol before driving and being fatigued from working a double shift. These factors likely impaired her ability to react in a timely manner and maintain proper control of her vehicle. While V2 (the driver of the 1997 Honda Accord) also had contributing factors such as conversing with passengers and being unfamiliar with the road, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to her distracted and impaired state while driving.
