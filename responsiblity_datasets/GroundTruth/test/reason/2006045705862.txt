The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by turning left with an obstructed view. Despite not being able to see around the tractor-trailer that was slowing to turn, V1 proceeded with the left turn and crossed the northbound lanes of traffic. This decision error, combined with the driver's fatigue from working long hours and the influence of prescription painkillers, contributed to the accident. Additionally, the recognition error of not perceiving the impending problem due to traffic flow and the sightline restriction caused by the tractor-trailer further support V1's primary responsibility.
