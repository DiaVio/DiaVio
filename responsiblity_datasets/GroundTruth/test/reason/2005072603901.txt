The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to pay attention to the road ahead. The driver was ending a cellular phone conversation and then looked over his right shoulder to check for other emergency vehicles, taking his attention away from the road. When he redirected his attention forward, he noticed that Vehicle #2 (V2) had backed up and re-entered the lane, but it was too late for him to stop and avoid the collision. While V2 was involved in a backing up maneuver, the critical reason for the accident was the distraction and inattentiveness of the V1 driver. The use of a cellular phone and looking back at the previous crash scene contributed to the driver's failure to notice V2's movement and react in time to avoid the collision.
