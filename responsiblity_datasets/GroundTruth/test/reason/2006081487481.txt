The driver of V1 abruptly changed lanes and failed to maintain control of the vehicle while traveling on a wet roadway. The driver was traveling too fast for the conditions and attempted to make a sharp turn onto the off-ramp, resulting in the vehicle losing control and rolling over. The driver's aggressive driving, poor directional control, and overcompensation contributed to the collision.
