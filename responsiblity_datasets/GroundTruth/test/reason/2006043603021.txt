The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that the witness reported seeing the driver of V2 talking on a cell phone before the crash. This indicates that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road. Additionally, V2 never slowed down as it entered the intersection, suggesting a failure to yield the right of way to V1. Therefore, V2's distraction and failure to yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
