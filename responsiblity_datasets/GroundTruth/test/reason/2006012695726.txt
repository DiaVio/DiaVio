The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed (between 82-97 kmph or 51-60 mph) in congested traffic conditions. The witness statement confirms that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, which indicates a driver error. Additionally, V1 made an avoidance action by steering right but was unable to avoid colliding with V2. V2, on the other hand, was stopped at the stoplight and slowly began accelerating when she was hit from behind. There is no indication that V2 contributed to the crash or made any avoidance actions, as she did not see V1 prior to the collision. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to avoid the collision make them primarily responsible for the crash.
