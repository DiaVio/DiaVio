The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One experienced a blowout and partial tread separation in the right rear tire, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, it was noted that the driver had not properly maintained the tires, as the remaining tires had extremely high pressure, with one even exceeding 70 psi. This lack of tire upkeep and care knowledge contributed to the tire failure. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly maintain the tires, resulting in the blowout and subsequent loss of control.
