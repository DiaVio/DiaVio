The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a critical non-performance error, specifically a heart attack or other physical impairment that caused him to lose consciousness and lose control of the vehicle. This impairment led to V1 drifting off the road and ultimately crashing into the trees. Additionally, the driver's emotional state, as indicated by being upset over his girlfriend and self-harming prior to the crash, may have contributed to his physical impairment.
