The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 hit a puddle of standing water on the entrance ramp, causing it to hydroplane and lose control. This resulted in Vehicle #1 departing off the right side of the roadway and making contact with the concrete barrier. Subsequently, Vehicle #1 spun across the northbound lanes and collided with Vehicle #2 (2000 Volvo dump truck). Although Vehicle #2 was traveling at a speed of approximately 80 KMPH (50 MPH) in lane two, it was not involved in the first harmful event and did not contribute to the cause of the crash. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
