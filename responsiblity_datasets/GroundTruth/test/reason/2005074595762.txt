The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to yield the right of way when entering the primary roadway from the driveway. Despite seeing the approaching vehicle with its right turn signal on, V1 pulled out into the roadway and was struck by V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 showed signs of impatience and false assumption of the other driver's actions, indicating a lack of attentiveness and responsibility. V2 (the driver of the silver Chevrolet Malibu) also had some contributing factors, such as being unfamiliar with the rental car and not being sure of which turn signal was activated. However, V2 was driving in the correct lane and had the right of way, while V1 failed to yield, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
