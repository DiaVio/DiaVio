The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate evasive action. The driver of V1 stated that she braked hard with lockup when the non-contact vehicle came into her lane, but she did not steer to avoid the collision. This indicates that she only relied on braking as her evasive action, which was not sufficient to prevent the crash.
