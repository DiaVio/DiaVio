The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 misjudged the gap distance or the speed of Vehicle 2 while attempting to make a left turn. Despite having a yellow left turn arrow, the driver of Vehicle 1 stated that she thought she had plenty of time to make the turn. This misjudgment led to the collision with Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight through the intersection with the right-of-way. Additionally, there is no indication that the driver of Vehicle 2 contributed to the crash. She had the green light and did not brake until a crash was unavoidable. The driver of Vehicle 2 took appropriate avoidance actions and entered the intersection with the right-of-way. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap distance or other vehicle's speed.
