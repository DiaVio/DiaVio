The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at a red light and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2000 Buick Regal). V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and stop at the red light is a clear violation of traffic laws and demonstrates negligence on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and inexperienced, which further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident. On the other hand, V2 had the right of way as they entered the intersection on a green light. The driver of V2 assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, but this assumption does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to stop at the red light. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at a red light and their admitted distractions and inexperience.
