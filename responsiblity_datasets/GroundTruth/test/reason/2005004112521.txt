The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn in front of V2, which resulted in the collision. V1's driver admitted that she thought V2 was turning, which indicates a false assumption of other road users' actions. This false assumption led to V1's improper left turn, causing V2 to collide with the right side of V1. Although V2 attempted to swerve and brake to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe left turn without ensuring that it was clear to do so.
