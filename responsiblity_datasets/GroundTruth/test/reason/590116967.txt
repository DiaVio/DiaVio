The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling at a high velocity and failed to negotiate the left curve on the downhill grade. This resulted in V1 leaving the roadway, striking a fire hydrant, and then colliding with a concrete block/stucco wall. The driver's failure to control the vehicle and maintain proper speed for the curve led to the subsequent collision with the wooden utility pole, causing severe damage and injuries. Additionally, it is noted that neither the driver nor the front right seat passenger were wearing seat belts, which further contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
