The driver of V1 admitted to looking down for a moment, which caused his vehicle to initially leave the roadway. This indicates a lack of attention and distraction on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver's oversteering and overcompensation when attempting to return to the roadway and avoid oncoming traffic further contributed to the crash. The driver's actions of crossing the center double yellow lines and ultimately losing control of the vehicle demonstrate a failure to maintain proper control and stay within the designated lane. Furthermore, the driver was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph, which exceeds the posted speed limit of 64 kmph. This indicates that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, considering the downhill grade of greater than 2% and the need to navigate the roadway safely. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction, oversteering, overcompensation, failure to maintain control, and traveling too fast for the conditions.
