The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unrestrained, as confirmed by the vehicle's event data recorder (EDR) and the absence of loading evidence on the driver belt system. The lack of restraint use increases the likelihood of injury in a collision. Additionally, the driver's steering input and trajectory choices led to the vehicle striking a bush and subsequently impacting a large tree, resulting in moderate damage. The driver's actions and lack of restraint contributed to the severity of the accident and the resulting injuries.
