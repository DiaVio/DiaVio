The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Pre-crash Event of "This vehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions." - V1 ran off the road to the right and then overcompensated when trying to return to the road, causing the vehicle to cross the double-yellow line and enter the oncoming lane. - V1's inexperience as a driver, having only been driving for one year, was an associated factor. - V1 was likely in a hurry to get to work on time, which may have contributed to her driving too fast for the curve. - V1 was also suffering from work-related stress, which could have affected her ability to focus on the road. - The tires on V1's vehicle lacked adequate tread depth, which is a tire deficiency. - Additionally, there were roadway-related factors that contributed to the crash, such as the deteriorated road edge, inadequate left curve warning signs, and a roadway geometry problem. It is important to note that V2 (the driver of the 1999 Ford F-550) was not primarily responsible for the crash. V2 was traveling within their lane and was struck by V1, who crossed the double-yellow line into the oncoming lane.
