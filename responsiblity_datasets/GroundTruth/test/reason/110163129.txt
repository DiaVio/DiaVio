The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver of V1 made several critical errors that led to the rollover crash. Firstly, the driver steered into the center left turn lane to avoid a car slowing down to turn right, which was an improper maneuver. Secondly, the driver over-steered to the right, causing the vehicle to enter a clockwise yaw and lose control. Finally, V1 tripped on the soft shoulder, leading to the rollover. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle and made incorrect steering inputs, ultimately resulting in the rollover crash.
