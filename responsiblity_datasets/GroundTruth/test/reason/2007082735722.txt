The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions (ice) in the curve. This resulted in V1 spinning around clockwise and traveling into the northbound lanes, where it collided with V2 (the 2000 Chevy Malibu). V1's inadequate surveillance and speed too fast for the conditions also contributed to the accident.
