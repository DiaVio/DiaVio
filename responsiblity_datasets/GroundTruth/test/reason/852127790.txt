The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the westbound lane and failed to stop in time when traffic ahead began to stop. V2 locked up its brakes, swerved to the left, and crossed the centerline, resulting in a collision with Vehicle One (V1), the Hyundai Accent sedan. V1, on the other hand, was braking in its own lane before the impact, indicating that the driver of V1 was taking appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, the actions of V2, including failing to stop in time, locking up the brakes, and swerving into the opposite lane, demonstrate a lack of control and negligence, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
