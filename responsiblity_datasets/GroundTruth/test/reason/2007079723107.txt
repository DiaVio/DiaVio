The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made several errors that contributed to the crash. Firstly, the driver attempted to change lanes without properly checking for other vehicles in the adjacent lane, resulting in the need to abruptly steer to the right to avoid a collision. This sudden maneuver caused V1 to veer off the roadway. Additionally, the driver then overcompensated by abruptly steering to the left, which caused V1 to roll over multiple times and ultimately collide with a curb and a bush. Furthermore, the driver's fatigue, lack of corrective eyewear, and inadequate surveillance were associated factors in this crash. The driver admitted to feeling fatigued and being near-sighted without wearing corrective lenses, which likely impaired her ability to properly assess the situation and react appropriately. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 (the driver of the 2003 Jeep Liberty) is primarily responsible for the crash.
