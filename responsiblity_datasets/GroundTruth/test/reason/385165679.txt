The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 swerved to the right as it entered the toll booth area, crossed multiple travel lanes, and collided with various structures, including the end of an impact attenuator, the lateral guardrail face of the attenuator, the corner of a barrier wall, and ultimately the far right vertical barrier post. These actions indicate a loss of control by the driver of Vehicle 1, resulting in the severe frontal impact with the barrier post.
