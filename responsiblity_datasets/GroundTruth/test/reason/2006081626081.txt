The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions, specifically hydroplaning caused by the standing water on the roadway. It is mentioned that several other vehicles drove through the same area without losing control, indicating that the driver of V1 was likely going too fast for the wet road conditions.
