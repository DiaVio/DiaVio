The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not notice that V2 (the 1998 GMC Sierra 1500 pickup) had stopped in front of them. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, V1 stated that she applied the brakes but skidded and was unable to avoid the crash. This suggests that V1 was unable to react in time to the stopped vehicle in front of them, further supporting their responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain proper surveillance and avoid colliding with the stopped vehicle.
