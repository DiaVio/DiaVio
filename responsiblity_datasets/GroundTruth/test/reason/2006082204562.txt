The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes from lane three to lane two without maintaining a safe distance from V2 (the Chevrolet Impala). V1 braked with full lock-up and skidded into the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was assigned as an external distraction. The driver of V1 was looking for an opening in traffic to the left and right, which likely contributed to their failure to maintain a safe distance and avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's actions of changing lanes without maintaining a safe distance and being distracted by external factors make them primarily responsible for the accident.
