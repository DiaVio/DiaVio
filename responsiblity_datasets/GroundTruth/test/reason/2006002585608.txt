The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being coded as "too fast for curve." This suggests that the driver failed to adjust their speed appropriately for the curvature of the roadway, resulting in V1 driving off the right side of the road and ultimately colliding with a pole. Additionally, the driver's inexperience with the road, as they stated that they did not drive this roadway often, likely contributed to their inability to navigate the curve safely. This lack of familiarity with the road may have affected their judgment and ability to anticipate the curve's characteristics. Furthermore, the driver's internal distraction, as they had been conversing with the passenger and were not fully focused on the driving task, likely played a role in the crash. This distraction may have compromised their ability to react quickly and effectively to the presence of the deer, leading to the driver steering left and ultimately losing control of the vehicle. Lastly, it is worth noting that the driver was also cited for driving without a license, which further indicates a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic laws. Overall, the combination of excessive speed for the curve, inexperience with the road, internal distraction, and driving without a license makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
