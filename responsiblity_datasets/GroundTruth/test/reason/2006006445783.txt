The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it, resulting in an inadequate surveillance critical pre-crash event. The driver of V1 stated that he saw the police cruiser (V2) entering the intersection but was unable to avoid the collision. However, the police report contradicts this statement, indicating that the driver of V1 did see and hear the police lights and sirens but was still unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and respond to the presence of the police cruiser makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
