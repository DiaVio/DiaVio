The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted that she intended to turn right at the intersection but either failed to initiate the turn or did so very late. The location of impact and the statement from the driver of Vehicle #2 (the 1993 Ford Ranger pickup) support the conclusion that Vehicle #1 did not yield the right of way. Additionally, the police charged the driver of Vehicle #1 with failure to yield. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield at the intersection.
