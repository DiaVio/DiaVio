The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the roadway. The driver looked to the right at the vehicle slowing down in the number one lane, but then failed to notice the bicyclist directly in front of his vehicle. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to properly observe the road ahead. As a result, V1 collided with the bicyclist, causing the accident.
