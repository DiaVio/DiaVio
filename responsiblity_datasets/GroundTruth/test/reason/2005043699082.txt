The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 made a false assumption about the actions of Vehicle 1 (Ford F250). The driver of Vehicle 2 saw Vehicle 1 approaching the side street with its right-turn signal on and assumed that Vehicle 1 was turning right. As a result, the driver of Vehicle 2 turned his head forward and began to proceed ahead, without confirming the intentions of Vehicle 1. This false assumption and failure to properly assess the situation led to Vehicle 2 pulling forward into the intersection and colliding with the right rear of Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the crash.
