The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the turn. The driver of V1 stated that she checked for oncoming traffic but did not see any, and thought it was clear to turn. However, the investigation revealed that the driver's inadequate surveillance, possibly due to the side effects of the medications she was taking, led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the 1997 Ford Taurus GL) was traveling straight in its lane and had slowed down to observe the Jeep in the left turn lane. The driver of V2 stated that she had slowed down to see what the driver of the Jeep was going to do, as another vehicle had just made a left turn in front of the Jeep. However, at the last minute, the Jeep turned and there was no place for V2 to go, resulting in the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance while making a left turn, which led to the collision with V2.
