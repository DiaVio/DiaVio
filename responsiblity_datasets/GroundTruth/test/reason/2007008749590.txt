The driver of V1 was attempting to make a left-hand turn into a gas station from the eastbound lane. However, the driver failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic in the westbound lane and crossed over the left lane line into the path of V2 (the 2002 Volkswagen Beetle). This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and did not exercise proper caution while making the turn. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 was arrested for possession of an illegal substance at the crash scene. Although this information is not reflected in the police report, it suggests that the driver of V1 may have been impaired or distracted, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while attempting to make a left-hand turn.
