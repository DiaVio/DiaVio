The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by a vehicle passing him on the right, which caused him to misjudge the velocity of V2 (the 1995 Plymouth Neon) and not expect it to be disabled in front of him in the travel lane. This distraction led to V1's failure to notice V2 stopped in lane three and subsequently resulted in the collision between the front of V1 and the back of V2.
