The reason for this is that the 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer was involved in a moderate, 11 o'clock frontal impact with the 2010 Honda Civic driven by the 87-year-old female case occupant. This indicates that the Trailblazer was the striking vehicle, and therefore, it bears primary responsibility for the accident.
