The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, given the dark, unlit, rainy, and wet environment at dawn. - The driver of V1 admitted to being fatigued, having only had four hours of sleep the previous night. - V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle when the non-contact car ahead began braking, resulting in V1 sliding off the right side of the road and subsequently losing control. - V1's poor directional control and inability to keep the vehicle on the roadway after initiating an avoidance maneuver further contributed to the crash. Overall, V1's excessive speed, fatigue, and lack of control in response to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle make it primarily responsible for the accident.
