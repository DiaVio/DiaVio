The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit, which was 72 kmph (45 mph). The EDR data indicated that V2's pre-crash speed 5 seconds prior to impact was 91 kmph (57 mph). This excessive speed contributed to V2's inability to avoid the collision with V1, even after V1 accelerated in an attempt to avoid being struck. V2's failure to maintain a safe speed for the conditions and inability to steer around V1 resulted in the subsequent collisions with V3 and V4. Therefore, V2's excessive speed and failure to avoid the collision make them primarily responsible for the accident.
