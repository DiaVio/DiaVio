The driver of V1 admitted to waiting too long to merge safely, resulting in the front of V1 striking the leading edge of the guardrail. The witness traveling behind V1 confirmed that V1 attempted to turn right onto the ramp in front of them, indicating a failure to properly merge into the exit lane. The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," further supporting V1's responsibility. Additionally, the driver of V1 exhibited a driver-related recognition error of inattention, possibly due to factors such as long work hours, rotating shifts, and eight days since her last day off. The failure to wear required corrective lenses and the possible side effects of her prescribed birth control medication were also contributing factors.
