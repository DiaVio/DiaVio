The reason for this is that Vehicle one hit the rear of Vehicle two while it was decelerating due to traffic. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as "other motor vehicle traveling in lane: traveling in the same lane while decelerating," indicating that Vehicle one failed to recognize that Vehicle two was slowing down. This suggests a driver-related error on the part of the driver of Vehicle one. Additionally, Vehicle one had low tread depth, which may have contributed to reduced traction on the wet roads. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other motor vehicle traveling in lane: traveling in the same direction with higher speed," indicating that Vehicle two was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to recognize the deceleration of Vehicle two.
