The reason for this is that the driver of V1 disregarded a red light and entered the intersection, while the driver of V2 (the 1993 Pontiac Firebird) was making a left turn with a protected green left-turn arrow. V1 failed to yield the right-of-way and collided with V2. The driver of V1 was inattentive to the traffic controls due to being lost and listening to the radio, which led to inadequate surveillance and failure to realize they had a red light. On the other hand, the driver of V2 made a false assumption that V1 would yield the right-of-way, but this assumption was based on the expectation that V1 would obey the traffic signal. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to obey the traffic signal and yield the right-of-way.
