The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and steered right without yielding the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1's brakes failed, which contributed to the inability to stop at the intersection. V1 also made the choice of inappropriate/unsuccessful avoidance actions by trying to steer to the right at the intersection to avoid V2. These factors indicate that V1's actions and choices were the main cause of the accident.
