The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was experiencing poor directional control, which was a driver-related factor. The driver stated that the vehicle began steering itself to the left, and she overcompensated by steering to the right before losing control. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the alignment of the vehicle seemed different since new tires were installed a month prior. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience may have contributed to the accident. She has only been driving for 18 months and holds a provisional license, which restricts her driving hours to between 6am and 9pm when she is alone in the car. Therefore, based on the driver's poor directional control, potential alignment issues with the vehicle, and her relative inexperience, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
