The driver of Vehicle #2, a fifteen-year-old inexperienced driver, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before turning left onto the arterial road. This inadequate surveillance was identified as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the wet roads and loose debris were coded as contributing factors to Vehicle #2's responsibility.
