The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a blowout in the front right tire, which caused the vehicle to lose control and veer off the roadway. Despite the driver's attempt to pull over and bring the vehicle to a stop, the vehicle jumped the curb and struck a utility pole. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle after the tire blowout is the primary factor contributing to the crash.
