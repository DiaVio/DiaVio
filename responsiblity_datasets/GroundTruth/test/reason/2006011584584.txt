The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver stated that she was traveling no more than 32kmph (20 mph), but even at that speed, it was still too fast for the icy road surface. The driver's decision to continue accelerating and not adjust her speed to the conditions led to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent rollover. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 is not available, which suggests that the driver may have been exceeding the speed limit for the road, further contributing to the loss of control. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to travel too fast for the icy road conditions.
