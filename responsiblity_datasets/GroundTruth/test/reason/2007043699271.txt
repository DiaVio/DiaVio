The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver-related factor of an unknown performance error. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, resulting in the vehicle skidding off the right side of the road and ultimately ending up in a drainage ditch. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle, coupled with the lack of an operator's license, indicates a driver error as the primary cause of the accident.
