The reason for this is that V2 struck the rear of V1 (the 2005 Nissan Altima), indicating that V2 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with lower steady speed," suggesting that V2 was traveling at a lower speed than V1 and failed to adjust accordingly. It is important to note that V1 was driving normally and the driver did not contribute to the crash. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe distance and adjust their speed appropriately makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
