The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that V2 (the Ford Explorer) suddenly slammed on its brakes, causing her to rear-end V2. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Additionally, there is no mention of any citations or violations against the driver of V2, suggesting that their actions were not a contributing factor to the accident.
