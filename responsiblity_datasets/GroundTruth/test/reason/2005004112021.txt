The driver of Vehicle 2 admitted to not seeing the traffic control signal and disregarding it, which led to the collision with Vehicle 1. The driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and recognize the green light for Vehicle 1's left turn resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver's reported use of medication for high blood pressure may have contributed to his inadequate surveillance. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's disregard of the traffic signal and inadequate surveillance.
