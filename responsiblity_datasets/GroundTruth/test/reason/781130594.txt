The reason for this is that V2 crossed over the double yellow center lines while negotiating a right curve, indicating a failure to maintain their lane. This maneuver caused V2 to steer to the right and then back to the left, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw and sliding back across the roadway into the path of V1. This indicates that V2's actions led to the collision with V1, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
