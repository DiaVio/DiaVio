The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed and turned right onto the exit road, encountering gravel on the roadway. The driver then attempted to regain control by entering the left lane and applying the brakes, but ultimately lost control of the vehicle. The excessive speed, poor directional control, and being an inexperienced driver were all contributing factors to the accident. Additionally, the exterior distraction of the vehicle tailgating him and aggressive driving may have further impaired the driver's ability to safely navigate the curve/turn. While it is mentioned that there was a lack of signage for the curve/turn and an advisory speed reduction for the ramp, these factors alone do not absolve V1 of responsibility. The driver's actions, including the decision to turn right at a high rate of speed and the subsequent loss of control, were the primary causes of the accident.
