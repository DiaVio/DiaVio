The reason for V1's responsibility is that a mechanical problem with the left rear axle caused the vehicle to fishtail and lose control. The driver attempted to regain control by steering to the right, but ultimately V1 left the roadway and struck an embankment. The critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was the vehicle-related factor of the suspension failure, specifically the universal joint on the left rear tire. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the mechanical failure and subsequent loss of control.
