The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection with insufficient clearance. The driver of V1 admitted that she was waved on by V3, but failed to properly assess the situation before making the left turn. This resulted in V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2, which was traveling straight through the intersection. Although V2 attempted to avoid the crash by steering to the right and activating the brake lights, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not ensuring that it was safe to make the left turn.
