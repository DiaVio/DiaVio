The driver of Vehicle one made a U-turn as the traffic light turned yellow, which is a risky maneuver. Additionally, the driver falsely assumed that Vehicle two (1995 Toyota 4-Runner) would stop when the light turned yellow. This false assumption of other's actions contributed to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption and risky U-turn.
