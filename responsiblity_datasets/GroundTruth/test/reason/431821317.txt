The driver of Vehicle 2 allowed the right side wheels to depart the road edge onto the gravel shoulder and then attempted to re-enter the roadway, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 1. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and a violation of traffic rules. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's actions.
