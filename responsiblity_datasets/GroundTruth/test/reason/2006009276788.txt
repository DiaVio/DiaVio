The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. This driver-related error, combined with factors such as fatigue, work-related stress, and a diabetic condition, led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and veering off the road. The driver's own admission of falling asleep, along with the confirmation from the fire/rescue team, supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
