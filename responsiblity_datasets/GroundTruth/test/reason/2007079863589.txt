The reason for this is that V1 was making a U-turn, which is a risky maneuver that requires extra caution and careful surveillance of the surrounding traffic. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the area and did not see V2 (the 2001 Toyota Corolla) approaching in the adjacent lane. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. In summary, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 approaching while making a U-turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
