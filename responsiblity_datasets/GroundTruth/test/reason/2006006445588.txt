The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn at the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted that he was driving in a rushed and somewhat aggressive manner, and he misjudged the speed of V2 (the Buick LeSabre) approaching from the opposite side of the intersection. V1 did not have a turn signal on, which led V2 to believe that V1 would not be making a left turn. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the police reported travel speed of 64 kmph (40 mph), which was higher than the posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). This further contributed to the driver's inability to accurately assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident, as the encroachment was caused by V1's failure to yield. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield to oncoming traffic, misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, and traveling too fast for conditions.
