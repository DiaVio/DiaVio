The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one made a false assumption about the actions of vehicle two (the 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche). The driver of vehicle one stated that he thought vehicle two was going to continue through the light, indicating that he did not accurately assess the situation and made an incorrect assumption about the intentions of the other driver. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: other vehicle stopped," indicating that vehicle two was already stopped in the first lane. This suggests that vehicle one failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. On the other hand, there is no known pre-crash information for the driver of vehicle two, and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for vehicle two was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the available information, vehicle two does not appear to be primarily responsible for the crash.
