The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons, resulting in V1 traveling off the road and impacting a tree and a fence. The driver's loss of control and subsequent collision with the tree and fence indicate that V1 was the main contributing factor to the crash.
