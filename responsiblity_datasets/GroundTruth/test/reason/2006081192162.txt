The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver stated a large semi cut him off, causing him to brake and swerve left. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and overcompensated in response to the situation. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, further supporting the driver's lack of control. Additionally, the driver's lack of knowledge regarding his speed prior to the crash suggests a lack of attentiveness and awareness while driving. The fact that he has only been driving for two years and has no prior driver training further indicates a lack of experience and potentially inadequate driving skills. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and overcompensating when faced with a sudden lane change by the semi-truck.
