The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by drinking a soda while driving and stated that he did not see V2 until the last minute due to sun glare. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying adequate attention to the road and failed to properly survey the surroundings. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph, which exceeds the speed limit of 72 kmph. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Caterpillar backhoe) was traveling at a steady speed and there is no indication of any fault or negligence on their part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distracted driving, failure to properly survey the road, and exceeding the speed limit.
