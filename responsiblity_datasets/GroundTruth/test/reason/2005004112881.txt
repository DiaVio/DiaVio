The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the 1991 Volkswagen Jetta, was making a left turn at the T-intersection and failed to see V2, the 1994 Ford Taurus, traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane. V1's driver admitted to not seeing V2 and did not take any avoidance actions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking to the passenger just prior to the crash. These factors indicate that V1's driver had a driver recognition error and inadequate surveillance, which ultimately led to the collision.
