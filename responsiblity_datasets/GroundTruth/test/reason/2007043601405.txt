The driver of V2 swerved sharply to the right and then jerked the wheel to the left, causing the car to lose control and spin 180 degrees. This incorrect evasive action, combined with over-steering and braking, led to the control loss of V2. As a result, V2 re-entered lane two and was struck head-on by V1 (the 2007 International tractor). While V1 reported that another tractor-trailer was merging into his lane, it was V2's actions that ultimately caused the accident. V1 was following V2 in lane two and did not contribute to the control loss or the subsequent collision.
