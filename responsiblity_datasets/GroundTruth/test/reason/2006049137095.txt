The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) who was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1's false assumption that V2 would stop because the light turned yellow led to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
