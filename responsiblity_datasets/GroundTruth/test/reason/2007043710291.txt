The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. V1 stopped for a few seconds to let at least one car pass, but then turned left in front of V2, causing the collision. V1's failure to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn is considered an inadequate surveillance and driver error.
