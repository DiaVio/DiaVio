The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 17-year old male, failed to control his vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. He admitted that his foot slipped off the brake, causing him to strike the truck in front of him. Factors such as inexperience, unfamiliarity with the roadway and vehicle, insufficient braking, and inattention due to being concerned about passing his road test were associated with the driver's error. V2 (the 2006 International tractor-trailer) was stopped in the right lane, waiting for the light to change. The driver stated that he felt like his truck jumped out of gear, but he was not responsible for the accident as no critical reason or associated factors were coded to him.
