The reason for this is that V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to change lanes into the off-ramp lane to exit the highway. This indicates poor directional control on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver admitted to being inexperienced and not a very good driver, and also expressed discomfort with driving on major highways. These factors contribute to the driver's responsibility for the accident.
