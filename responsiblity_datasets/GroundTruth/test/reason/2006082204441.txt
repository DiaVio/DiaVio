The driver of V1 admitted that he did not realize the traffic light had turned red until he was already in the intersection. This indicates a failure to recognize and respond to the changing traffic signal, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by focusing on the vehicle in front of him, which further contributed to his failure to notice the red light. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to obey the traffic signal and their external distraction.
