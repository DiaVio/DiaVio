The reason for this is that Vehicle #1's right front wheel departed the pavement and struck the bridge abutment, causing the vehicle to roll onto its left side. The driver's untruthful statements during the interview and the lack of evidence supporting the presence of a bicyclist crossing in front of the vehicle suggest that the driver failed to recognize that he was off the road until it was too late. Additionally, the driver's use of medication for high blood pressure and wearing sunglasses at the time of the crash may have contributed to his recognition error.
