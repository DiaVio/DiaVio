The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 22-year-old female driver, failed to negotiate the right turning curve and instead continued straight, resulting in the vehicle traveling off the roadway and colliding with a concrete curb multiple times. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to properly control the vehicle and navigate the curve, leading to the accident.
