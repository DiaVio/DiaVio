The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V1 (the 2006 Ford Taurus) prior to the crash. This lack of awareness and failure to yield to oncoming traffic from the northbound approach resulted in V1 striking the right side of V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," indicating that V2 encroached into the path of V1. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic are the main reasons for their primary responsibility in this three-vehicle crash.
