The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection against the red light, indicating a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by dialing his cell phone and made a false assumption that the light had changed to green. These factors contributed to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and resulted in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's actions of running a red light and being distracted by cell phone use make them primarily responsible for the accident.
