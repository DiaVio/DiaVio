The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not paying attention to the traffic signal. She stated that she looked up and saw the signal was green, but when she looked up again, it had turned red. This indicates that she was not focused on the road and failed to notice the changing signal in time to stop. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) according to the police report, which is above the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). This suggests that V1 was not driving at a safe and appropriate speed for the road conditions. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to stop in time, combined with the excessive speed, make her primarily responsible for the accident.
