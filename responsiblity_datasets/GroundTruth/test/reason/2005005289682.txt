The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive rate of speed for the conditions, as indicated by the coding of "too fast for conditions" as the critical reason for the crash. This, combined with the driver's inexperience, led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and skidding through the intersection.
