The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the distance and speed of V2 when attempting to turn left in front of it. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 made no avoidance maneuver, further contributing to the accident. On the other hand, V2 attempted to avoid V1 by applying the brakes, indicating that V2 took appropriate action to prevent the collision. The driver of V2 also claimed that V1 did not have its headlights on at the time of the crash, suggesting a possible violation of traffic regulations by V1. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of misjudgment and failure to yield, as well as the lack of avoidance action, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
