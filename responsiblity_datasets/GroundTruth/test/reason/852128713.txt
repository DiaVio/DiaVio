The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway to the right, tracking across the gravel shoulder and down an embankment before continuing in a grassy field. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the rollover crash.
