The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions (rain on the roadway), which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver mentioned feeling fatigued while driving, which could have impaired her ability to react appropriately to the wet road conditions. The low tread depth on both rear tires of V1 may have also contributed to the loss of control and hydroplaning.
