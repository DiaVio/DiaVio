The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about V2's actions. V1 assumed that V2 would yield to him when there was a break in traffic, but V2 proceeded to cross the intersection. As a result, the front of V1 collided with the left side of V2. V1's false assumption and failure to properly assess the situation led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
