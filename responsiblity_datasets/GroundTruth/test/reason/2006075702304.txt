The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, as stated in the critical reason for the critical event for V1. V1 was unable to avoid hitting V2 (the Chevrolet Malibu) when V2 abruptly stopped due to the non-contact vehicle pulling into the southbound lane. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a driver-related factor and a violation of safe driving practices. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 resulted in the collision and subsequent loss of control and rollover of V2.
