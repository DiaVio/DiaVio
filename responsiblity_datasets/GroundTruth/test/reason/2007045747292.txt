The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by reaching down to retrieve his dropped cell phone, which caused the vehicle to veer off the road onto the grass median. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation while trying to steer the vehicle back onto the road led to the loss of control, rotation, and subsequent rollover. These actions indicate driver error and poor directional control, which ultimately caused the accident.
