The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 attempted a left-hand turn into a driveway while negotiating a curve to the right. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically Vehicle #2 (Dodge Intrepid), which was traveling in the opposite direction. Additionally, it is mentioned that the Critical Reason for the Critical Event involving Vehicle #1 was coded as an unknown type of driver error. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #1 may have been inattentive, misjudged the gap distance of Vehicle #2, or made a false assumption. Furthermore, it is noted that the driver of Vehicle #1 had consumed an alcoholic beverage 1-Â½ hours prior to the crash, which could have impaired their judgment and reaction time. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way while attempting a left-hand turn.
