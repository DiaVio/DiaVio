The critical reason for the accident is stated as "Illegal maneuver" which refers to the driver of V1 disregarding the traffic signal. This indicates that V1 likely ran a red light or failed to yield the right of way at the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1995 Honda Civic coupe).
