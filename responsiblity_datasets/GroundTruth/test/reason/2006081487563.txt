Reason: V1 was the moving vehicle that collided with the parked V2. The driver of V1 was reported to have engaged in aggressive driving behavior, possibly intentionally driving into the parked car due to anger and her mental state. This indicates a lack of proper control and judgment on the part of V1, making her primarily responsible for the collision.
