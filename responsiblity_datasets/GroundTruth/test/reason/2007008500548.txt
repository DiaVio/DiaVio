The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to following too closely to the vehicle in front of him. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance and was unable to respond in time when the vehicle in front suddenly braked. Additionally, V1's action of steering right into lane two without ensuring it was clear resulted in V2 colliding with the right side of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and improper lane change are the main factors contributing to the accident.
