The driver of V1 claimed that V2 (the driver of the 2001 Ford Focus sedan) suddenly slammed on the brakes, causing V1 to collide with the rear of V2. However, the critical pre-crash event coded to V1 was "following too closely to respond to other driver's actions." This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from V2, which would have allowed enough time and space to react and avoid the collision. Additionally, V1 veered off the side of the road and hit a tree after the initial impact, suggesting that V1 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle. This further supports the notion that V1 was not driving with due care and attention. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to following too closely and failing to maintain control of their vehicle.
