The reason for this is that V1 initiated the lane change to the right, and the right side of V1 made contact with the left side of V2 (the Chevy C1500). This indicates that V1 failed to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's driver fled the scene on foot, suggesting a lack of responsibility and accountability. However, it is important to note that the exact reason for V1's lane change and the driver's behavior could not be determined without an interview. The personal problems mentioned, such as the driver's distress and potential drug addiction, may have contributed to driver inattention and errors. Nonetheless, without further information, V1 remains primarily responsible for the crash.
