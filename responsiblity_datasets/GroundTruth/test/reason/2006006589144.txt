The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 veered too far to the right into the shoulder area and then attempted to change lanes without adequately surveilling the surrounding traffic. - V1 admitted to not seeing Vehicle two (V2) approaching from the left before the collision. - V1's inadequate surveillance and inexperience as a driver (only two years of driving experience) contributed to the crash. - The police report also mentions that V1 had previous damage from another crash, indicating a possible history of driving incidents. It is important to note that the driver of V2 could not be reached for an interview or comments, so their perspective and potential contribution to the accident are unknown. However, based on the information provided, V1's actions and lack of attention appear to be the primary cause of the collision.
