The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road. The driver was talking on a cell phone and looking down at something inside the vehicle, which led to a recognition error and a failure to notice the stopped vehicles ahead. This distraction and failure to recognize the situation resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2, which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3. Therefore, V1's distracted driving and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
