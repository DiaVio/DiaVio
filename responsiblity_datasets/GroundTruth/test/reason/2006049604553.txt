The reason for this is that V1 made a driver decision error by attempting to make a left turn at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. The driver's view was obstructed by a large pickup truck stopped in lane 3 of the oncoming lanes of traffic. Despite not being able to see clearly, V1 proceeded with the left turn without ensuring sufficient clearance, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) was traveling in the correct lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
