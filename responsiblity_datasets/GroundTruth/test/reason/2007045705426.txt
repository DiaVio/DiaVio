The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver pressed the accelerator instead of the brake, causing the vehicle to cross the east/west road, strike a mailbox, and travel through a yard. This indicates a driver-related performance error. Additionally, the driver's recent heart surgery, ongoing recovery, and fatigue may have contributed to her inability to properly operate the vehicle. The wet road conditions and overcast weather were also factors that may have affected the driver's ability to control the vehicle.
