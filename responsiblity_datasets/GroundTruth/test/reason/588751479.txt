The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the eastbound travel lane without utilizing the available seat belt. This means that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not properly restrained, which could have contributed to the severity of their injuries. Additionally, Vehicle 1 struck the right side of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was already in the intersection and waiting for east/west traffic to clear.
