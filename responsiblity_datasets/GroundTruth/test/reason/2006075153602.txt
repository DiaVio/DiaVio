The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to turn left across the southbound lanes, and according to the Critical Pre-crash Event, the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the area and failed to look to the side before making the turn. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not exercise proper caution and did not ensure that it was safe to make the left turn. Additionally, there was a sightline restriction from two non-contact in-transport vehicles, which may have further hindered the driver's ability to see oncoming traffic. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1990 Ford F150) stated that V1 appeared in front of him and he hit his brakes but it was too late. While the driver of V2 may have been unable to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for failing to properly assess the situation and make a safe left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to look to the side before making the left turn.
