The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway and struck a utility pole, causing it to breakaway and fall onto the vehicle. V1 then re-entered the roadway and struck a legally parked and unoccupied vehicle. The driver of V1 attempted to flee the scene but was unable to do so due to the damage to the vehicle. The driver then fled on foot. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 was not in control of the vehicle, leading to the departure from the roadway and subsequent collisions. The driver's attempt to flee the scene further indicates a lack of responsibility and accountability.
