The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver swerved left to avoid a deer, which caused the vehicle to enter the median and cross into the eastbound roadway. V1 then rolled onto its side and collided with V2 (the 2000 BMW 540i) in the eastbound lane. While V2 was traveling at a relatively high speed, the driver of V2 took appropriate action by slamming on the brakes and continuing straight in lane two. V2 did not contribute to the initial cause of the accident. Therefore, V1's incorrect evasive action and subsequent loss of control led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
