The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the left lane before attempting to change lanes. She did not turn her head to check for traffic in the left lane and also failed to use her left side mirror to check for the presence of other vehicles. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which was the critical pre-crash event. The driver's failure to properly check for traffic and change lanes safely resulted in V1 departing the roadway and ultimately crashing into the ditch.
