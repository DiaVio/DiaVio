The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes into lane two without adequately checking for traffic in that lane. The driver of V1 admitted to only checking the rearview mirror and not turning her head to check for traffic in lane two. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 encroaching into the adjacent lane and colliding with V2 (the 1998 Dodge Durango). While V2 attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to properly check for traffic before changing lanes.
