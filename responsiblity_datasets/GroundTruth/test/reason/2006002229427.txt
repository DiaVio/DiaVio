The driver of V1 admitted to being emotionally upset, arguing with his passenger, and not paying attention to his driving. He stated that he turned his head to look at his girlfriend, did not give her time to buckle her seat belt, and was speeding out of a driveway. These actions indicate a clear lack of focus and disregard for safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver stated that he braked as he began departing the roadway but could not stop the vehicle, suggesting that he was traveling too fast for the conditions. The police also did not find alcohol or illegal drugs to be factors in the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's admission and the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
