The Critical Pre-crash event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "This vehicle traveling, turning left at the intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical event was coded as an illegal maneuver. Although it is unclear whether the driver intentionally disregarded the traffic control device or did not recognize its presence, the fact remains that Vehicle #2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which resulted in the collision with Vehicle #1 (the Honda Civic). Vehicle #1 (the Honda Civic) was traveling straight on the northbound roadway and had the right of way. The witness stated that Vehicle #1 had the green light, indicating that it was following the traffic signal correctly. Therefore, Vehicle #1 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to an illegal left turn at the intersection.
