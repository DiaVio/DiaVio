The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to feeling fatigued and only having slept for 3 hours the previous night, well below the recommended 8 hours. The driver also mentioned being tired and possibly closing his eyes for a second. This indicates that the driver was not in a proper state of alertness and may have fallen asleep at the wheel, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, there is no evidence of another vehicle making contact with V2 before the collision with V1, contradicting the claim made by the driver of V1 about a phantom vehicle. The driver of V2 could not be reached for an interview, so there is no information available to suggest any fault on their part. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's fatigue and potential falling asleep at the wheel.
