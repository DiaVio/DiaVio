The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at the construction on either side of the roadway, which was coded as an external distraction. This distraction caused the driver of V1 to not notice V2 (the disabled GMC Yukon) in front of him until it was too late. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing any emergency flashers on V2, indicating a lack of attention to the road ahead. Furthermore, the associated factors coded to the driver of V1, such as conversation with his passenger and a traffic flow interruption caused by V2 blocking lane one, also contribute to V1's primary responsibility. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was not fully focused on the road and failed to react appropriately to the situation. The absence of skid marks prior to impact indicates that the driver of V1 did not apply the brakes in time to avoid the collision. The high speed at which V1 struck V2, causing it to be knocked off the jack and move forward, further supports V1's primary responsibility. In contrast, V2's primary responsibility is not clearly identified in the case summary. While V2 was disabled and missing a rear tire, it was properly locked and had its emergency flashers activated. These actions indicate that V2 took appropriate measures to indicate its disabled state to other drivers. However, the case summary does not provide any evidence to suggest that V2 was at fault for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to notice and react to the disabled vehicle in front of them.
