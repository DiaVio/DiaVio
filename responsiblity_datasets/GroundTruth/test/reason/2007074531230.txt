The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1, which ultimately led to the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from crossing street, across path, further suggesting that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. While V2 (the driver of the 1996 Toyota Camry) misjudged the gap or speed of V1 and made an inappropriate avoidance maneuver, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to V2's right of way is the primary factor that contributed to the accident.
