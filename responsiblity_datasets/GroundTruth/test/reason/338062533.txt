The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 reportedly fell asleep and allowed the vehicle to depart from the left shoulder and enter the center median. This action caused Vehicle 1 to collide with a roadside marker and an embankment, resulting in a rollover event. The driver's drowsiness and failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the sequence of events that caused the accident.
