The driver of V1 entered the center turn lane and proceeded to cross the westbound traffic lane without having a clear field of vision due to the glare from the early morning sun. Despite attempting to block the glare with the sunshade, the driver was unable to clearly see the roadway and traffic. This lack of visibility resulted in V1 cutting across in front of V2 (the International pickup), causing the collision. While V2 could have potentially anticipated V1's actions and yielded, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to ensure a safe maneuver in the presence of the glare and obstructed visibility.
