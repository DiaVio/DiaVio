The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not anticipate the vehicle in front of him (V2) stopping. This is evident from the fact that V1 struck the back of V2, initiating the chain reaction of rear-end impacts. Additionally, factors such as following too closely and falsely assuming that the other driver would continue to proceed during rush hour congestion contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the 5-vehicle crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
