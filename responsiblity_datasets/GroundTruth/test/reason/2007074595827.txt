The reason for this is that V2 was the one who changed lanes to the left and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 did not properly observe the intersection and failed to see V1 approaching from the westbound lane. Additionally, the visual restriction caused by the trees and fence in the northeast corner of the intersection was an associated factor in this crash. Therefore, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and observe V1 approaching from the westbound lane makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
