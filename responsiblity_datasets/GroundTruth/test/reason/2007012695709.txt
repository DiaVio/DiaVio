The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in a failure to yield the right of way. Additionally, V1 proceeded with insufficient clearance and failed to stop for the traffic control device, as the light had turned red for V1. These actions indicate a driver-related error and negligence on the part of V1.
