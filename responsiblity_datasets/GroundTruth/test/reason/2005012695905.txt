The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by the non-contact vehicle that was firing at him, leading to an external distraction and a recognition error. The driver of V1 was engaged in non-driving activities (returning fire) and failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's speed is unknown, but it is mentioned that traveling too fast was one of the associated factors coded to this driver. These factors contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
