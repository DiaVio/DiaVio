The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling in the wrong direction in the westbound lane, directly opposing the flow of traffic. This is evident from the fact that V2, the 1994 Subaru Legacy wagon, was traveling eastbound in the same lane as V1. V1's attempt to brake prior to the impact indicates that the driver realized the mistake but was unable to avoid the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1's left back quarter panel impacted the concrete barrier adjacent to the lane further supports the conclusion that V1 was in the wrong lane. The rotation and final rest positions of both vehicles also indicate that V1 was the one traveling in the wrong direction. Therefore, V1's actions of traveling in the wrong lane and causing a head-on collision make it primarily responsible for the accident.
