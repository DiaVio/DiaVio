The driver of V1 admitted to seeing the red light and attempting to stop, but sliding through the intersection. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as traveling too fast for conditions, indicating that the driver was not able to adjust their speed appropriately for the wet road conditions. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V1 was coded as weather-related, specifically rain. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle 2 (V2) stated that they were stopped at the intersection, waiting for the light to change to green when their vehicle was struck by V1. There is no indication that V2 was at fault or contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and failing to stop at the red light.
