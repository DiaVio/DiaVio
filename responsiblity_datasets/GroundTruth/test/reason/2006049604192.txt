The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to take adequate evasive action to avoid the collision with the shopping cart. Despite recognizing the object in the roadway, the driver's reaction time was not sufficient to prevent the collision. Additionally, the driver was eating breakfast while driving, which may have contributed to a distraction and reduced attention on the road. Furthermore, based on the vehicle dynamics, it is indicated that V1 was traveling at a speed higher than the posted speed limit, which could have made it more difficult for the driver to react in time. Overall, V1's failure to take appropriate evasive action, combined with potential distractions and speeding, led to the crash.
