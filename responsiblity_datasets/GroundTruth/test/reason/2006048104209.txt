The reason for V1's responsibility is that she made a false assumption about the flow of traffic in the westbound lanes. She misjudged the situation and believed that the westbound traffic had a red light, leading her to proceed with her left turn. However, this assumption was incorrect, as V2 (the driver of the 2000 Nissan Maxima) was traveling in the westbound lane and struck the right side of V1's vehicle. V1's false assumption of the traffic conditions and failure to accurately judge the flow of traffic led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
