The reason for this is that V2 was traveling east in lane one on the intersecting street and impacted the left side of V1, causing the deployment of the driver's side airbag in V1. V2's impact pushed V1 eastbound and caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, resulting in V1's left front impacting the left side of V2. Therefore, V2's actions directly led to the collision and subsequent injuries sustained by the 75-year-old female driver of V1.
