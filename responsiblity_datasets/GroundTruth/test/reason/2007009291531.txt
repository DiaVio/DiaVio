The driver of V1 stated that he was driving in lane three and intended to change lanes to the right but was unable to do so due to vehicles in lane two blocking his path. When he returned his attention forward, he failed to brake successfully and crashed into the rear of V2, causing a chain reaction with V3 and V4. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was "Other motor vehicle in lane stopped," and the critical reason was "Incorrect evasive action." The driver of V1 was looking at approaching traffic on the right instead of focusing on the vehicles ahead of him in his lane. Additionally, the low tire tread on all tires of V1 may have contributed to the driver's inability to brake successfully. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to take appropriate evasive action and maintain proper attention to the road ahead.
