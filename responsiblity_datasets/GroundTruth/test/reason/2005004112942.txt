The driver of V1 stated that he was making a left turn at the intersection but hit the concrete divider, causing the vehicle to roll onto its right side. The driver did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling between 11 and 20 MPH at the time of impact. The critical precrash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating poor directional control. This was coded as a performance error, failing to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver mentioned that he had only driven this vehicle twice as it was a rental car. This lack of familiarity with the vehicle may have contributed to the poor directional control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance error and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
