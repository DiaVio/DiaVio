The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was traveling too fast for the conditions and was unable to respond to the unexpected actions of Vehicle #1. Despite the presence of a curve warning sign and a suggested speed limit, Vehicle #2 failed to adjust their speed accordingly. The driver of Vehicle #2 admitted to braking and skidding before colliding with Vehicle #1, indicating that they were unable to stop in time. If Vehicle #2 had been traveling at the suggested speed and anticipated the actions of other road users, there would have been enough time to slow down or stop to avoid the collision.
