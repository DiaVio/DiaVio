The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the approaching emergency vehicle coming from the right, despite having a limited view to the right. This misjudgment of the gap or other's speed led to the driver of V1 colliding with the rear of V2 (the 1997 Toyota Tacoma Pick up) when V2 stopped to let the fire truck pass through the intersection.
