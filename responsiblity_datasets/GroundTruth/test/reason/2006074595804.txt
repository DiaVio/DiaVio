The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by her two-year-old son crying and reaching back to comfort him. As a result, she failed to notice that the traffic signal had turned red and was unable to stop in time, leading to the collision with V2 (the 2003 Toyota Corolla) and subsequent collisions with V3 (the 1997 Toyota 4Runner) and V4 (the 1993 Ford Taurus).
