The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 rear-ended Vehicle 1, initiating the collision. This initial impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate and subsequently roll over, resulting in damage to both vehicles and serious injuries to the driver of Vehicle 1. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 2 for causing the chain of events leading to the accident.
