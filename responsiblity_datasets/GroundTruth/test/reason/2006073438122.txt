The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel and having no recollection of the crash. This indicates that the driver was not alert and in control of the vehicle, leading to the vehicle entering the intersection and colliding with vehicle two (V2). The driver's fatigue and lack of sleep contributed to the critical pre-crash event of V1 crossing over the intersection while asleep.
