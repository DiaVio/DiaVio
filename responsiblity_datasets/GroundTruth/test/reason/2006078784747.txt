The driver of V1 swerved to avoid hitting a bird, which caused the vehicle to depart the roadway and ultimately roll over. This indicates that the driver's actions were the primary cause of the crash. Additionally, the driver's fatigue, with only four hours of sleep in the 24 hours preceding the crash, could have impaired her judgment and reaction time, contributing to the overcompensation and loss of control. While the presence of the bird in the roadway was the critical pre-crash event, it was the driver's response to the bird that led to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
