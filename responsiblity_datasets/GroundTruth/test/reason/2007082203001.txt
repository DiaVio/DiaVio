The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before turning. The driver of V1 admitted that he did not see V2 (the Subaru Legacy) until after he had already started to make his turn. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
