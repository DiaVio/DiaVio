The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 MPH) and failed to recognize that the traffic ahead was stopped. The driver of V1 locked up their brakes and skidded, ultimately colliding with the rear of V2 (the 2001 Buick Century) which was already stopped in the traffic lane. Therefore, V1's failure to recognize the stopped traffic and their subsequent collision with V2 makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
