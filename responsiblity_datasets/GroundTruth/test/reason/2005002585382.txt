The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 stated to the police that she did not realize that Vehicle #2 was stopped and attempted to brake but not in time to avoid the collision. This indicates a misjudgment of the gap or the other vehicle's speed, which is a decision error. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was taking prescription medications that could have potential side effects of dizziness, tiredness, or headaches, which may have impaired her ability to react in a timely manner. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 (1987 Ford F-350 stake body) was stopped with his directional on for approximately 1 minute, waiting for traffic to clear before making a left-hand turn. He caught the movement of Vehicle #1 just prior to impact in his side mirror but was unable to take any avoidance maneuvers. There were no associated factors coded to this driver. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment and potential impairment from prescription medications.
