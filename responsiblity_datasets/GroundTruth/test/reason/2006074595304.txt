The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that the glare from the setting sun obscured his view, but it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed before entering the intersection. Additionally, the driver admitted to feeling fatigued and being "a little impatient" at the time of the crash, which may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and impatience are the main factors that led to the collision, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
