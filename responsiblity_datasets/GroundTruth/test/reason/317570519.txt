The reason for this is that V2 drifted out of its travel lane onto the right roadside, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. This action caused V2 to cross the center lane and collide with V3 (the 2013 Kia Optima sedan). After the initial impact, V2 continued in the wrong lane and collided with V1 (the 2008 Honda Accord sedan), resulting in serious injuries to the driver of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to stay in its lane and regain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the chain of events that caused the accident.
