The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V1's actions. The driver of V2 saw V1 initially pull forward and assumed that it would continue to merge. Instead of looking forward again to confirm V1's movements, the driver of V2 continued to look to the left for an opportunity to merge. This false assumption led to the driver of V2 not noticing that V1 had stopped briefly before pulling forward again, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to properly assess the situation and make accurate judgments about V1's actions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
