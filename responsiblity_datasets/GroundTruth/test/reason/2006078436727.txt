The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by an external noise, which caused him to take his attention away from the road. As a result, he failed to notice that V2 (the GMC Express passenger van) was slowing down to make a right turn at the intersection. The driver of V1 then applied the brakes and skidded for about 15 meters before colliding with the rear left corner of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
