The driver of Vehicle #1 had a seizure and departed the right side of the road, ultimately crashing into a pond. The driver admitted to not taking his medication for controlling his epileptic seizures and consuming large quantities of alcohol the night before the incident. The combination of alcohol and drugs, along with the lack of medication, caused the seizure. Additionally, the driver tested positive for cocaine in the medical report. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired physical condition and failure to take necessary medication.
