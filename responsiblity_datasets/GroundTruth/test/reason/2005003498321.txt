The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was attempting to make a U-turn from the right lane, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver of Vehicle #1 was also found to have inadequate surveillance, as they looked but did not see the oncoming Vehicle #2 (2001 Nissan X-Terra). Vehicle #2 was traveling straight in the left lane and was unable to avoid the collision with Vehicle #1, as Vehicle #1 turned in front of it. The driver of Vehicle #2 was not found to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, Vehicle #1's illegal maneuver and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the crash.
