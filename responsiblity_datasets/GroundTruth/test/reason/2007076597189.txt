The driver of V1 admitted to not recognizing the motorcycle coming in the opposite direction and being more focused on the motel rather than the traffic on the road. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road before making the left turn into the motel driveway. The critical reason coded to V1 is inadequate surveillance, specifically failing to look or looking but not seeing the oncoming motorcycle. Additionally, the driver of V1 was new to the area and focused on finding a motel, which may have contributed to their lack of attention to the traffic on the road. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 (the police motorcycle) was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V1 encroached into V2's lane from the center two-way turn lane. However, the critical reason was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and being more focused on finding a motel rather than paying attention to the traffic on the road.
