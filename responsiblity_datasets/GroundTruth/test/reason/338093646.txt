The reason for this is that the driver allowed Vehicle 1 to depart from the right road edge, made steering maneuvers that redirected the vehicle towards the left road edge, and ultimately caused it to enter a wooded area and collide with a split tree bole. The lack of restraint use by the driver, as evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seat belt system, further supports the conclusion that the driver's actions and failure to wear a seat belt contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained in the accident.
