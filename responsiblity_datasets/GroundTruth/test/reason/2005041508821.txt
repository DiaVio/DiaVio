The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 changed lanes without properly checking her blind spot and failed to stop for a red light at the intersection. This is evident from the driver's statement that she turned her head over her right shoulder to check her blind spot, taking her focus away from the driving task. Additionally, the driver admitted to noticing that she was already in the intersection under a red light when she refocused her attention in front of her. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for a traffic control device and the driver's recognition error and external distractions contribute to her primary responsibility for the accident.
