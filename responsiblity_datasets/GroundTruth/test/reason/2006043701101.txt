The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver panicked as he approached the intersection and drove off the road to the right. In an attempt to bring the vehicle back onto the roadway, the driver overcompensated by jerking the wheel to the left, which resulted in the vehicle initiating a rollover on the roadway. This overcompensation was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, factors such as the driver's inexperience (it was his first time driving a vehicle with a standard transmission and he had only been driving for one year), the wet roadway conditions, and the rain were associated factors that contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle effectively.
