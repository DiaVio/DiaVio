The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver passed out while operating the vehicle, causing it to veer into other lanes and initiate a series of collisions. The passenger in V1 attempted to steer the vehicle back into its proper travel lane, but their actions were improper and resulted in the subsequent crashes with V2 and V3. V1's erratic movement and loss of control directly led to the chain of events that caused the collisions.
