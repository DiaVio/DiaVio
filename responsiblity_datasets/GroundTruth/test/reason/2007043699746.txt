The reason for this is that the driver of V1, an unlicensed 14-year-old male, was operating the vehicle without a license and without proper experience. He stated that he had only helped move vehicles short distances before and had not driven on open roads. Additionally, the driver lost control of the vehicle and locked up the brakes, indicating poor directional control. Therefore, the driver's lack of experience, combined with his poor control of the vehicle, makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
