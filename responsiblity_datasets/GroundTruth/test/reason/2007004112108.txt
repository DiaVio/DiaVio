The driver of V1 reported that another non-contact vehicle cut in front of him, forcing him to switch lanes into lane one where V2 (the 2007 Honda Accord) was traveling. V1 failed to adequately surveil the lane before changing lanes, resulting in the collision with V2. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was "inadequate surveillance - looked but did not see." Additionally, the driver of V1 was an inexperienced driver, having only had his license for a little over a year.
