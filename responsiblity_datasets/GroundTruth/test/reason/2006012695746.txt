The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver's inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as "failed to look, looked but did not see," suggests that she did not properly assess the oncoming traffic before initiating her turn. Additionally, the driver's exterior distraction of looking for a south entrance to the gas station and her driver inexperience further contribute to her responsibility for the accident.
