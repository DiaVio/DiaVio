The driver of V2, a 17-year-old female, admitted to not seeing the Lincoln before entering the intersection to make a left turn. This indicates inadequate surveillance on her part. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle turning left at intersection" and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "inadequate surveillance." These factors further support the conclusion that V2 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. On the other hand, the driver of V1, a 21-year-old male, claimed that V2 suddenly pulled into the intersection, but the evidence suggests otherwise. The police reported travel speed for V1 was 89 kmph, which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 72 kmph. There were also over 25 meters of precrash skid marks at the scene for V1, indicating that the driver was speeding and attempted an incorrect evasive maneuver. These factors contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while making a left turn, while V1 shares some responsibility for speeding and incorrect evasive maneuver.
