The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to use due care by following too closely to respond to the actions of other vehicles. The driver stated that she was "keeping up with the traffic" and did not have time to stop when the traffic suddenly stopped. This indicates that she was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her, which resulted in her vehicle skidding into the back of V2 (the 2003 Lexus) and causing a chain reaction of collisions. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to stop in time are the primary reasons for the accident.
