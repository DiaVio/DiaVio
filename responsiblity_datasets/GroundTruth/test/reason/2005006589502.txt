The reason for this is that V1 made an illegal maneuver by turning left from the wrong traffic lane. Additionally, V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the driver of the 1999 Toyota Corolla) was also going to turn left, which led to the collision. V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway may have contributed to their incorrect assumption and illegal maneuver. Therefore, V1's actions of turning left from the wrong lane and making a false assumption about V2's intentions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
