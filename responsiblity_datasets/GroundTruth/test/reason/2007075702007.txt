The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. The driver of V1 saw V2 slowing down and applied the brakes, but when the brake lights of V2 were momentarily not visible, the driver of V1 assumed that V2 was going to continue through the intersection. This false assumption led to V1 not maintaining a safe distance and ultimately resulted in the collision with the back of V2. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 admitted to using his cell phone at the time of the crash suggests a distraction that may have contributed to the false assumption and lack of attention to the road.
