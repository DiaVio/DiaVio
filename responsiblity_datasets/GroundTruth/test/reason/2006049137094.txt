The driver of V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, disregarding the traffic signal. This illegal maneuver led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not see V2 prior to the crash and made no attempt to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and lack of attention to the road make them primarily responsible for the accident.
