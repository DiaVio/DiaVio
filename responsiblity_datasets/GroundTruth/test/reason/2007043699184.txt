The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 attempted a U-turn from the side street and turned left across the roadway into the direction she had come from. This action violated the right-of-way of Vehicle 2 (the Ford F150 pickup) traveling behind her in the same lane. Vehicle 1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making the U-turn, which is identified as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was taking a doctor-prescribed blood thinner, wore corrective lenses for astigmatism, and rarely drove on this road. These factors may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and decision-making. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle 2 stated that he was heading to work when Vehicle 1 attempted the U-turn and pulled across his lane of travel. He tried to steer left and brake to avoid the collision but was unable to do so. No critical reason was coded for the driver of Vehicle 2, indicating that his actions did not contribute significantly to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 (the Toyota Camry sedan) is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and improper U-turn maneuver.
