The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop when the traffic signal turned red for their direction. This is a clear violation of traffic laws and indicates that V1 was not paying attention to the road or the traffic signal. Additionally, V1's driver reported experiencing chest pain and reaching for pills in his pocket, which suggests that he may have been distracted and not fully focused on driving. The fact that V1's driver does not remember going through the intersection further supports the conclusion that they were not fully aware of their surroundings.
