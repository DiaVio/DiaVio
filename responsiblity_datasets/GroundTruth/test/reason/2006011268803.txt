The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when attempting to reenter the roadway after swerving onto the paved shoulder to avoid a collision with a non-contact vehicle. This overcorrection led to the counter-clockwise rotation of V1, causing it to cross the two traffic lanes and ultimately roll over into the grassy ditch. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, having only been driving for two years and driving that class of vehicle for even less, was identified as an associated factor. This lack of experience may have contributed to the driver's inability to properly control the vehicle after the initial swerve. Overall, V1's driver's overcompensation and inexperience are the primary reasons for the crash.
