The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2 (the 1999 Toyota Tacoma) which had slowed down and come to a stop due to traffic ahead. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to V1 as a driver-related factor: "too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others." This suggests that V1 was traveling at a speed that did not allow enough time to react and stop safely when V2 slowed down and stopped.
