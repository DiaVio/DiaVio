The reason for this is that V2 was traveling westbound and had a stop sign at the intersection. V1, the Hyundai Accent, was traveling southbound and did not have any traffic control device on their roadway. V1 stated that they were going straight when V2 proceeded from the stop sign, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right-of-way to V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield at the stop sign and crossing the intersection when it was not their right-of-way makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
