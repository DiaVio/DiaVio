The reason for this is that V1 departed the right side of the roadway and struck a utility pole and a metal box. The critical reason for this departure was coded as "driver related factor; sleeping, that is, actually sleep." This indicates that the driver of V1 was asleep at the time of the crash, which would explain why the vehicle veered off the road and collided with the utility pole and metal box.
