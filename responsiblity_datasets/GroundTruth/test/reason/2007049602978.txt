The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1's driver steered left to avoid a box on the road, which caused the front of V1 to strike the median jersey barrier. - This indicates that V1's driver made an overcompensation maneuver, which was a driver-related factor. - Additionally, V1's driver was distracted by conversing with her passenger just prior to the crash, which further contributed to the driver-related factor. - The mismatched tires on V1, with one wheel being a different size, may have also affected the vehicle's stability and handling during the maneuver. - Furthermore, the driver's fatigue from working longer hours and consuming energy drinks to stay awake likely impaired her judgment and reaction time. Overall, the combination of driver-related factors, distraction, fatigue, and the mismatched tires led to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
