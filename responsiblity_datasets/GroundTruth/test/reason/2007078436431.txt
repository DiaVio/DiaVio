The driver admitted to consuming alcohol both on the night before the crash and just before the crash itself. This impaired his ability to operate the vehicle as required. Additionally, the driver mentioned feeling tired prior to the crash, which could have further compromised his alertness and reaction time. The fact that he was actually asleep at the time of the critical pre-crash event indicates a severe lack of attention and control over the vehicle. Furthermore, the driver's statement about losing steering control and the vehicle not responding suggests a possible mechanical issue with the vehicle. However, it is important to note that the driver had recently made modifications to the vehicle by installing aftermarket tires and wheels. This raises the possibility that the modifications may have contributed to the loss of control. Overall, the combination of alcohol consumption, fatigue, and potential vehicle modifications points to the driver of V1 as primarily responsible for the accident.
