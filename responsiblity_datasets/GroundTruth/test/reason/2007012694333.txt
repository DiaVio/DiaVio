The driver of V1 failed to stop for a red light and entered the intersection, causing the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt). Additionally, after the collision, the driver of V1 fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and their subsequent decision to leave the scene make them primarily responsible for the accident.
