The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the roadway before crossing. They did not see the large truck exiting the driveway on the east side and proceeded to cross the roadway without ensuring it was clear. This lack of surveillance and failure to look or see the oncoming truck led to the collision. V2 (the driver of the 1994 Ford 3/4 ton pickup) attempted to steer right to avoid the crash but was unable to do so due to V1's sudden entry into their path. V2's actions indicate an attempt to avoid the collision, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly surveying the roadway before crossing.
