The driver of V1 was cited for failure to use due care and failure to maintain control. She admitted to having an argument with her boyfriend, who may have been the actual driver of the truck. Additionally, the truck had illegal tires that were not the recommended size. These factors, including the driver's poor directional control, contribute to V1's responsibility for the crash.
