The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and turned left (north) in front of V2 (the driver of the 2006 Chevrolet G3500 van), causing the collision. V2 had the right of way as they were traveling straight in the southbound lane. V2 stated that they saw V1 stopped at the intersection and applied the brakes when they noticed V1 entering the intersection. Although V1's memory of the crash is limited and the specific type of driver error is unknown, the fact remains that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
