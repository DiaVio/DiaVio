The reason for this is that V2 departed the lane to the left in the curve, causing the back trailer to slide laterally into the opposite lane. The front left corner of V1, the 2005 Lincoln Town Car, impacted the left side of the trailer near the back tires, resulting in severe damage to V1 and causing it to rotate counterclockwise on impact. V2's departure from its lane and the subsequent sliding of the trailer into the opposite lane created a hazardous situation that directly led to the collision.
