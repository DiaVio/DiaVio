The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V2 admitted to looking at her turn destination just prior to the crash, indicating a lack of attention to the immediate surroundings. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V1, which was traveling straight in its designated lane.
