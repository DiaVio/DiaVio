The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 lost control of the vehicle and crossed the center line, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. - The driver of V1 admitted to drinking prior to the crash, which impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver of V1 was distracted by reaching into her purse, which further contributed to the loss of control. - The driver of V1 was not comfortable with the vehicle due to alignment problems, suggesting a lack of familiarity and potentially inadequate maintenance. - The excessive speed of V1, as indicated by the police-reported travel speed of 97 kmph in a posted speed limit of 88 kmph, was a contributing factor to the crash. Overall, the combination of impaired driving, distraction, lack of vehicle familiarity, and excessive speed makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
