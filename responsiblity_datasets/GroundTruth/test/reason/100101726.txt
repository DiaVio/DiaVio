The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 experienced a tire tread separation, which caused the vehicle to make sudden movements and lose control. The driver's reaction of steering sharply to the left and braking in an attempt to stop in the median further contributed to the rollover sequence. Additionally, the fact that the second row center passenger in V1 was not belted and was fully ejected during the sequence indicates a lack of proper safety measures within the vehicle.
