The driver of V1 reported that a deer ran out in front of his vehicle, causing him to steer to avoid it. However, the critical reason for the crash was coded as the driver's error of overcompensation. This suggests that the driver's reaction to the deer was excessive, leading to the loss of control and subsequent rollover of V1. Additionally, the wet road conditions due to rain were coded as an associated factor, further contributing to the driver's loss of control. It is also mentioned that V1 had suspension and tire deficiencies, which were coded as contributing factors. Overall, while the presence of a deer in the roadway may have initiated the sequence of events, it was the driver's overcompensation and the combination of wet road conditions and vehicle deficiencies that ultimately led to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
