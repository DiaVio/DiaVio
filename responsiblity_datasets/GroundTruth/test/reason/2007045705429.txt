The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control. The driver stated that she was talking to her passenger and the right tires of V1 went off the edge of the road. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the road and was coded as inattentive. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
