The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was aware of the bald rear tires and did not reduce her speed for the wet roadway while negotiating a curve. This indicates a failure to exercise caution and adapt to the road conditions, which ultimately led to the loss of traction, sliding into the guardrail, and subsequent rollover. Additionally, the tread depth measurements of the rear tires further highlight the negligence on the part of the driver in maintaining the vehicle's safety.
