The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep while driving. This indicates a clear driver-related factor that directly contributed to the crash. The driver's fatigue and lack of attention caused them to fail to stop at the red light and collide with the back of vehicle two (V2).
