The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was driven by a 17-year-old male who did not have a driver's license. - The driver admitted to borrowing the vehicle without permission. - It was the driver's first time driving this vehicle. - V1's driver stated that another vehicle was driving erratically next to him, causing the control loss, but this could not be verified. - The driver's statement suggests that he may have been distracted or not fully in control of the vehicle. - The driver's performance error of overcompensation led to the critical pre-crash event of traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. - The driver's estimated travel and impact speeds of 35 mph indicate that he was likely exceeding the posted speed limit of 45 mph. Overall, V1's driver's lack of experience, lack of a driver's license, and potential distractions or lack of control contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
