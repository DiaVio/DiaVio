The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver by failing to stop for the traffic control signal. The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that the signal was orange when he went through the intersection, indicating that he did not stop in time. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to look far enough ahead, which suggests a lack of attention and awareness while driving. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (the Ford Explorer) was stopped at the traffic control and proceeded to turn left when the signal turned green. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their illegal maneuver and failure to stop for the traffic control signal.
