The reason for this is that V1 was initiating a left turn from the east side of the northbound lanes, crossing the southbound lanes, when the collision occurred with V2 (the Honda Civic). V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, which was traveling in the southbound lane. Additionally, V1's inexperience as a new driver and discomfort with the heavy traffic and speeds in that area contributed to the misjudgment.
