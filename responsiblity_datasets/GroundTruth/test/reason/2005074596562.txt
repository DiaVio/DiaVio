The reason for this is that V1 ran a red traffic signal, indicating a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by reaching down to grab a soda, taking his eyes off the roadway. These actions demonstrate negligence and a failure to exercise proper caution while driving. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Infiniti QX4) was simply crossing the intersection on a green light, indicating that they were following traffic laws and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's violation of traffic laws and distraction are the primary factors that led to the accident, making them primarily responsible.
