The reason for this is that V2 turned left from a business driveway in front of and across the path of V1, causing V1 to swerve and lose control. V1's driver reported that he tried to avoid the collision by steering left and braking, but ultimately lost control of the vehicle. Therefore, the actions of V2 in turning across the path of V1 were the initiating factor that led to the crash.
