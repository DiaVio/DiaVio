The reason for this is that V2 was following too closely behind Vehicle three (V3), the 2001 Honda Accord sedan, and failed to maintain a safe distance. As a result, V2 collided with the back of V3 when it started to decelerate to make a right turn. This initial collision caused V2 to lose control and cross over three lanes of traffic, ultimately resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle one (V1), the 2006 Hyundai Accent sedan. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe following distance and subsequent loss of control led to the accident.
