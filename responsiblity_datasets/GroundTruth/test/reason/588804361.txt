The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway for unknown reasons and then oversteered, crossing over into the southbound travel lane. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan) collided with the right side of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 1 initiated the sequence of events leading to the collision.
