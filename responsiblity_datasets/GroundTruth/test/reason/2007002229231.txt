The driver of Vehicle #1 was cited for inadequate surveillance, indicating that they failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn at the intersection. This failure to adequately survey the roadway and properly judge the distance and speed of Vehicle #2 (2002 Honda Accord) led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 claimed that tree foliage obstructed their view, but it was confirmed that there were no trees in the immediate area and low shrubs did not block the view. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to properly survey the intersection and accurately judge the oncoming traffic.
