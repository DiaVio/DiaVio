The reason for this is that V1 was approaching the intersection where V2 was stopped, preparing to turn left. V1 accelerated and then braked hard, causing the vehicle to skid and collide with the back of V2. The driver of V1 stated that the vehicle had been stalling throughout the day, and she had to step on the gas each time to keep the engine running. This indicates a vehicle-related factor and a performance error on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only been driving for 18 months and did not have formal driver's education, suggesting inexperience as a contributing factor. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was stopped at the intersection, waiting to turn left, and had no time for avoidance maneuvers. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane-other vehicle traveling in the same direction with higher speed," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the vehicle-related factor of continued stalling, the performance error of accelerating initially instead of braking, and the driver's inexperience.
