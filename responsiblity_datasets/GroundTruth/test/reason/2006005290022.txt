The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. Even though V2 had its emergency lights on and was responding to a fire, it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to make the turn. V1 (the driver of the Chevrolet Malibu) was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event coded to V2 was "false assumption of others actions." This suggests that V2 may have incorrectly assumed that V1 would yield or take evasive action, leading to the collision. Overall, V2's failure to yield and false assumption of others' actions make them primarily responsible for the crash.
