The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to take correct evasive action when he became aware of the disabled vehicle ahead. Instead of lightly applying the brakes and steering right, the driver abruptly applied the brakes, causing the vehicle to slide off the road and collide with a concrete bus stop bench and a light pole. If the driver had taken the correct evasive action, the brakes would not have locked up and he could have maintained control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver failed to look far enough ahead to see the disabled vehicle, which further contributed to the accident.
