The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle veering off the roadway and impacting the berm on the right shoulder. Additionally, after the impact, the driver overcompensated by steering to the left, which caused the vehicle to roll over. These actions indicate poor directional control and a failure to handle the vehicle with the skill expected of a driver.
