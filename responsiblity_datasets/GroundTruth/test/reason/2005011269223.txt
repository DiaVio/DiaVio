The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy conditions. The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was 'this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions,' and the Critical Reason coded to the driver of V1 was 'Decision Error-too fast for icy conditions.' The driver admitted during the interview that she did not realize the road was icy and needed to go slower. This lack of awareness and failure to adjust her speed accordingly led to the loss of control of her vehicle, crossing the centerline, and ultimately colliding with V2.
