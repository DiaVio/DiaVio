The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to give full time and attention, resulting in a decision error and inattention. This is evident from the driver's statement that she lost contact with the road and veered left into the wall, indicating a lack of attention and control over the vehicle. Additionally, the witness's account suggests that the driver may have been asleep or drowsy, further supporting the driver's inattention as a contributing factor to the accident.
