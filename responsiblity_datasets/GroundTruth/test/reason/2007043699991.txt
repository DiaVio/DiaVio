The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and the Critical Reason identified for V2 was "inadequate surveillance." This suggests that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated that V2 was traveling at 0 kmph (stopped) at the time of the impact, while V1 was traveling at 48 kmph (30 mph). This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the head-on collision.
