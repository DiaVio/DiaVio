The driver of Vehicle #1 abruptly changed lanes to the right, resulting in a loss of control and subsequent collision with the center barrier wall. The driver's decision to change lanes was influenced by an incident where another driver allegedly "flipped him off" for going too slow in the left lane. The driver's attempt to regain control by steering left resulted in overcompensation, causing the vehicle to depart the left side of the road and collide with the wall. The driver's failure to maintain control and improper tag were also charged by the police.
