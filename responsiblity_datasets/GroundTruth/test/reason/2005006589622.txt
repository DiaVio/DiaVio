The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which caused the vehicle to drift off the road and collide with a tree and guardrail. The driver stated that he was tired from studying and had been awake for seven hours at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver was traveling over the speed limit, which further contributed to the accident. The critical pre-crash event was coded as V1 going off the edge of the road on the left side, and the critical reason was identified as the driver being asleep. The driver's fatigue, combined with driving over the speed limit and engaging in strenuous non-work activities, all played a role in the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's negligence in falling asleep while driving and failing to maintain control of the vehicle.
