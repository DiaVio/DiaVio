The reason for this is that V3 was traveling behind Vehicle 2 (V2) and struck the front of V2, causing V2 to be forced into the southbound lane where it impacted the front of Vehicle 1 (V1) as it entered the intersection. This indicates that V3 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the chain reaction collision.
