The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they turned left with an obstructed view. Even though another vehicle waved V1 through, it was ultimately V1's responsibility to ensure that it was safe to make the left turn. V1 failed to properly assess the situation and did not see V2 approaching until the last second, resulting in the collision. V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) was traveling in their designated lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the accident.
