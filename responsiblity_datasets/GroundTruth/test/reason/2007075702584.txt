The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before turning right. The driver was distracted by eating a bagel, stressed, in a hurry, and lost in thought about personal concerns. Despite blaming the icy roadway conditions, V1 failed to detect V2 approaching from the left. This failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
