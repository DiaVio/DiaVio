The driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline, depart the pavement, and penetrate a wooded area, ultimately colliding with a large diameter tree. This initial impact (Event 1) did not alter V1's trajectory, and it continued to collide with another large diameter tree (Event 3). The subsequent rollover (Event 4) was a result of the vehicle's rotation off the struck trees and the environmental slope of the wooded area. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and allowing it to leave the roadway, resulting in the subsequent collisions and rollover.
