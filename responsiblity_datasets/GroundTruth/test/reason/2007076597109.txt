The reason for this is that V1 was cited for extreme DUI and was driving at a speed higher than the posted limit. V1 failed to adjust their speed accordingly when V2 (the 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme sedan) began to slow down to execute a right-hand turn. As a result, V1 impacted the rear of V2, pushing it off the road and causing the accident.
