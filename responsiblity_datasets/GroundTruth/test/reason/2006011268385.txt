The driver of V1 failed to recognize the red traffic signal and mistakenly believed that he had a green light. This was due to his distraction caused by reaching for a cigarette and talking to his wife, as well as his unfamiliarity with the local traffic signal system. As a result, V1 accelerated forward without looking up and collided with the back of V2, which was still stopped at the intersection.
