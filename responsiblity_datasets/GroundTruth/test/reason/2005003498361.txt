The driver of Vehicle # 2 was under the influence of alcohol and fell asleep while driving, resulting in the vehicle swerving into the westbound lanes and colliding with Vehicle # 1. This driver-related factor, combined with the critical pre-crash event of the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side, clearly indicates that Vehicle # 2's driver was at fault for the accident.
