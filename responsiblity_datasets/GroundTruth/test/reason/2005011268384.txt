The driver of V1 stopped at the stop sign but failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that the two wooden utility poles on the northwest corner might have obstructed his view of the oncoming V2. However, it was determined that if the driver had double-checked before pulling into the intersection, he would have seen V2. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1 led to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2003 Mercury Sable) was traveling at a reasonable speed and attempted to avoid the crash by pulling the steering wheel to the right. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance at the intersection.
