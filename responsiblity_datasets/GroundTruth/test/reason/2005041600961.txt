The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as it had been raining off and on and the roads were slick. The driver of V1 stated that he estimated his speed to be around 32kmph (20 mph), which is significantly slower than the posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). However, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 105 kmph, indicating that V1 was actually traveling at the posted speed limit. Additionally, V1 was following too closely in heavy rush hour traffic, which further contributed to the crash. The driver of V1 also mentioned that he was not very comfortable with the rental car, having only driven it twice. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2002 Chevy Express Van 2500) was stopped in the exit lane with traffic, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions and following too closely in heavy traffic.
