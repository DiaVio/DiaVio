The reason for this is that V1's driver failed to exercise proper directional control when encountering the group of wild pigs on the road. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle and safely maneuvering around the animals, the driver steered to the right to avoid them and then overcorrected by steering left, resulting in the right side of V1 striking a guardrail. Additionally, the driver stated that she did not realize she was so close to the guardrail when returning to the road, indicating a lack of awareness and attention to her surroundings. Therefore, V1's driver's poor directional control and lack of awareness contributed to the accident, making her primarily responsible.
