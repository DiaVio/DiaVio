The driver of V1 was not paying attention to the vehicle ahead of him and failed to recognize that it had stopped. This recognition error, caused by an external distraction of looking at approaching traffic to his left, led to the collision with the back of V2. The driver of V2 was stopped at a red light and was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
