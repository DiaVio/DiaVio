The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the fact that the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 mentioned that she started turning right after the non-contact vehicle in front of her turned and was looking to her left while making the turn. However, the forward non-contact vehicle partially blocked her view of V2's approach. Despite this obstruction, the driver of V1 proceeded to turn left without taking any avoidance action, resulting in the collision with V2.
