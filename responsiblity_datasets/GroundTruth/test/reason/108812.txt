The reason for this is that the driver of V2 drifted to the left, crossed the centerline, and entered the eastbound lane of travel, causing the collision with vehicle one (V1). The driver of V1 attempted to avoid V2 by steering right, indicating that they were in their own lane and taking appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V2 for crossing into the oncoming lane.
