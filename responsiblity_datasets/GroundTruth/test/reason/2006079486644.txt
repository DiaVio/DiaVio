The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the distance and speed of V2 while attempting to make a left turn. This indicates a driver-related decision error, specifically a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle. V2, the driver of the Honda Accord, reported seeing V1 execute the turn but did not have sufficient time to react. Therefore, the critical reason for the event was not attributed to V2.
