The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated after the right front tire departed the right side of the road. This oversteering caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, leading to the subsequent events of striking a big rock and rolling onto its rooftop. The police reported travel speed of 64 kmph also suggests that V1 was likely traveling above the posted speed limit, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle.
