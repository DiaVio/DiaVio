The reason for this is that V1 was traveling east in the eastbound lane when the driver noticed a deer in V1's travel lane. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle and safely avoiding the deer, the driver attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, resulting in V1 contacting the deer with its front. Furthermore, after the initial impact with the deer, V1 continued to make additional contact with the deer on its right side. The driver then steered hard left in an attempt to maneuver the vehicle back onto the road, but V1 crossed the center lane line and continued across the opposing lane onto the left roadside. Ultimately, V1 contacted a ditch with its undercarriage and a tree with its front, causing serious injuries to the unrestrained right front male passenger. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and make appropriate decisions to avoid the collision, leading to the subsequent impacts and injuries.
