The reason for this is that V1 was experiencing a diabetic attack, which impaired her ability to act and control her vehicle. This is evident from her statement that she had taken more medication than usual for diabetes that morning because her blood sugar level was too high. Additionally, she almost hit pedestrians prior to the crash, indicating that her impaired condition was affecting her driving ability. Therefore, V1's physical impairment due to the diabetic attack is the primary reason for the accident.
