The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway and did not see V2 and V3 decelerating in lane one. This lack of surveillance and awareness led to V1 colliding with the rear of V2, initiating the chain reaction of collisions. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she may have been distracted by conversation with her occupants, further contributing to her failure to notice the decelerating vehicles in front of her.
