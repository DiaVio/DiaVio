The reason for V1's responsibility is the critical non-performance error, specifically a "heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act." This impairment caused the driver to lose consciousness and drive off the right side of the roadway, resulting in the collision with V2, the Isuzu Amigo, and subsequently striking multiple trees before coming to a rest.
