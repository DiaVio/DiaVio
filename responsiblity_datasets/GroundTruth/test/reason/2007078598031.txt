The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 coming from the opposite direction. This misjudgment led to V1 turning into the path of V2, resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes, indicating that she was aware of V1's presence and took appropriate action. Therefore, V2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the accident. It is important to note that V3 was not involved in the first harmful event and the critical reason for the pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle.
