The reason for this is that V1's driver admitted to falling asleep prior to the first impact, which was confirmed by a positive test for opiates in her medical record. Falling asleep while driving is a clear driver-related factor and a critical pre-crash event. Additionally, V1's vehicle was observed traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. While V2 (the driver of the 2003 Freightliner tractor/trailer) was involved in the crash, there is no evidence to suggest that V2 was at fault. V2's driver stated that he did not see V1 prior to the first impact, suggesting that V1's actions were unexpected and not easily avoidable. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's sleepiness and failure to maintain proper lane position.
