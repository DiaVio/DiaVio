The critical pre-crash event for V1 was that it was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. This indicates that V1 was not able to slow down in time when traffic ahead came to a fast stop, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the rear of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and adjust speed accordingly makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
