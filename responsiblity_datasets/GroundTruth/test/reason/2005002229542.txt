The driver of Vehicle #1 made a driver-related decision error by traveling too fast for the conditions and choosing an inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action. The driver steered to the left and locked up the brakes in an attempt to avoid a collision with Vehicle #2, which was making a left turn onto the side road. However, if the driver had simply braked in their lane without steering to the left, it is likely that Vehicle #2 would have completed its turn with no impact. Therefore, Vehicle #1's driver's actions of traveling too fast for the conditions and choosing an unsuccessful evasive action contributed to the crash, making them primarily responsible.
