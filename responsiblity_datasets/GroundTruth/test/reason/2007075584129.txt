The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by reaching down to the floor to move the ratchet bar. This distraction caused him to not notice that V2 had stopped in front of him, resulting in the collision. V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Grand Prix) is not primarily responsible as she was stopped for traffic and unable to move forward due to the vehicles in front of her. Although V2 was traveling at a slower speed than V1, this alone does not make her primarily responsible for the accident.
