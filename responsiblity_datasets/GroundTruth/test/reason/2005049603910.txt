The reason for this is that V1 hit a patch of ice on the roadway, causing it to depart the road to the right and ultimately collide with a tree. The critical reason for the crash was determined to be the slick roads and low friction due to ice. Although it is undetermined if the driver was not driving in accordance with a reasonable standard of safe driving for the conditions present, the fact that V1 lost control on the iced roadway suggests that the driver may not have been exercising enough caution or adjusting their driving behavior to account for the icy conditions.
