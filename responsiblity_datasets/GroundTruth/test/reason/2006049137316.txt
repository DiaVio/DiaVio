The reason for this is as follows: - V1 attempted a right turn from the third lane, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1 lost directional control of the vehicle and crossed over multiple lanes, indicating poor control of the vehicle. - The driver of V1 is not licensed to drive, suggesting a lack of proper training and experience. - The driver of V1 stated that she was trying to avoid another vehicle that did not exist, indicating a possible distraction or lack of attention. These factors collectively point to V1 as the primarily responsible party for the accident.
