The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver of V1 stated that he applied the brakes to avoid V2 but slid on the wet pavement. Additionally, the driver admitted that the brakes on his vehicle were deficient. These factors indicate that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and did not have proper control of his vehicle, which ultimately led to the collision with V2.
