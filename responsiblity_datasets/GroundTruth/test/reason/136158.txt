The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the elderly driver of V1 reportedly lapsed into a semi-conscious state, possibly due to low blood sugar, and relinquished control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 drifting off the road, striking multiple mailboxes, crossing into the opposite lane narrowly missing another vehicle, and ultimately crashing into trees. The driver's loss of consciousness and failure to maintain control of the vehicle directly led to the series of events that caused the accident.
