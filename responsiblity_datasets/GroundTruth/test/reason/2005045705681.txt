The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 pulled out of a private lot on the west side of the roadway in an attempt to turn left. The driver of Vehicle #2 misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #1 (the 1984 Pontiac Parisienne) traveling south on the roadway. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that she thought it was okay to go because Vehicle #1's right turn signal was on, indicating that he was going to turn into the parking lot she was exiting. However, this assumption was not reliable. Therefore, Vehicle #2's decision error and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed led to the collision, making Vehicle #2 primarily responsible for the accident.
