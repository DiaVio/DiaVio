The reason for this is that the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted and looking down inside the car prior to seeing the brake lights up ahead. This internal distraction caused her to be unable to stop in time and resulted in her rear-ending V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned being uncomfortable with the steering of the vehicle, which could have contributed to her inability to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors, including distraction and potential issues with vehicle control.
