The driver of V1 stated that V2 and V3 applied their brakes unexpectedly and with great force when the traffic light turned from green to amber. However, the critical reason for V1's involvement in the accident was that they were traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to slow down in time to avoid colliding with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe speed and distance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
