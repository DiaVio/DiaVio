The driver of V2 stated that he did not see V1 before initiating the left turn. This indicates inadequate surveillance on his part, as he failed to look or look but did not see the oncoming vehicle. This lack of attention and failure to yield the right-of-way to V1 resulted in the collision. Additionally, the associated factor of a tire deficiency in V2, with one tire having low tread, may have contributed to the driver's inability to properly control the vehicle during the turn. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way.
