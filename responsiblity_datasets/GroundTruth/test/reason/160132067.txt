The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, which resulted in the front of V1, the 2002 Honda Accord sedan, contacting the front of V2. Making a left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic is a violation of traffic rules and is considered a primary cause of accidents in such scenarios.
