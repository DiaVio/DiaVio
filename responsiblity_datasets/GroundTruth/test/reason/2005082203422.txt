The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was inattentive (daydreaming) while driving. Additionally, the driver stated that her stress level was extremely high and she had only slept for two hours. She also mentioned feeling drowsy and fatigued at the start of the trip. The driver's drowsiness and fatigue, combined with the medication Alprazolam, which can cause tiredness, drowsiness, and an inability to concentrate, likely impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle.
