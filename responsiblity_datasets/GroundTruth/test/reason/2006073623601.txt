The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming at the time of the accident. She stated that she looked left and right but failed to see the other vehicle, believing it was blended into the background. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of vehicle one. On the other hand, there is no known pre-crash information or statement from the driver of vehicle two. However, a police officer at the scene mentioned that driver two expressed surprise at vehicle one's sudden movement. This suggests that driver two was not at fault and was likely following the rules of the road. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and failure to yield the right of way.
