The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without realizing that the traffic light had not changed. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and daydreaming about a church member's problem at the time of the crash. This indicates that the driver was not paying attention to the road and failed to notice the red light. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe) stated that she knew her traffic signal was green and applied the brakes at the last minute when V1 entered the intersection. This suggests that V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to obey the traffic signal make them primarily responsible for the accident.
