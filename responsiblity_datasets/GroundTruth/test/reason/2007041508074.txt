The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was not attentive to the driving task due to being distracted by plugging her cell phone into the car charger. This distraction caused her to fail to recognize that the driver of V2 had come to a complete stop at the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption that the other driver would continue forward without stopping. These factors led to V1 colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related recognition error and internal distraction, as well as the decision-related false assumption.
