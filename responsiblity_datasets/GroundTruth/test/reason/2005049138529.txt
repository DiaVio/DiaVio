The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck by V2 (the driver of the 1988 Honda CRX) who was approaching the intersection in the correct lane. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn, which is a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, V1 was distracted by a phone conversation, which further contributed to the driver's inattention and failure to properly assess the situation. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and distracted driving are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the accident.
