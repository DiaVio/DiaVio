The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn from the westbound lane, crossing the path of V2 (the 1996 Honda Civic) which was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in a collision between the two vehicles. V2, on the other hand, detected V1 early but assumed that V1 would yield the right of way at the intersection. Therefore, while V2 may have contributed to the accident by not taking appropriate evasive action, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an improper left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic.
