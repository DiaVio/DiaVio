The driver of Vehicle one attempted to make an illegal maneuver by turning left from the right lane, which is clearly marked for right turns only. This illegal maneuver put Vehicle one in the path of Vehicle two, resulting in the collision. While Vehicle two (the driver of the 1992 Kenworth tractor/trailer) did encroach over the right lane line, it is important to note that Vehicle one's illegal maneuver was the critical reason for the accident. Additionally, Vehicle two did not see Vehicle one due to the design of his vehicle, which suggests that Vehicle one's illegal maneuver caught Vehicle two by surprise. Therefore, Vehicle one's illegal maneuver and failure to follow the designated lane markings make them primarily responsible for the accident.
