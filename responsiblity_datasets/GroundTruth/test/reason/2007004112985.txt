The driver of V1 was engaged in conversation or joking around with the passengers in the car, which led to internal distraction and inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 claimed to have never seen V2 coming up the hill and proceeded to make the left turn, assuming the intersection was clear. This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the situation resulted in V1 turning left in front of V2, causing the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors such as internal distraction, inadequate surveillance, and inexperience.
