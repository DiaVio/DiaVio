Reason: V1 was traveling at a high speed of 72 kph (45 mph) in heavy rush hour traffic and attempted to "catch the light" by accelerating when the light changed from green to yellow. V1 failed to anticipate the possibility of other vehicles, such as V2, turning left in front of him. This driver's false assumption and excessive speed for the conditions led to the head-on collision with V2.
