The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that initiated the collision by moving out of its travel lane to the right and impacting the back of Vehicle 2 (V2), the legally parked and unoccupied 1992 BMW 525i four door station wagon. This initial impact caused a chain reaction, with V2 then striking the back of Vehicle 4 (V4), the legally parked and unoccupied 2005 Toyota Camry four door sedan. Additionally, V1 continued to travel off the roadway and collided with Vehicle 3 (V3), the legally parked and unoccupied 1993 Chevrolet Corvette two door coupe, causing minor damage to both vehicles. Therefore, V1's actions of moving out of its travel lane and causing the initial collision make it primarily responsible for the accident.
