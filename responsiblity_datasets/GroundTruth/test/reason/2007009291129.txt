The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was driving under the influence of alcohol, which impaired their ability to operate the vehicle safely. - V1 was involved in a previous rear-end collision and attempted to flee the scene. - V1 was driving at a high speed, exceeding the posted speed limit. - V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered onto the median, knocking down a tree. - V1 then became airborne and collided with V2, causing V2 to spin and come to a rest. These factors indicate that V1's aggressive driving behavior, impaired state, and disregard for traffic laws contributed to the accident.
