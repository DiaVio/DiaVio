The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 experienced a loss of control due to the icy and snow-covered roadway surface, causing it to slide sideways into the left westbound travel lane where Vehicle 1 (2010 Honda Civic 4-door sedan) was approaching. The collision occurred when the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the right side plane of Vehicle 2. Therefore, Vehicle 2's loss of control and subsequent slide into the opposing lane led to the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
