The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and Vehicle 1 (the Ford Mustang) was traveling straight in its lane. Vehicle 2 turned into the path of Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the Critical Reason for Vehicle 2 was a driver-related factor of an unknown recognition error. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to recognize the oncoming Vehicle 1 and made the left turn without yielding the right of way. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error in judgment and failure to yield.
