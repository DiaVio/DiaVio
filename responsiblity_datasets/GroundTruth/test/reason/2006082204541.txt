The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was driving too fast for the wet road conditions, which is a driver-related factor. This is evident from the fact that V1 lost control and departed the roadway after avoiding a non-contact vehicle. Additionally, the report mentions that V1 had very little tread on three of its tires, and the left rear tire was a completely bald temporary spare tire. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 did not take proper precautions to ensure the safety of their vehicle and adjust their driving behavior accordingly.
