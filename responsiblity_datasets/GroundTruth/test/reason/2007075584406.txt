The driver of V1 reported being cut off by a non-contact vehicle, but the researcher believes that the driver was driving too fast to negotiate the curve. The vehicle inspection revealed that the right side tires were overinflated and the left rear tire was underinflated, which could have contributed to poor directional control. Additionally, the driver was not familiar with the area and may have failed to look far enough ahead. These factors, combined with the driver's inexperience and discomfort with general traffic speeds, likely led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and causing the accident.
