The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption that V2 (the Cadillac Catera) would merge without stopping on the on-ramp. These factors indicate that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to anticipate the possibility of V2 stopping, leading to the collision.
