The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the witness reported that the driver of V1 was traveling well beyond the speed limit and was attempting to change lanes when the crash occurred. Additionally, V1 entered the left shoulder and struck the concrete barrier, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. The fact that V1 re-entered the traffic lanes and came to a rest perpendicular across the expressway further suggests a lack of proper lane change execution. Therefore, V1's excessive speed, improper lane change, and failure to maintain control of the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the crash.
