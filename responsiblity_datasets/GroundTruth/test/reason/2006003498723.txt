The reason for this is that V2 attempted to pass a slower moving non-contact vehicle by crossing the double yellow line and entering the lane of travel of V1. This illegal maneuver resulted in the left side of V2 sideswiping the left side of V1. V1's driver stated that V2 crossed into his lane from the opposite direction and he attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the crash, indicating that V2's actions were the cause of the collision. Additionally, V2's driver received a citation for being unable to provide proof of insurance and being unlicensed, further indicating his responsibility in the accident.
