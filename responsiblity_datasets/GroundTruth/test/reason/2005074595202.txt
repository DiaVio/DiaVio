The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the intersection before making the left turn, leading to the collision with V1. Additionally, the associative factors mentioned in the summary further support V2's responsibility. The driver of V1 assumed that V2 would stay stopped at the stop sign and not enter the intersection, indicating that V2 had the obligation to yield to oncoming traffic. Furthermore, the driver of V2 was clinically depressed and taking medication, which may have affected their reactions and responses, potentially contributing to the inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the situation before making the left turn. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic.
