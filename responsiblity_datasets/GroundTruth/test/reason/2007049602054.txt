The reason for this is that V1 was driving too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others. The driver of V1 stated that he couldn't stop his vehicle in time to avoid the crash, indicating that he was not able to react appropriately to the slowing and stopped vehicles ahead of him. This suggests that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or paying enough attention to the road conditions, resulting in the collision with the back of V2 and subsequently pushing V2 into the back of V3.
