The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Ford F-550 pickup truck towing the wood chipper, was backing across both east and west lanes of travel without yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic. V2 assumed that V1, the Toyota Camry, would yield to the emergency flashing lights. However, V2 failed to properly assess the situation and make sure it was safe to proceed with the maneuver. This resulted in V1 colliding with the wood chipper, causing major damage to V1 and injuring its driver. Additionally, factors associated with V2's responsibility include alcohol involvement, as well as the driver's distraction caused by watching the chipper in her side mirror. These factors further contribute to V2's primary responsibility for the accident.
