The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe distance and speed for the road conditions. The driver stated that they were traveling at a speed of less than 30 mph (48 kph) and had a distance of 2-car length (9 meters/30 feet) between their vehicle and V2. However, the driver of V1 was unable to respond to the unexpected action of V2 stopping, indicating that they were traveling too fast to be able to react in time. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead, which is a driver-related error. While congested traffic, rain, and wet roads were contributing factors, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their speed and maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
