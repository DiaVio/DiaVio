The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making her left turn. This is evident from the fact that she did not see V2 until just before impact, indicating that she did not look far enough ahead. Additionally, the officer at the scene reported that V1 was distracted by a loose dog in the car and was upset about losing her cell phone. These factors likely contributed to her inadequate surveillance and ultimately led to the collision.
