The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was impaired with a BAC result of .19, which is well above the legal limit. This impaired condition likely contributed to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the left turn being made at an inappropriate time. Additionally, the wet roads and rain may have further impaired V1's ability to make a safe left turn. V2 (the driver of the Toyota Tacoma) is not primarily responsible for the accident, as there is no indication of any fault or contributing factors on their part. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroaching from opposite direction-over left lane line," suggesting that V2 was driving within their lane and did not contribute to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to impaired driving and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed.
