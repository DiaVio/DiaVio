The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 allowed their vehicle to enter the northbound lane, crossing the path of Vehicle 1. This resulted in the collision between the front left areas of both vehicles, causing moderate damage. The fact that Vehicle 2 entered the wrong lane and impacted Vehicle 1 indicates that the driver of Vehicle 2 was at fault for the accident.
