The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing. The driver stated that he did not see Vehicle two when he went to cross the second half of the intersection. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness on the part of the driver of Vehicle one, leading to the collision with Vehicle two.
