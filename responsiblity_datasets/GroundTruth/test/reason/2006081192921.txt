The driver of V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. Despite looking, the driver did not see V2 (the 1983 Chevrolet Malibu station wagon) traveling westbound and crossed the turn lane markings, resulting in a head-on collision with V2. This failure to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
