The driver of V1 admitted that he thought the left-turn arrow turned green and proceeded to enter the intersection. However, the police report states that the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, it was determined that the vehicles parked in the gas station lot did not obstruct the view of the westbound traffic, contradicting the driver's claim. This further supports the conclusion that V1 did not adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
