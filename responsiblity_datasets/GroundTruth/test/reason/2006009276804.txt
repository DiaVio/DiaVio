The driver of V1 admitted that she was looking at the wrong light when she entered the intersection and proceeded to turn left, thinking the light was green. This indicates that she failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the turn, resulting in the collision with V2. Reason: V1 failed to exercise proper surveillance and did not pay attention to the correct traffic signal, leading to the collision with V2.
