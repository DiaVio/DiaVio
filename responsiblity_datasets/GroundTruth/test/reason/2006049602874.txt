The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at a business in the northeast corner of the intersection and thinking about a medical appointment. This external distraction caused the driver to fail to recognize the green light for V2 and V3, resulting in V1 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so.
