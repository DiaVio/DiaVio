The reason for this is that V2 struck the case vehicle (V1) on the right side doors, causing both vehicles to rotate. This initial impact was the catalyst for the subsequent collision between V1 and Vehicle 3 (V3), the 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan. Therefore, V2's actions directly led to the secondary collision and the resulting injuries to the case occupant.
