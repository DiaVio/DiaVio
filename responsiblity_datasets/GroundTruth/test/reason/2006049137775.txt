The reason for V1's responsibility is that they attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Ford F-250) without yielding the right of way. V1 was in a lane that was not designated as a turn lane, and their maneuver was deemed illegal. This illegal maneuver by V1 directly led to the collision with V2 and subsequent events.
