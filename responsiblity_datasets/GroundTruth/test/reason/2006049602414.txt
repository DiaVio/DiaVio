The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by observing the trailer he was towing and failed to notice that V2 (the 1995 Mercury Villager) was stalled in the lane ahead. This recognition error led to V1 being too close to V2 to prevent the front impact. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper attention and awareness of the road conditions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
