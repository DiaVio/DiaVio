The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. The driver of V1 stated that she looked left and right before entering the intersection but did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
