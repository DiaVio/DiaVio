The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating that V2 changed lanes to the right and encroached into the lane of V1. This suggests that V2 failed to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that he does not feel comfortable driving large vans, which may have contributed to his inadequate surveillance and failure to notice V1 in the adjacent lane.
