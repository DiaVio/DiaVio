The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a performance error by overcompensating when the vehicle hit something in the road. This caused V1 to veer off the road onto the left shoulder, and then overcorrect to the right, ultimately resulting in V1 crossing lane one and leaving the road on the right side. The driver's statement that if she had just steered right slightly when the vehicle went onto the left shoulder, she probably would not have crashed further supports V1's responsibility. Additionally, factors such as the driver's unfamiliarity with the road and the possible side effects of her prescribed medication for Lupus (dizziness and sensitivity to sunlight) were also contributing factors to the driver's performance error. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
