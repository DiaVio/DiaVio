The driver of V1 misjudged the gap between his vehicle and V2 (the 1993 Freightliner truck tractor pulling a flatbed trailer) when attempting to pass on the left. He also misjudged the speed of V2. As a result, V1 accelerated and steered left, causing the front of his vehicle to strike the rear of the trailer on V2. This initial impact then led to V1 colliding with V3 (the 1993 Kenworth tractor pulling an empty reefer unit). The driver of V2, on the other hand, was not found to be at fault for the crash.
