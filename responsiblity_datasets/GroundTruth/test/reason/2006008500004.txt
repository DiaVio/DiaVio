The reason for V1's primary responsibility is due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, aggressive driving behavior, and the fact that the driver was under the influence of alcohol (cited for DUI). These factors contributed to V1 crossing into the second lane in front of another vehicle, making a sharp left turn into a gas station in front of V2, and ultimately colliding with V2.
