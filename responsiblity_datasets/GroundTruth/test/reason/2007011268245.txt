The driver of V1 failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being "poor directional control." The driver made a decision error by remaining in the center of the road on the crest of the hill when she could not see traffic on the other side. This decision, combined with the icy road conditions, led to V1 sliding and fishtailing multiple times, ultimately resulting in the collision with a tree. Contributing factors such as inexperience (the driver had only been licensed for thirteen months) and being in a hurry (running late for school) further demonstrate the driver's lack of judgment and responsibility. Additionally, factors like fatigue (due to a hectic week with a school play) and low tire pressure on the right side tires may have also played a role in the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor decision-making, lack of control, and failure to adapt to the road conditions.
