The reason for this is that V2 was traveling east in the second lane of the highway at an unknown rate of speed when its right front tire blew out, causing the driver to lose control. V2 then traveled into the right turn lane and continued forward across the private drive, ultimately striking V1 in the left front quarter panel. This indicates that V2 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the collision.
