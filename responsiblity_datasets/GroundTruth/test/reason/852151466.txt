The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the right onto the shoulder and partially off the road edge, ultimately impacting the end of a steel guard rail. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the guard rail. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 sustained significant damage and had to be towed, further suggesting that the driver was at fault for the accident.
