The reason for this is that the driver of V1 noticed V2 decelerating at the last moment and attempted to avoid impact by steering left and applying brakes. However, V1 still ended up colliding with the rear of V2 and then crossed the left lane line, contacting the left rear of V3. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control and avoid the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
