The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 prior to initiating the turn, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming traffic. This failure to look and properly assess the situation led to V1 turning in front of V2, resulting in the collision. While V2 (the driver of the 2000 Pontiac) also had an associated factor of a false assumption that V1 would yield the right-of-way, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
