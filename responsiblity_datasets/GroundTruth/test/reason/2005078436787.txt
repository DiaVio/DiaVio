The reason for this is that V1 drifted into the westbound lane, colliding with V2 (the maroon and tan Dodge Ram 250). The V1 driver admitted to police that she does not remember what happened but does remember turning onto the road to sleep. Additionally, a urine sample taken from the V1 driver tested positive for amphetamines and marijuana, and substances were found inside the vehicle that tested positive for methamphetamine and marijuana. There was no evidence of braking by V1 prior to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired state and failure to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with V2.
