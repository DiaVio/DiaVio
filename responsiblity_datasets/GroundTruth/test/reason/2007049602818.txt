The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as "inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see." This indicates that V1 did not properly assess the situation before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Kia Sorento) stated that he did not observe V1 before it appeared in front of him, suggesting that V1's actions were unexpected and not easily avoidable. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the oncoming traffic and ensure it was safe to make the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
