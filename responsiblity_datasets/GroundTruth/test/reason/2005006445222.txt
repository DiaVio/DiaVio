The reason for this is that V2, the Isuzu Rodeo, was traveling west on the east/west roadway and pulled out onto the north/south roadway, intending to turn left. V1, the Ford Taurus, was already traveling north on the north/south roadway when V2 pulled out in front of it. V1 attempted to go around a non-contact vehicle that was making a right turn, but ended up colliding with the left rear side of V2. Since V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, it had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. Even though the weather conditions were poor with heavy rain and a wet roadway, V2 should have exercised caution and ensured that it was safe to make the left turn before proceeding. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection.
