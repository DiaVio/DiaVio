The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted and looked down inside the vehicle, causing him to cross the centerline and lose control of the vehicle. This distraction led to the vehicle rotating and impacting both guardrails before coming to a rest on the eastbound travel lane. The police reported travel speed of 105 kmph also indicates that the driver was likely traveling at an excessive speed, which further contributed to the accident.
