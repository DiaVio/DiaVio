The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is a combination of factors. Firstly, the driver made a decision error by driving too fast for the conditions, given the overcast and rainy weather. This decision error was likely influenced by the driver being in a hurry to get to traffic court, which started 15 minutes after the crash. Additionally, a performance error of poor directional control was coded for Vehicle #1, indicating that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. This could be attributed to the vehicle's tires having a maximum tread depth measurement of only 3 millimeters, which may have reduced traction on the wet road surface. Furthermore, the driver's use of six different medications, including one for depression, could have potentially impaired their ability to drive safely. It is important to note that the construction work zone, although coded as a traffic interruption factor, is not known to have directly contributed to the crash.
