The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was involved in an aggressive driving behavior by honking her horn, shaking her fist, and engaging in a confrontation with the driver of the Noncontact Vehicle (NC). - V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not look far enough ahead, leading to a lack of awareness of the stopped vehicle (V2) in lane 3. - Instead of stopping or maneuvering safely, V1 continued traveling in lane 3 (which was a left turn only lane) to exchange gestures with the driver of the NC vehicle. - As a result, V1 lost control and skidded longitudinally, ultimately colliding with V2. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior, inadequate surveillance, and failure to maneuver safely make them primarily responsible for the accident.
