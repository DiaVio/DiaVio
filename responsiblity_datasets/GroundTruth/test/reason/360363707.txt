The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn through stopped vehicles from the center turn only lane, and entered the travel lane of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2006 Toyota Tundra large pickup. As a result, V2 impacted the right side of V1, causing the deployment of airbags and resulting in serious injuries to the front right passenger of V1.
