The driver of Vehicle 1 was traveling at night on a multi-lane divided interstate highway and encountered a slower-moving vehicle ahead. In an attempt to avoid a collision with the slower vehicle, the driver steered left, causing Vehicle 1 to veer into the northbound inboard travel lane and eventually into the center median area. This series of actions led to the subsequent impacts with trees and the resulting damage to Vehicle 1. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 1 for failing to maintain control of the vehicle and causing it to leave its designated lane, resulting in the subsequent collisions.
