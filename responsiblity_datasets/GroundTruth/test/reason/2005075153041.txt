The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 71-year-old female, failed to adjust the directional control of the vehicle as it exited the curve. This resulted in V1 running off the right side of the road and striking a tree. The driver's fatigue from the irregular sleep pattern and physical activities during her overseas trip likely contributed to her poor directional control, as she was not able to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
