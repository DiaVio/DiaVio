The driver of V1 was distracted by a conversation with another driver in the adjacent lane and failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red and that the vehicle in front of her had stopped. This distraction, combined with her unfamiliarity with the roadway and the rush hour congestion, led to her failure to use due care and resulted in the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2).
