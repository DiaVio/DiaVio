The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not see V2 before the crash. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event coded for V1, which states "inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." As a result, V1 was unable to react in time to avoid colliding with V2, who had entered lane two in front of V1 and then stopped to make a u-turn. While V2 is also partially at fault for entering lane two without properly assessing the speed and distance of oncoming traffic, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not exercising proper surveillance and failing to see V2 in time to avoid the collision.
