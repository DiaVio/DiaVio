The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way while attempting to make a left turn. The driver stated that she stopped in the median crossover waiting for traffic to clear, but she did not see Vehicle #2 (the 2001 Ford Focus) approaching until she had already initiated the turn. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of Vehicle #1's driver. Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver was charged with failure to yield and no driver's license, which further supports the conclusion that Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
