The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise across the southbound center turn lane. V1 continued sliding laterally across the southbound lane and west shoulder, ultimately departing the roadway and rolling over onto its roof top. The driver of V1 was the only occupant and sustained serious injuries.
