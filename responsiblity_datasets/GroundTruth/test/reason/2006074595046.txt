The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling straight in the southbound lane. V2 assumed that V1 would stop at the intersection, but when V1 did not stop, V2 attempted to accelerate to avoid a crash. However, this action was not enough to prevent the collision, resulting in V2's right side being struck by the front of V1. Therefore, V2's false assumption of V1's actions and failure to yield the right of way led to the crash.
