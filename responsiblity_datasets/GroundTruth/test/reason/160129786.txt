The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it drifted off the road to the left for unknown reasons, causing it to lose control and subsequently collide with a telephone pole and a tree. The driver of V1 was the sole occupant and was transported to a trauma center for treatment, indicating that the driver's actions or lack of control led to the accident.
