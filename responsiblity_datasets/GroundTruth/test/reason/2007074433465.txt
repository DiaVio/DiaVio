The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the 1998 Dodge Intrepid). V1 stated that she saw V2 but thought the other car was farther away. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to accurately assess the distance and speed of oncoming traffic, leading to the collision. Additionally, V1's inexperience as a driver (only five months of driving experience) and her focus on following her husband's vehicle were associated factors in this crash. These factors likely contributed to her misjudgment of the situation and inability to safely execute the left turn. While V2 was on her cell phone at the time of the crash, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident, as the encroachment by V1 into the opposite lane was the critical event leading to the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed while making a left turn, as well as her inexperience and distraction.
