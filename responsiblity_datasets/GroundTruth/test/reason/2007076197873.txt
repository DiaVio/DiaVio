The driver of V1 was attempting to pass vehicles by crossing over the double-yellow line into the oncoming eastbound lane, which is an illegal maneuver. This aggressive driving behavior ultimately led to the collision with V2 (the 2004 Chevrolet Silverado). The witness statements and the police report confirm that V1 was making multiple attempts to pass vehicles, disregarding the safety of other drivers on the road.
