The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V2, which indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance. - V1 failed to recognize that V2 was in its lane of travel, indicating inadequate surveillance and a failure to look far enough ahead. - V1 was distracted by arguing with his friend on his cell phone while driving, which further contributed to his failure to notice V2. - V1 was fatigued, having been awake for 23 hours with only one hour of sleep, which likely impaired his ability to react and make appropriate decisions. - V1 was in an angry and upset mood due to an argument with his friend, which may have affected his focus and judgment while driving. - V1 was an inexperienced driver, with only two years of driving experience, and was driving on a road he rarely drives, which may have contributed to his lack of familiarity with the roadway and its conditions. - The right, rear tire of V1's vehicle had significantly less tread depth, indicating possible aggressive driving behavior, which could have affected the vehicle's handling and control. In contrast, V2 (the driver of the Mercedes C220) was not primarily responsible for the accident. V2 was traveling at a reasonable speed for the downhill curve and applied her brakes appropriately. She did not see V1 coming prior to the impact, indicating that she was not at fault for the collision. Overall, V1's distracted, fatigued, and aggressive driving behavior, combined with his failure to maintain a safe following distance and inadequate surveillance, make him primarily responsible for the accident.
