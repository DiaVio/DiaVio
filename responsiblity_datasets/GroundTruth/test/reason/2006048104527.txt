The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 112 kmph (70 mph) in a posted speed limit zone of 72 kmph (45 mph), which indicates that the driver was exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation in steering left and then right after the initial road departure suggests a lack of control over the vehicle, further contributing to the crash. Furthermore, the insufficient tread of just 1 to 2 mm (1 to 3/32") on the rear tires of V1 could have compromised the vehicle's traction and stability, making it more susceptible to losing control. Overall, the combination of excessive speed, overcompensation in steering, and inadequate tire tread on V1's rear tires indicates that the driver's actions and vehicle condition were the primary factors leading to the crash.
