The reason for this is that V1, the Audi A6 station wagon, departed the roadway to the right and struck a tree with its right front corner. The driver of V1 admitted to drinking a pint of vodka that morning and has three prior DUI arrests. The presence of alcohol in the driver's system indicates impairment, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the road.
