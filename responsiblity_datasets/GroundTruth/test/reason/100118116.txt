The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to travel off the right side of the roadway, resulting in a collision with a large rock situated at the edge of the trafficway. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, leading to the accident.
