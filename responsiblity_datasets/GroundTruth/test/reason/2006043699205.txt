The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe following distance and did not look far enough ahead, resulting in a collision with the rear of V1. Additionally, V2 was traveling at an estimated speed of 97kmph (60 mph), which was above the posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph) for the roadway. These factors indicate that V2 was not driving at a safe speed for the conditions and did not exercise proper surveillance, leading to the collision.
