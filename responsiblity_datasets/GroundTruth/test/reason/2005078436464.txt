The driver of V1 failed to yield from a stop sign, indicating a violation of traffic rules. They stopped for approximately 30 seconds but then proceeded to accelerate through the intersection without properly judging the gap or the speed of V2. This misjudgment led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed.
