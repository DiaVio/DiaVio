The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by a cell phone conversation with his girlfriend, which caused a recognition error. He failed to recognize that his light was red and did not stop at the traffic control device. Additionally, the driver's emotional state due to the argument further distracted him from the driving task. V2 (the Mitsubishi Outlander) stated that he was intending to go straight through the intersection and that the other vehicle (V1) turned into his vehicle. However, since V1 failed to stop at the red light and made an illegal maneuver, V2's actions were a result of V1's negligence. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving, failure to recognize the red light, and making an illegal maneuver.
