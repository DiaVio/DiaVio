The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed well above the posted speed limit, indicating that they were traveling too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, lack of formal training, and the fact that they overcompensated when they saw the vehicles braking in front of them further contribute to their responsibility for the crash.
