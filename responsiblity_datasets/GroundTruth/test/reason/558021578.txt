The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle on the snow-covered roadway, resulting in fishtailing and ultimately driving off the road and down a steep embankment. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle in adverse weather conditions indicates a lack of caution and appropriate driving skills, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
