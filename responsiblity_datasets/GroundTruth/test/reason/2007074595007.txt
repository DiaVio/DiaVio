The reason for this is that the driver of V1 misjudged the speed of V2 (the 2006 Dodge Sprinter delivery van) and failed to realize that V2 had stopped in front of them. This misjudgment was mainly due to the driver of V1 being engaged in conversation with their passenger, which distracted them from paying attention to the road ahead. As a result, V1 was unable to avoid colliding with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction that led to V2 colliding with V3 (the 1991 Plymouth Voyager). Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their misjudgment of the gap and speed of the vehicles ahead, as well as their distraction from the conversation with their passenger.
