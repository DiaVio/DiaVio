The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. This failure to stop and properly observe the intersection led to V1 crossing into the path of V2 (the 1993 Chevrolet Suburban), resulting in the collision.
