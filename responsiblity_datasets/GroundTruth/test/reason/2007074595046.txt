The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway, entered the right side of the north/south roadway, and struck both the pedestrian and V2. This indicates that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and veered into the path of the pedestrian and V2, causing the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act," indicating that the driver's physical condition, specifically the ruptured spleen and aortic aneurysm, played a role in the loss of control. V2, on the other hand, was stopped southbound, waiting to turn left, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "not involved first harmful event." This suggests that V2 was not directly involved in causing the crash and was not a contributing factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's physical impairment and loss of control of the vehicle.
