The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they had improperly secured cargo, specifically the two mattresses that were strapped to the roof of the vehicle. These mattresses began to come loose and slide backwards, obstructing V2's taillights. This obstruction of taillights made it difficult for V1 to see that V2 had stopped in front of them, leading to the rear-end collision. Additionally, V2 was issued a summons for obstructed taillights, further indicating their responsibility in the accident.
