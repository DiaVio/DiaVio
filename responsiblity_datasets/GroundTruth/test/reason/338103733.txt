The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 steered right to avoid a non-contact vehicle encroaching into the eastbound lane, but subsequently made corrective maneuvers that directed Vehicle 1 towards the left bridge wall. Vehicle 1 then impacted the bridge wall twice, resulting in moderate damage and serious injuries to the driver.
