The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop and collided with the rear of V2 (the 2005 Ford F-250). The driver of V1 was distracted by other police activity in the area and was not paying attention to the fact that V2 had stopped in front of them. This distraction, coupled with the driver's inexperience as a 17-year-old, led to the failure to stop in time and the subsequent collision.
