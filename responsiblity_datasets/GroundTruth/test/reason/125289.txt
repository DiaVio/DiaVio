The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made the decision to reverse down the driveway for a significant distance, which resulted in her losing control and ultimately colliding with a tree. This action of reversing down a winding, wooded driveway goes against safe driving practices and contributed to the accident. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt, which further indicates a lack of responsibility and adherence to safety measures.
