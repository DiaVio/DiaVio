The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others. This is evident from the fact that V1 was unable to avoid the Non-Contact Vehicle (NCV) that cut in front of it, resulting in V1 striking the concrete divider and rolling over. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, further indicating that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle due to excessive speed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others.
