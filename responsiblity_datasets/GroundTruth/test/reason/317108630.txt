The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kph (45 mph), which was below the posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). Additionally, V1 swerved to the right to avoid hitting a deer, but then lost control of the vehicle and departed the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle in a potentially hazardous situation.
