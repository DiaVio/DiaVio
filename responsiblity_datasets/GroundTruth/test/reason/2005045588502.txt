The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which caused her to run off the road and ultimately crash into a sign. The driver's statement to first responders also confirms that she fell asleep, further supporting her responsibility for the accident. Additionally, the driver's drowsy condition, resulting from working consecutive night shifts and having only a 2-hour sleep break, contributed to her falling asleep while driving. The driver's fatigue, combined with the fact that she had a pre-existing back condition and was taking pain medications, likely impaired her ability to stay alert and focused on the road.
