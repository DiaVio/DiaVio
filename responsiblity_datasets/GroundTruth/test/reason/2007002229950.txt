The driver of Vehicle 1 was inattentive, emotionally upset, and possibly experiencing side effects from medication, which could have impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. The driver of Vehicle 1 rear-ended Vehicle 2, causing a chain reaction that resulted in further collisions. The driver of Vehicle 2 was stopped in traffic and had no time to take evasive action. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factors and the initial rear-end collision.
