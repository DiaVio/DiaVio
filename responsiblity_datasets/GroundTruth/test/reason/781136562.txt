The reason for this is that the driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to travel off the northbound roadway, crossing the depressed median, and entering the southbound lanes. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2000 Mitsubishi Montero SUV. Additionally, the driver of V2 observed V1 entering the southbound lanes and began to brake before the collision occurred, indicating a reasonable attempt to avoid the accident. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for their failure to stay in their lane and causing the collision.
