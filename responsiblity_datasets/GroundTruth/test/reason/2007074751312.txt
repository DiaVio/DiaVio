The reason for this is that V2 was the encroaching vehicle, turning into the same direction as V1 from the driveway. V2 failed to adequately surveil the area and did not see V1 prior to the crash. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by personal issues, which likely contributed to her failure to notice V1. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and distracted state of mind make her primarily responsible for the accident.
