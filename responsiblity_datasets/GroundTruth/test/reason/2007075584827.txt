The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was driving too fast for the conditions, specifically on a wet section of the roadway caused by the sprinklers. Additionally, the vehicle had bald tires, which further contributed to the loss of control. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, as indicated by racing with a friend, also played a role in the accident.
