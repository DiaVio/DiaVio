The reason for this is that V2, the gray Buick Regal, was stopped at the tri-light controlled intersection, waiting for the light to turn green. After the light turned green, V1, the white Chevrolet Astro minivan, entered the intersection intending to turn left. However, V2 driver assumed that the other driver (V1) would not enter the intersection on a red light and proceeded into the path of travel of V1 while executing her left turn. This assumption and decision by the V2 driver led to the collision between the front of V1 and the left side of V2.
