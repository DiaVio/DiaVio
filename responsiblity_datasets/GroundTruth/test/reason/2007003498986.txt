The driver of V1 reported that his car went back and forth for some unknown reason and struck V2 twice. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not in control of their vehicle and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2). As a result, V1's actions caused the collision with V2, which then led to V2 colliding with V3. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's unknown error and failure to maintain control of their vehicle.
