The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet conditions of the gravel/slag roadway. Additionally, the driver chose an inappropriate evasive action by overcompensating when the vehicle drifted to the right side of the road. This led to a counter-clockwise yaw and ultimately caused V1 to slide off the road and collide with a stump, resulting in the vehicle flipping onto its roof. The driver's inexperience, as indicated by her age and graduated driver's license, may have also contributed to the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's actions of traveling too fast for the conditions and overcompensating.
