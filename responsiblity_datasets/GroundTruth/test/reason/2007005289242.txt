The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by looking at bicyclists on the side of the road. This external distraction caused V1 to take their eyes off the road and not notice that V2 (the 2004 Hyundai Sonata) was stopped in front of them, waiting to make a left turn. V1's failure to pay attention to the road and the vehicle in front of them led to the collision. Additionally, the associated factor of following too closely was coded to V1, indicating that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. In contrast, V2 was stopped at the intersection, following normal traffic flow, and there were no factors coded to indicate any fault on their part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to distracted driving and following too closely.
