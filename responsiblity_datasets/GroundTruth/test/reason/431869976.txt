The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was attempting to execute a left turn across the northbound lanes of the intersection, which would require yielding to oncoming traffic. However, Vehicle #1 (the 2011 BMW 335is) was traveling in the outboard travel lane of the northbound lanes and had the right of way. Vehicle #2 failed to yield to Vehicle #1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, Vehicle #2 was required to stop at the stop sign controlling the intersection, while Vehicle #1 was traveling on the main road with a posted speed limit of 45 mph. This indicates that Vehicle #2 had a duty to yield to oncoming traffic and failed to do so. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
