The reason for this is that the case occupant lost control of her vehicle on an icy road surface, resulting in the collision with a tree. The impact was severe, causing significant damage to the vehicle. The low calculated delta-v of 46 km/h (29 mph) suggests that the vehicle was not traveling at a high speed, indicating that the loss of control on the icy road was a contributing factor. Additionally, it is mentioned that the case occupant moved to the right in response to the force of the impact, indicating that she was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. The fact that no airbags deployed suggests that the collision was not severe enough to trigger their activation. Furthermore, the case occupant sustained multiple head and brain injuries from head contact with the tree, indicating that she was partially ejected from the vehicle. This suggests that she was not properly restrained or that the impact was severe enough to overcome the effectiveness of the seat belt. Overall, the combination of losing control on an icy road, the severity of the impact, and the resulting injuries to the case occupant point to the primary responsibility lying with the driver of Vehicle 1.
