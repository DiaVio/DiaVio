The driver of V1 was found to be intoxicated with a BAC level of .21, which is more than twice the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle and make appropriate decisions while driving. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as evidenced by the skid marks indicating hard braking. These factors, combined with the lack of evidence supporting the claim of racing vehicles, point to the driver of V1 as the primary cause of the crash.
