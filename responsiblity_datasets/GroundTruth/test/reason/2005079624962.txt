The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 overcompensated while attempting to avoid a collision with a non-contact vehicle that was changing lanes into the same space. This overcompensation caused V1 to lose traction, rotate clockwise, and ultimately leave the roadway, resulting in the collision with the raised curb and subsequent rollover. Therefore, V1's driver's actions of overcompensation and loss of control led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
