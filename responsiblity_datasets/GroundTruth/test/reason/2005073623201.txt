The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being very tired before her route and stated that she didn't wake up until right before she went over the embankment. The witness traveling in front of V1 also observed her appearing slumped over, suggesting that she may have been asleep or passed out while driving. Additionally, the driver mentioned employer-related stress and being told to go despite expressing her fatigue. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's fatigue and potential falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle departing the roadway and ultimately going over the embankment.
