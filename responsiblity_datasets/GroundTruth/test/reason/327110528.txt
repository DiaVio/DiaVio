The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that it departed the road, struck a utility pole, and came to rest facing northwest. This indicates that V1 lost control and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the utility pole. Additionally, the fact that the driver and passenger were not restrained by seat belts suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. It is important to note that the snowy/slushy and freezing rain conditions, as well as the darkness, may have played a role in the accident. However, the primary responsibility is still attributed to V1 due to the loss of control and departure from the road.
