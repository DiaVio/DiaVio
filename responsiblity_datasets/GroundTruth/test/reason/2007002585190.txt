The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the centerline into the eastbound lane and struck V2 (the Harley Davidson motorcycle) in the front. The witness stated that V1 did a "slow drift" into the other lane without any attempt to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that the sun was in his eyes, making it difficult to see at the time of the crash. While the exact cause of the driver's error is unknown (whether it was due to being ill, falling asleep, being inattentive, or having poor directional control), the fact remains that V1 crossed into the opposite lane, resulting in the collision with V2.
