The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, specifically in this case, the driver failed to see the deer until just before impact. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver, which led to the unsuccessful avoidance action and subsequent collision with the gas vent and tree.
