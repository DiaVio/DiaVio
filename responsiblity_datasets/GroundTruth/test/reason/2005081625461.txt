The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making a lane change. The driver looked in his left side rearview mirror to prepare for the lane change but did not properly assess the situation when looking forward again. As a result, V1 collided with the rear of V2 (the 2004 Chevrolet 1500 Suburban) which was already in the lane. V2, on the other hand, changed lanes into lane two and slowed for traffic ahead, which is a normal and expected maneuver. The critical reason for the accident was not coded to V2, indicating that V2 was not at fault.
