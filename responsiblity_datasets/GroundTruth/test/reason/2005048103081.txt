The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver did not have a driver's license and no prior driver training. Additionally, the driver was not familiar with the vehicle and admitted to feeling fatigued at the beginning of the trip. The presence of empty bottles of malt liquor and a half-smoked cigar in the vehicle suggests possible impairment. Furthermore, V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, even though the driver was aware of V2's presence prior to the crash. The critical reason for the accident was coded as an illegal maneuver by V1.
