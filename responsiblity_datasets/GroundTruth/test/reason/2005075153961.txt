The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the left side of travel lane" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to V1 as "driver related factor: misjudgment of gap or other's speed." This indicates that the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes into lane three without properly judging the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from adjacent lane [same direction] - over right lane" and the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment and failure to properly change lanes.
