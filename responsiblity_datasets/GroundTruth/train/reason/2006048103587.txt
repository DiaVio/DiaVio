The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the situation led to V1 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2.
