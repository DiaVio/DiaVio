The reason for this is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the associated factor "traveling too fast for conditions, reason unknown." Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as "driver related factor - overcompensation." This suggests that the driver may have overcorrected when the vehicle initially departed the roadway, leading to the subsequent series of collisions with shrubs, hedges, a landscape timber, and a wooden post. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver has never received any kind of driver training, which could have contributed to their lack of understanding of how to safely negotiate the curve and respond to unexpected situations on the road. Overall, the driver's excessive speed, overcompensation, and lack of driver training make them primarily responsible for the crash.
