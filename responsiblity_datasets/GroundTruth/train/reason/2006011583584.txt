The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Reason for the Critical Event being a decision error of traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. Additionally, the congested traffic restriction was coded as an associated factor, suggesting that V1 did not adjust their speed appropriately for the traffic conditions. By traveling at a speed of 64-80kmph (41-50 mph) in a congested area where the traffic in the right lane was much slower (16-24kmph or 10-15 mph), V1 did not leave enough room to react and avoid the non-contact vehicle that suddenly changed lanes. This resulted in V1 losing control, exiting the roadway, and ultimately colliding with the center guardrail. Therefore, V1's decision to travel too fast for the conditions and failure to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
