The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 began skidding for unknown reasons, indicating a loss of control. - V1 traveled partially off the roadway to the right and then returned to the roadway, suggesting a failure to maintain proper lane position. - V1 began a counter-clockwise rotation and moved partially into the oncoming lane of traffic, indicating a failure to maintain control and stay within the appropriate lane. - V1 rolled over to the right and slid on its side, further indicating a loss of control and failure to maintain proper vehicle stability. - V1 struck a small upward embankment, causing it to roll multiple times, suggesting a failure to avoid obstacles and hazards on the roadway. - The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be significantly higher than the posted speed limit, indicating excessive speed. - The driver of V1 tested positive for alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, indicating impaired driving. Overall, V1's actions, including loss of control, failure to maintain lane position, excessive speed, and impaired driving, contribute to its primary responsibility for the crash.
