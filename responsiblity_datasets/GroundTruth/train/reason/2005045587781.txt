The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he came to a stop at the intersection and looked left then right before making the turn, but he failed to see Vehicle #2 (the Honda Civic) approaching from the northbound direction on the arterial road. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of Vehicle #1. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 mentioned an emotional factor, having spent most of the day with his ailing mother at the hospital. While he stated that this emotional factor did not influence the crash, it is important to note that emotional states can affect a driver's attention and decision-making abilities, potentially contributing to the recognition error in this case. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure to yield and the recognition error associated with inadequate surveillance.
