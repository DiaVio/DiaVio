The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn, which resulted in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 stated that she had a "solid green" light and had the right to make the left turn, but the investigation determined that the driver's inadequate surveillance was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for failure to yield the right of way. V2, on the other hand, was approaching the intersection when the light turned yellow. The driver of V2 stated that she was unable to stop in time and that V1 turned in front of her. While V2 may have been unable to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to yield the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn.
