The reason for this is as follows: - V1 lost control and began to rotate clockwise, ultimately departing the roadway and impacting various objects before flipping and rolling multiple times. - The vehicle was found to have under-inflated tires, with the left front tire having only 14 pounds of pressure. This may have contributed to the initial control loss, especially considering that the vehicle had just come out of a curve to the right. - The driver of V1 was found to be under the influence of illegal drugs (crack cocaine, Methamphetamine, and Marijuana), which likely impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver also had financial problems and concerns with employment, which may have added to her distraction or stress levels while driving. - It is unclear who was actually driving the vehicle, but the driver's statement suggests that there may have been personal conflicts and tensions among the occupants, which could have further distracted or affected the driver's ability to control the vehicle. Overall, the combination of poor vehicle maintenance (under-inflated tires), drug impairment, and potential distractions or conflicts among the occupants indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
