The reason for this is that V2 crossed into the northbound lane, causing the collision with V1. V1's driver attempted to stop prior to the impact, indicating that V1 was following the rules of the road and maintaining their lane. V2's action of crossing into the oncoming lane is a violation of traffic laws and is the primary cause of the accident.
