The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to obey the stop sign controlling the movement through the intersection. She admitted to not seeing the stop sign and not stopping before entering the intersection. Additionally, she mentioned being distracted by adjusting the radio and daydreaming, indicating a lack of attention to the road. These factors, combined with her statement of not being the best driver, suggest that her internal distractions and failure to obey traffic control devices contributed to the collision.
