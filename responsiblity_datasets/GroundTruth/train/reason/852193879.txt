The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver swerved left and lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason. This action caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, cross over lanes, and depart the roadway into the median. The driver's loss of control ultimately led to the rollover and subsequent collision with sage brush and the ground.
