The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop behind V2, which was slowing down and preparing to make a left turn. V1 rear-ended V2, causing the force of impact to push V2 forward and resulting in damage to both vehicles. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see any brake lights and did not realize that the vehicle ahead had stopped. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1, leading to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking with her passengers at the time of the crash, which further contributed to the critical event.
