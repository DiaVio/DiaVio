The reason for V1's responsibility is that the left rear tire's tread partially separated, causing V1 to lose control and veer towards the center divider. The collision occurred when the front and left planes of V1 made contact with the center divider. This indicates that the tire failure was a vehicle-related factor that led to the loss of control and subsequent collision.
