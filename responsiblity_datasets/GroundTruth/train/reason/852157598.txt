The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve to the left. V1 began to go into a counterclockwise yaw, crossed over into another lane, and ultimately departed the roadway. V1 then slid sideways, impacting rocks and a signpost before tripping into a rollover. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
