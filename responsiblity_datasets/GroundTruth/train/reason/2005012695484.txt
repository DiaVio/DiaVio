The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the actions of the through traffic. The driver stated that he thought the eastbound vehicle had a red light and started his left turn, assuming it was safe to do so. However, the driver's assumption was incorrect, and he failed to properly assess the situation before making the turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with his occupants, which affected his attentiveness to the road. This distraction, combined with the driver's fatigue from long work hours and lack of time off, likely contributed to his decision error. It is important to note that the county road commission had changed the timing of the traffic signal after the crash occurred. However, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility for the crash, as the driver's false assumption and distraction were the primary factors leading to the collision.
