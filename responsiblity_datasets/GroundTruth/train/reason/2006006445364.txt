The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the area before changing lanes. The driver admitted to not using his turn signal and not properly checking his side-view mirrors before making the lane change. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 striking V2 (the Chevrolet Geo Prism) and forcing it partially off the roadway. Additionally, the witness testimonies support V2's lack of fault in the accident. Witness #1 stated that he did not even see V2 because V1 was blocking his view, and Witness #2 confirmed that V2 had no opportunity to avoid being struck by V1. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of fault and the witness testimonies, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
