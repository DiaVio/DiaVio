The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which is a critical pre-crash event attributed to V1. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically external distraction. V1's decision to steer left into the oncoming lane to avoid the dog, without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulted in the collision with V2. This action violated traffic rules and contributed to the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Jeep Cherokee) saw the dog and observed V1 swerving, but stopped as a result. V2's actions were appropriate and did not contribute to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their lane violation and external distraction.
