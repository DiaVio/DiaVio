The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was making a left turn from the westbound left turn lane and had almost cleared the intersection when Vehicle #2 struck the towed unit on the right side near the back end. Vehicle #1 should have ensured that it was safe to complete the left turn before proceeding, especially considering the dark and rainy conditions. Additionally, the poorly marked trailer attached to Vehicle #1 may have made it difficult for Vehicle #2 to see and anticipate the turn.
