The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to hydroplaning caused by excess water pooling in lane one. The driver attempted to regain control by steering and braking, but was unsuccessful. The inspection of V1 also revealed that the heavily mudded right front tire was the tripping force that caused the vehicle to flip onto its roof. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle in the poor road conditions caused by the standing water.
