The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Ford Explorer) without yielding the right of way. V1 admitted to looking at oncoming traffic but failed to see V2 approaching, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was in a hurry to make a delivery and may have been distracted by non-driving activities, such as listening to the radio. The presence of a vehicle in front of V1 may have also obstructed their sightline. These factors contribute to V1's inadequate surveillance and driver error, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
