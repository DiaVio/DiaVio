The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe and recognize the oncoming V2 (the 1999 Ford F650 XLT cab behind engine straight truck) before pulling out into the intersection. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking right and left, the driver of V1 did not see V2 until just prior to the impact. This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that V2 may have been blocked from their line of sight by the right B pillar of their vehicle. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure clear visibility before proceeding through an intersection, and failing to do so contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and failure to properly observe the oncoming V2.
