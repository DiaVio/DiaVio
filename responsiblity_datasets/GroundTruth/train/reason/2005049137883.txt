The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection, left the roadway to the left, and struck a traffic light pole. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene, and large amounts of drugs, weapons, and money were found in the vehicle. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was engaged in illegal activities, which may have contributed to the crash.
