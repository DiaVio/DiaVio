The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the occupant of V1 was the driver of the vehicle involved in the severe frontal impact with the concrete bridge/overpass support pillar. The injuries sustained by the occupant, including fractures, hemothoraces, and lacerations, are consistent with the impact and the loading of the seat belt and airbag. The occupant's upper torso loaded the seat belt webbing and the frontal airbag, indicating that the occupant was properly restrained at the time of the crash. The injuries to the chest, clavicle, sternum, spleen, liver, and heart are all likely a result of the impact and the loading forces on the occupant's body. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
