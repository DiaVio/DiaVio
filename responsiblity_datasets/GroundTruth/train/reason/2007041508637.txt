The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was speeding and failed to obey the traffic control device. This is indicated by the associated factors mentioned in the case summary, which state that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (above the posted speed limit) and that there was a failure to obey the traffic control device. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," suggesting that V1 was the vehicle that entered the intersection and made contact with V2. On the other hand, the case summary does not provide enough information to determine the primary responsibility for V2 (the 1996 Toyota Camry). The driver of V2 was not interviewed, and no associated factors could be determined for this driver. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1.
