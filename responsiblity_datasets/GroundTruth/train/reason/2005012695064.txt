The reason for this is that the driver, who was not of driving age and had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, took the keys without permission and drove the vehicle without proper experience or skill. The driver's inexperience, combined with the effects of the medication he was taking and his condition, likely contributed to his poor directional control and inability to navigate the turn properly. Additionally, the driver's decision to drive without proper authorization and supervision further demonstrates his responsibility for the crash.
