The reason for this is that V2 was stopped in the center left turn lane, waiting to make a left turn into a business driveway. V2 then entered V1's lane of travel, causing the front of V1 to impact the right side of V2. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
