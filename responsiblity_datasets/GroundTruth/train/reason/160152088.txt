The reason for this is that V1 encountered a large horse in the roadway and struck it with the front of the vehicle. This indicates that V1 was unable to avoid the collision with the horse, suggesting a lack of attentiveness or appropriate reaction from the driver. Additionally, V1 went off the roadway and struck a fence and three small trees, indicating a loss of control of the vehicle after the initial collision with the horse. The fact that the case occupant was unrestrained further suggests a lack of responsibility in ensuring personal safety while driving.
