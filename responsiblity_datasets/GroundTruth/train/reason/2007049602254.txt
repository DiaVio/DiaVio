The driver of V1 attempted to make a right turn from lane one onto a one-way roadway, but realized she was going the wrong way and tried to steer back into the intersection. This maneuver caused V1 to cross lane one of the eastbound lanes, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 2003 Ford F-150 Pick up). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 veered into the wrong lane. The driver's inadequate surveillance, failing to notice that the cross street was a well-marked, one-way roadway, was also identified as an associated factor in the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's incorrect turn and failure to observe the traffic signs indicating a one-way road.
