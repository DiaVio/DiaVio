The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking both ways, the driver failed to detect V2 approaching from the right. This failure to properly observe the intersection and detect the oncoming vehicle led to the collision.
