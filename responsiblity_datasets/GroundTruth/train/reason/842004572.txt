The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling westbound on a two-lane rural roadway and crossed the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2001 Nissan Altima GXE 4-door sedan). This indicates that Vehicle 1 was in the wrong lane and caused the collision by entering the eastbound travel lane.
