The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the southbound traffic before initiating the left turn. The driver assumed that the southbound traffic would stop when the traffic light turned yellow, without actually looking to confirm this. This lack of proper surveillance and assumption of right-of-way led to the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 2005 Honda Civic) also had a critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment," it is important to note that V2's critical reason for the event was not coded to their vehicle. This suggests that V2 did not have any contributing factors that directly led to the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and make sure it was safe to turn left makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
