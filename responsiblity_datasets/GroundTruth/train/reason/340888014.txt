The reason for this is that the case vehicle, the 2015 Kia Forte, was traveling in the outside westbound lane and was in the process of turning left through the intersection. V2, being eastbound on the same traffic-way, should have yielded the right of way to the case vehicle. However, V2 failed to do so and collided with the right-rear door and quarter panel of the case vehicle. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to avoid the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
