The reason for V1's responsibility is that it made contact with the rear of V2 (the Dodge Caravan) while V2 was stopped in eastbound lane two, waiting to initiate a left turn into the driveway. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision.
