The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted into the northbound travel lane while negotiating the right turning curve, causing the collision with Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 (2007 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan) took evasive action by steering right into the east paved shoulder area and braking, but was still struck by the frontal plane of Vehicle 2.
