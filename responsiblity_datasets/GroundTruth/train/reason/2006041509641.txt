The reason for this is that V1 ran into the back of V2, which then pushed V2 into the back of V3. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, resulting in a chain reaction collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to have made insufficient braking inputs, suggesting a lack of attention or awareness of the situation ahead.
