The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, as it was their first time on the road and they had only been driving for 12 months. The driver and passenger were also engaged in a social conversation, indicating a potential distraction from focusing on the road.
