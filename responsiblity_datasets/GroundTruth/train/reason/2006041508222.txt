The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and collided with the back of V2 (the 1993 Dodge Stealth). This indicates a recognition error on the part of the V1 driver, who may have been distracted or unfamiliar with the area. The fact that V1 was traveling at a speed of 32 kmph, the same as V2, suggests that V1 did not slow down or react appropriately to the stopped vehicle ahead. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and the resulting collision make them primarily responsible for the accident.
