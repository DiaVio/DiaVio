The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to pass through the intersection after stopping at the stop sign, but failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. The driver of V1 stated that the sun was in her eyes, which may have contributed to her failure to see the oncoming vehicle. However, this does not absolve her of responsibility as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure safe passage through an intersection, regardless of external factors. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that the driver of V1 was talking on a cell phone, which further suggests that V1 was not fully focused on the road and may have been distracted. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and potential distraction.
