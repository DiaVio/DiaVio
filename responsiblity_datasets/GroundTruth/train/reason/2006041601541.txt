The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision to change lanes and accelerate around the stopped vehicles in order to avoid stopping. However, as she drove through some radiator fluid that had leaked out on the roadway, she lost control of her vehicle and departed off the right side of the roadway, making contact with the right-hand side guardrail. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of her vehicle and adjust her driving behavior to the road conditions, ultimately leading to the crash.
