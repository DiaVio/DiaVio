The reason for this is that V1 lost control due to the foggy conditions and snow/ice on the roadway. It crossed over into the northbound lane and departed the roadway, ultimately impacting the embankment and rolling over multiple times. The driver of V1, the case occupant, was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal airbag deployed, indicating that safety measures were in place. However, the loss of control and subsequent rollover were a result of the driver's inability to navigate the hazardous road conditions, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
