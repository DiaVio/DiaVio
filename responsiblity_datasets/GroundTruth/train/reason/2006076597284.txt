The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being inattentive and possibly following too closely. Additionally, the driver did not have enough gap distance to respond to the braking action of V2 (the Dodge Ram 2500) even if they were traveling at the speed limit. This indicates a lack of proper following distance and attentiveness on the part of V1.
