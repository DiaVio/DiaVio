The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle two was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, specifically in this case, the deceleration of vehicle one. The driver of vehicle two stated that he was uncomfortable with the speed, volume, and general traffic flow in the area, which indicates that he may not have been driving with the necessary caution and awareness required for the conditions. Additionally, the fact that vehicle two was unable to avoid the collision despite noticing vehicle one slowing down suggests that the driver was not able to react in time due to his speed and the load he was carrying. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident.
