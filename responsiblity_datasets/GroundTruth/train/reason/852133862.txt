The reason for this is that V1 completely departed the roadway, crossed over both lanes of travel, and ultimately ended up in a rollover situation. The driver of V1 was not restrained, which likely contributed to the serious injuries sustained. Additionally, V1 was the only vehicle involved in the crash, indicating that the driver of V1 was solely responsible for the incident.
