The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a clear sightline obstructed by a large transit bus turning right at the northeast corner of the intersection. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure a safe passage through the intersection, even if their view is obstructed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
