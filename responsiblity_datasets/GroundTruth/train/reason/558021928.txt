The reason for this is that the case vehicle was traveling on a snow-covered roadway and began to fishtail, indicating a loss of control. The driver was unable to regain control, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree. The fact that the vehicle fishtailed suggests that the driver may have been driving too fast for the road conditions or not adjusting their driving behavior to account for the snowy conditions.
