The driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and did not realize that the traffic ahead had stopped. This lack of awareness and failure to respond to unexpected actions led to the collision with the back of V2 (the GMC Envoy). Additionally, the driver of V1 was not wearing her glasses, which may have impaired her vision and ability to react in time.
