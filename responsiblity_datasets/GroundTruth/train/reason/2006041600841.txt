The driver of V1, who only had a learner's permit, failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and entered the intersection without stopping. This action caused V1 to collide with V2 (the 2000 Ford Van) that was already traveling in lane 2 of the eastbound roadway. Although V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, the impact still occurred. As a result of the collision, V2 veered to the left and subsequently collided with V3 (the 1992 Toyota Corolla) in the left rear. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and disregard for the stop sign makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
