Reason: V1 was following V2 too closely and was unable to respond to V2's deceleration. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, V1 admitted to being late for work and was possibly in a hurry, which could have contributed to his failure to maintain a safe following distance. V1's lack of attention and failure to anticipate the actions of the vehicle in front make him primarily responsible for the accident.
