The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1, a 62-year-old male, was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. This means that he was not properly secured with a seatbelt, which is a violation of traffic safety regulations. As a result, when the crash occurred and V1 impacted a tree, the unrestrained driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and protect the occupants. Additionally, the fact that the right rear occupant, a 96-year-old female, sustained severe injuries indicates that the lack of restraint usage by the driver contributed to the severity of the crash. The occupant's movement within the vehicle and subsequent contact with various surfaces resulted in significant injuries, including a hyperflexion fracture to the cervical vertebrae and associated spinal cord injury, as well as contusions to the head and brain. Therefore, the failure of the driver of V1 to use the available manual restraint and ensure the safety of the occupants makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
