The reason for this is that the driver is responsible for ensuring the safety of all passengers in the vehicle, including properly securing them with seat belts. In this case, the front row right passenger was not properly secured due to having the seatback fully reclined at the time of impact. This resulted in the upper body not being in contact with the shoulder belt portion, leading to severe injuries when the occupant moved forward in response to the impact. Additionally, the driver is responsible for driving in a safe manner and avoiding collisions. The severe frontal impact collision with a large tree suggests that the driver failed to exercise proper caution and control of the vehicle, leading to the accident. Therefore, the driver of the 2006 Scion TC (V1) is primarily responsible for the accident.
