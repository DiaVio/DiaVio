The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap and speed of V2 (the 2005 Mercury Monterey minivan) and failed to stop in time to avoid a collision. V1 was following closely behind V2 and did not have enough room to stop when V2 came to a complete stop. This indicates a driver-related decision error on the part of V1. Additionally, there are two associated factors that contribute to V1's responsibility. The first factor is fatigue, as the driver of V1 stated that she is always tired due to working a full-time job and attending school full-time. Fatigue can impair judgment and reaction time, increasing the likelihood of a collision. The second factor is a potential vehicle condition issue, as the driver expressed concerns about a braking system deficiency. Although this could not be confirmed during the vehicle inspection, it suggests that the condition may have been present and could have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to a misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2, as well as potential fatigue and vehicle condition issues.
