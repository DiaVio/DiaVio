The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a right-hand turn at the T-intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver stated that he looked both ways but did not see V2 (the 2003 Pontiac Grand Am) approaching. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision between the front of V2 and the left side of V1. V2, on the other hand, was traveling straight and took appropriate avoidance actions, indicating that she was not thought to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
