The reason for this is that V1 failed to bring the vehicle to a stop in time, resulting in the right front corner of V1 impacting the rear of V2 (the 2005 Honda Accord). This initial impact caused a chain reaction, with V2 rotating clockwise and impacting the rear of V3 (the 2000 BMW 323), and V3 being pushed forward and under riding the vehicle in front of it. While the exact reason for V1's failure to stop in time is not provided, it is stated that the driver of V1 refused to provide any information that would indicate why they applied their brakes too late. This lack of cooperation and refusal to provide further information suggests that the driver of V1 may have been at fault for not maintaining a safe following distance or not paying attention to the traffic ahead.
