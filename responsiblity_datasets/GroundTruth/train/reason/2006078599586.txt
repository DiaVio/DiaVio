The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, as they had passed another vehicle just prior to the crash while eluding US Border Patrol agents. These actions demonstrate a disregard for the safety of others on the road and contribute to the responsibility of V1 for the accident.
