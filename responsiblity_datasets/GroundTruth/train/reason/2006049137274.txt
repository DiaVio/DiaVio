The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to make a right turn at the intersection. This misjudgment led to the front of V1 impacting the right side of V2. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic are the main factors that caused the accident.
