The witness stated that V2 (the driver of the 1995 Honda Civic) had a green light and was slowing down to make a left turn. The witness also saw V1 run the red light and strike V2. This indicates that V1 failed to obey/observe the traffic control prior to entering the intersection on a red light. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment-from crossing street, turning into opposite direction," with an associated factor of inadequate surveillance and disregard for the traffic controls. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 until impact, further supporting the conclusion that V1 failed to properly observe the intersection and the presence of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light and failing to properly observe the traffic control and the presence of V2.
