The reason for this is that V1 was stopped in a through-traffic lane, waiting to turn left, instead of being in the designated left turn lane. This action obstructed the view of opposing traffic for V2 (the driver of the 2005 Toyota Matrix), who was approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see the approaching V2. Therefore, V1's driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision.
