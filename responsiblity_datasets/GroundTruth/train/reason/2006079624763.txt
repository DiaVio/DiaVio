The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and taking her attention away from the road to put out her cigarette. This internal distraction caused her to lose control of the vehicle and veer off the road, ultimately colliding with the concrete barrier. The driver's admission of distraction and refusal to answer further questions further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
