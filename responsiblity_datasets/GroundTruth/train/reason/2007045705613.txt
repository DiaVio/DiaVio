The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the child in the vehicle, causing her to turn around and take her attention away from the road. This distraction led to poor directional control, resulting in V1 veering off the road and ultimately colliding with the fire hydrant. Additionally, the driver admitted to being in a hurry, which may have contributed to her lack of focus on the road.
