The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. - The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown," suggesting that the driver made an error that led to the vehicle leaving the road. - The fact that V1 struck a culvert, rotated, and then struck a mailbox post before rolling over multiple times indicates a loss of control and potentially reckless driving behavior. - The driver's ingestion of Amphetamines, Benzodiazepines, Methadone, and Marijuana, as indicated by the medical records, raises concerns about impaired driving and the potential influence of these substances on the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. Overall, the combination of the driver's error, the loss of control, and the presence of multiple substances in the driver's system suggests that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
