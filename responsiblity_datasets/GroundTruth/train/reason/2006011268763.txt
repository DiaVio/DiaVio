The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the poor road conditions. Despite knowing the location of the holes in the road, the driver was unable to negotiate around them and lost control of the vehicle. This indicates a failure to adjust speed and driving behavior to match the road conditions, ultimately leading to the crash.
