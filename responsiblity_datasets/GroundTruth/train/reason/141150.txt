The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver and right-front passenger of V1 were both reaching to the floor to retrieve an object that fell, causing the vehicle to depart the right roadside and ultimately collide with a tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 was distracted and not fully focused on the road, leading to the accident.
