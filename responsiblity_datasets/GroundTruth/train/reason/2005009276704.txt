The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road and misjudged the velocity of the vehicle in front of him. This recognition error led to V1 changing lanes to pass the stopped vehicle without noticing that V2 was also stopped in lane two at the intersection. The driver's lack of experience on this road and the misjudgment of the other vehicle's velocity further contributed to the crash.
