The driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including speeding, tailgating, and making frequent lane changes. This behavior indicates a lack of caution and disregard for the safety of others on the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption that V2 (the 1993 Mercedes Benz SL600) would continue to proceed, which further demonstrates a failure to exercise proper judgment and awareness. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 is unlicensed, which suggests a lack of knowledge and experience in operating a vehicle legally and safely. Overall, the combination of aggressive driving behavior, false assumptions, and the driver's poor health condition contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the collision.
