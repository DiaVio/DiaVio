The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to take correct evasive action when the elk entered the roadway. Instead of safely maneuvering around the elk, the driver applied the brakes and swerved to the left, causing the vehicle to collide with the elk and subsequently run off the road. This incorrect evasive action ultimately led to the collision and subsequent damage to V1.
