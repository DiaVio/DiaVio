The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 1996 Dodge Ram Truck) when crossing the intersection. V1's driver stated that she looked both ways before proceeding into the roadway, but she failed to see V2 approaching from the left. Additionally, V1's driver was preoccupied with checking the takeout in her vehicle, which became an internal distraction. Instead of stopping or yielding, she accelerated, causing the collision with V2.
