The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted to negotiate a right-hand curve but crossed over the center lane line, causing V1 to lose control and collide with V2 (the 2008 Jeep Wrangler) in the southbound lane. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle and crossed into oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
