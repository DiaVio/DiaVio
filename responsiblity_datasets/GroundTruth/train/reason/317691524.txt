The driver of V1 drifted out of the travel lane onto the right shoulder, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's overcorrection and subsequent loss of control further contributed to the accident. The driver's steering maneuvers caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and ultimately veer off the roadway, resulting in the collision with the private drives and the serious injuries sustained by the driver.
