The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling westbound on a two-lane rural roadway and departed the road, resulting in a series of subsequent impacts with various objects, including guide wires, a garage, landscaping, and the front brick fa√ßade of a residence. The driver of Vehicle 1 was also found to be unrestrained, indicating a lack of proper safety precautions.
