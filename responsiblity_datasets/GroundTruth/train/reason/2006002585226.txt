The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle due to a jackknife event (trailer swing) and overcompensation. The driver attempted to correct the sway by steering right and then left, but overcorrected back to the right, resulting in the vehicle crossing into the passing lane and ultimately crashing into the guardrail and rolling over. The driver's overcompensation and inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Additionally, the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the trailer, despite driving the combination for 2 years, suggests a lack of proper handling and control of the vehicle. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's errors and failure to maintain control of the vehicle and trailer.
