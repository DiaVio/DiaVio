The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed (113 kph or 70 mph) on a wet road during rain, which caused it to hydroplane and lose control. Additionally, V1 crossed multiple lanes and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a sign support pole in the center of the median. The driver of V1 was also not wearing a seatbelt, which may have contributed to the severity of their injuries.
