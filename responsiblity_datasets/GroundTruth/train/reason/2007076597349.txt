The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a blowout/flat tire, specifically the right rear tire tread separation. This tire failure caused V1 to steer left across the #2 lane, and the driver's reaction of steering right to counter the vehicle pull resulted in the trailer whipping clockwise. This sequence of events ultimately led to V1 rotating clockwise and rolling off the roadway into the center median. While the driver stated that the event happened too fast for him to control the vehicle, the primary cause of the accident was the tire failure, which is considered a vehicle-related factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
