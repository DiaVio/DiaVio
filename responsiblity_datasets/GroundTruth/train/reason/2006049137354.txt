The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost consciousness and departed the roadway on the right side, ultimately colliding with a concrete wall. The driver's loss of consciousness was attributed to a driver-related factor, specifically a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. This impairment caused the driver to pass out prior to the impact, resulting in the crash.
