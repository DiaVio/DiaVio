The reason for V1's responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as an illegal maneuver, specifically failing to stop for a traffic control device. This indicates that V1 ran a red light, which resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, there is no mention of any factors indicating inadequate surveillance or failure to look on the part of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and stop for the red light makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
