The driver of V1 admitted to taking her eyes off the road to look for a street sign, which resulted in her failing to notice that V2 (the Nissan Pathfinder) was stopped in front of her. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, factors such as the wet condition of the roadway, the rain, and the driver's unfamiliarity with the road and where she was supposed to turn may have contributed to her inability to react in time to avoid the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that she never saw V1 coming and was unable to take any avoidance actions. While V2 may have been stopped at the red light, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not maintaining proper attention and rear-ending V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
