The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. They relied on another driver's actions and did not check for themselves, assuming the way was clear. Additionally, V1 turned with an obstructed view, as they stated they couldn't see around the traffic in the right northbound lane. The researcher also observed that V1 was conversing with her passenger, which may have distracted her from properly assessing the situation. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Toyota 4-Runner) was not primarily responsible for the accident. While V2 was involved in the collision, the critical precrash event for V2 was another vehicle encroaching from a driveway turning into the opposite direction. The police report did not code any critical reason to V2, and the only contributing factor was the driver's inexperience, being only eighteen years old. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to inadequate surveillance, turning with an obstructed view, and potentially being distracted by conversation with her passenger.
