The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by adjusting the radio, which caused him to look away from the road. When he looked back up, he saw brake lights on the vehicle in front of him and had to take evasive action to avoid a collision. However, the driver's incorrect evasive action of swerving left and then back into lane one resulted in a collision with V2 (the 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada). This indicates that V1's driver failed to maintain proper control of his vehicle and did not react appropriately to the traffic situation. Additionally, factors such as overcompensation, driver inexperience, and the traffic flow interruption caused by the police vehicle on the shoulder contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that V2's driver also had factors associated with the accident, such as the weight of the cargo, trailer, and motorcycle, as well as unfamiliarity with the roadway. However, based on the information provided, V1's driver's actions and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the primary factors leading to the accident.
