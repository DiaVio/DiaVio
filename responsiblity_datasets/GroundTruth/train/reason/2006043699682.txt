The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) in a posted speed limit zone of 72 kmph (45 mph), which indicates that he was driving too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver was not familiar with the road and had borrowed the vehicle from a friend, which may have contributed to his lack of control on the curve. The presence of scattered gravel on the roadway due to nearby construction also added to the hazardous conditions. The driver's claim of wet road conditions was not supported by evidence from the investigating officer or the researcher. Furthermore, the low tread on the front tires of V1 could have further compromised the vehicle's ability to maintain control. Overall, the driver's excessive speed, lack of familiarity with the road, and poor vehicle maintenance make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
