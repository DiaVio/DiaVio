The driver of V1 stated that he could not remember anything prior to the crash and mentioned that he had not been able to sleep for three days, potentially indicating a state of extreme fatigue. Additionally, the passenger reported that the vehicle began to speed up very fast and the driver was stretched straight out with the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor, suggesting a loss of control due to a physical impairment or medical condition, possibly a seizure or a heart attack. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's physical impairment and potential fatigue, which led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the posts, canal embankment, and trees.
