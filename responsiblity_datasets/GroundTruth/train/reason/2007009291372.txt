The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was driving erratically, zigzagging between lanes and not maintaining a consistent direction of travel. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in non-driving activities, such as rubbing her eyes and searching for a falling object, which indicates a lack of attention to the road. The driver's physical condition, including blurred vision and swollen ankles, may have also contributed to her inability to control the vehicle properly. Furthermore, the driver of V1 did not see V2 (the 2007 Toyota Corolla) directly in her line of sight, indicating a failure to observe and react to other vehicles on the road. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) did make an error by remaining in the intersection while waiting for westbound traffic to clear before completing a left turn. However, this error alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility, as V1's erratic driving and lack of attention were significant contributing factors to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to erratic driving, lack of attention, and failure to observe other vehicles on the road.
