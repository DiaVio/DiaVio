The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the speed of V2 and turning left in front of V2 at the intersection. This misjudgment led to the collision between V1 and V2, as well as subsequent collisions with V3 and V4. The driver of V1 also had a BAC test result of 0.082, indicating the presence of alcohol in their system, which may have impaired their judgment and contributed to the crash.
