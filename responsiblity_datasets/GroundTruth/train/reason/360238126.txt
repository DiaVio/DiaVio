The reason for this is that V1 lost control while negotiating a curve, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw and departure from the roadway. V1 then collided with multiple fence posts and a telephone pole, causing significant damage. The driver of V1 sustained minor injuries, indicating that they were likely in control of the vehicle at the time of the crash.
