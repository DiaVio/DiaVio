The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the right and impacted the back of Vehicle 2 (V2), which was legally parked and unoccupied in the east parking lane. This initial impact caused V2 to be pushed into the roadway and come to rest in the west parking lane. After the initial impact, V1 continued north and then impacted the back of Vehicle 3 (V3), which was also legally parked and unoccupied in the east parking lane. Both V1 and V3 then came to rest in the parking lane, still in contact. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident as it was the vehicle that initiated the chain of events by departing its lane and causing the subsequent impacts with V2 and V3.
