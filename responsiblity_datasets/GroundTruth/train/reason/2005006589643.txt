The reason for this is that V1 crossed over from lane two to lane one and made contact with the cement guardrail on the right side of lane one. There is no evidence of a phantom vehicle or contact with another vehicle, contradicting the driver's claim of being cut off. The driver's statement also changed regarding his destination, initially stating he was going to a location near the off ramp but later saying he was on his way home. The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating poor directional control. The Critical Reason was coded as poor directional control, a performance error. Factors associated with the driver included talking on a cell phone (internal distraction) and overcompensation (driver performance error). Therefore, based on the evidence and driver behavior, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
