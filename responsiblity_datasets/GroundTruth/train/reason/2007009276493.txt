The driver of V1 failed to slow down in time when traffic slowed down due to a red traffic signal. This indicates driver inattention and a failure to respond to the unexpected actions of others. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption that the other vehicles would continue to proceed, which further contributed to the accident. Following too closely and traffic congestion were also associated factors. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention, failure to respond to traffic conditions, and false assumptions.
