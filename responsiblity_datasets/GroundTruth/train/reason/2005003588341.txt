The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that his sightline was restricted by an oncoming vehicle, but it was determined that he did not properly look and see the oncoming Vehicle #1. This inadequate surveillance and decision error led to the collision between Vehicle #1 and Vehicle #2.
