The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including racing with another vehicle and making fast and frequent lane changes. This behavior indicates a disregard for the safety of others on the road and increases the risk of accidents. Additionally, V1 admitted to changing lanes and hitting the brakes when the pickup truck in front of him slowed down, which ultimately led to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the Ford F-250) was traveling at the posted speed limit and was not engaged in any aggressive driving behavior. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the adjacent lane, indicating that V1 crossed over the left lane line and collided with V2. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their aggressive driving behavior and failure to maintain control of their vehicle.
