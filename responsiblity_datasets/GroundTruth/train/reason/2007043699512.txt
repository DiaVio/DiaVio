The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a higher speed than V1 and failed to slow down for the vehicle in front of them. This is indicated by the Critical Precrash Event for V2, which states that there was another motor vehicle in the same lane traveling at a lower steady speed. The Critical Reason for V2 was identified as "too fast for conditions," indicating that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too high for the circumstances, such as the dark and dry conditions on the uphill grade of the highway. Additionally, V2's impact with the rear of V1 and subsequent collision with the guardrail suggests that the driver was not able to maintain control of their vehicle while traveling at such a high speed. The fact that the driver fled the scene further indicates their negligence and lack of responsibility. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed and failure to slow down for the vehicle in front of them.
