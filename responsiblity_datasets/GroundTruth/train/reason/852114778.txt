The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound on a two-lane, two-way street with no traffic controls, while V1 had stopped for a stop sign at the intersection. V1 started to cross straight through the intersection, which is a legal maneuver, while V2 attempted to swerve left to avoid the collision. However, V2 was unable to stop in time and ended up impacting the right side of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and inability to avoid the collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
