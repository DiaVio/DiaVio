The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which was not allowed according to the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event. V1 failed to see V2 (the 2001 Ford Ranger) approaching from the opposite direction and crossed into its pathway, resulting in a collision. Additionally, V1 struck a utility pole after colliding with V2, indicating a lack of control and awareness of the surroundings. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
