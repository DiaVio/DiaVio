The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of oncoming traffic, which is a risky maneuver. V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and did not see V2 approaching in the adjacent lane. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision. While V2 did attempt to swerve and avoid V1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe left turn without properly assessing the oncoming traffic.
