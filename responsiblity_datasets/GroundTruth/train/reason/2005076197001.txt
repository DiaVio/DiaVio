The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before entering, as indicated by the critical reason coded as "inadequate surveillance." This means that the driver did not properly observe the oncoming traffic and failed to notice V2 (the 2002 Ford F-650 flatbed wrecker) approaching in the right lane. Additionally, V1 was exiting the shopping mall and stopped at the stop sign, indicating that it had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 should have ensured that it was safe to proceed before entering the roadway. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from a crossing street across the path. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident, as it was traveling in the right lane and had the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
