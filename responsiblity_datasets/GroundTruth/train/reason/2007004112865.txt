The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the International school bus). This is evident from the witness report stating that V1 did not stop for the stop sign and the critical pre-crash event coded as "This vehicle traveling-crossing over (passing through) intersection" with the critical reason being "Inadequate surveillance". Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2.
