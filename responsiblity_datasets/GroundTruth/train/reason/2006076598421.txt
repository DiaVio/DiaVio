The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at the same speed as V2, but failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of V2. The driver of V1 stated that they could not see too far ahead due to sun glare, which indicates a lack of attention and failure to adjust driving behavior to the prevailing conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been driving for less than half an hour, which suggests a lack of experience or familiarity with the road. On the other hand, V2 was stopped and proceeded through the intersection on a green light, indicating that they were following traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and adjust their driving behavior to the prevailing conditions.
