The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop for traffic and rear-ended V2 (the 1991 Nissan Pathfinder). V1 admitted to being distracted just before the crash, as she was holding two cell phones while driving and was talking with her husband on one of them. She looked down to put the device back into the cradle and did not notice that traffic had stopped. This distraction and failure to pay attention to the road led to the collision. Additionally, V1's use of two cell phones while driving indicates a lack of focus and disregard for safe driving practices. The fact that she takes several medications for her heart and stomach, which may have potential side effects, raises concerns about her ability to operate a vehicle safely. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in lane one behind a non-contact vehicle that was making a left turn into a private driveway. V2 was not at fault for the accident as she was following the flow of traffic and was not traveling at a higher speed compared to V1. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her distraction, failure to stop for traffic, and lack of attention to the road.
