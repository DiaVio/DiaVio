The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high speed of approximately 121 kmph (75 mph), which may have contributed to the loss of control. - V1 attempted to pass another vehicle while traveling in the number two lane, indicating a poor decision-making and lack of caution. - V1 departed the left side of the roadway and then overcompensated by steering to the right, resulting in the vehicle rolling over. - The investigating officer did not find any evidence of alcohol or drug impairment, ruling out those factors as causes of the accident. - The condition of the tires, including under-inflation and damage, may have played a role in the accident, but it is unclear if they were the primary cause. Overall, V1's actions, including excessive speed, improper passing, and poor control of the vehicle, indicate that they are primarily responsible for the accident.
