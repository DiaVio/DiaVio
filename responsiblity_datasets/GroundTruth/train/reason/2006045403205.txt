The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 attempted to make a left turn in front of V1, who had the right of way and a green light. V2 claimed to have a green turn arrow, but this contradicts the statement that V1 had a green light. Additionally, V2 stated that he did not see V1 approaching from the opposite direction, indicating inadequate surveillance and failure to look properly before making the turn. The fact that V2 moved his vehicle to a private parking lot after the crash also raises questions about his actions and potential attempts to avoid responsibility. In summary, V2's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
