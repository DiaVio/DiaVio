The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize the presence of the black bull in the roadway. Despite attempting to steer left to avoid the animal, the driver was unable to do so in time, resulting in a collision. The report states that the bull blended in with the black asphalt, making it difficult for the driver to see it in the darkness. However, it is still the responsibility of the driver to be vigilant and aware of potential hazards on the road, especially at high speeds.
