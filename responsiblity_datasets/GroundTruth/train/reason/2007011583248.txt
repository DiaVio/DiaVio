The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver's decision error of driving too fast for the icy conditions. The driver stated that he was traveling at his usual speed, without taking into account the slick surface due to icy conditions. This decision error led to V1 losing control and sliding off the left side of the roadway, ultimately resulting in the collision with the trees. Additionally, the driver's non-driving activity of smoking and driving with one hand at the time of the control loss could have distracted him and inhibited any avoidance attempts. This further contributes to V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It should be noted that V1 was equipped with 4-wheel drive, which could have potentially helped in maintaining control on the icy road. However, it was not in use at the time of the crash, indicating a failure on the part of the driver to utilize available resources to mitigate the risks associated with the road conditions. Overall, V1's primary responsibility for the accident lies in the driver's decision error of driving too fast for the icy conditions and the distractions caused by non-driving activities.
