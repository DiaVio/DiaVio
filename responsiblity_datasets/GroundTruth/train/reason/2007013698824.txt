The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that V2 (the Ford F250 pickup truck) had come to a stop in front of them. V1 stated that she did not realize V2 was stopped and thought he was still traveling at the posted speed limit. This indicates driver inattention on the part of V1. Additionally, V1 laid down several meters of skid marks, suggesting that she attempted to brake and avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time. This further supports the conclusion that V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and the actions of other vehicles. While V2 was waiting to make a left turn, the critical pre-crash event coded for V2 was "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with a higher speed." However, V2 was not assigned a critical reason, indicating that their actions did not contribute significantly to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver inattention and failure to notice that V2 had come to a stop.
