The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy and curved road conditions. The driver lost traction while negotiating the curve, crossed briefly into the opposing lane, and ultimately collided with trees off the road. The police reported travel speed of 48 kmph (below the speed limit of 72 kmph) indicates that the driver was still traveling too fast for the hazardous conditions, which led to the loss of control and subsequent collision.
