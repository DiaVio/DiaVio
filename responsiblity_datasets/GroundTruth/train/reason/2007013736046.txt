The driver of V1 stated that she swerved to avoid a cone in the road, which caused her to drive off the shoulder to the right. However, she then overcompensated and swerved back onto the roadway, crossing over into the left lane and ultimately rolling over to the left. The critical pre-crash event coded for V1 was "Object in roadway," indicating that the cone in the road was the trigger for the crash. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as "Driver related factor, overcompensation." This suggests that the driver's overreaction to the cone in the road, combined with her impaired vision and medical conditions, led to the loss of control and subsequent rollover. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and factors related to her health and vision impairment.
