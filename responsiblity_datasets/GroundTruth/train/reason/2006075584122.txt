The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was changing lanes without adequate surveillance, as stated in the Critical Reason for the Critical Event. The driver admitted to not seeing Vehicle two until it was too late, indicating a recognition error. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one was distracted by listening to the radio and looking in the rearview mirror while changing lanes. While Vehicle two was decelerating to merge left from the entrance ramp lane, it can be argued that the driver of Vehicle one should have been more attentive and aware of the surrounding traffic, especially since they were changing lanes. The fact that Vehicle one struck the rear of Vehicle two suggests that the driver of Vehicle one failed to maintain a safe following distance and react in a timely manner to the deceleration of Vehicle two. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and recognition error while changing lanes.
