The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 attempted to go around V2 without properly assessing the situation, assuming that V2 was parked on the side of the road. This false assumption led to V1 changing lanes and colliding with V2, causing the accident. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 was arrested for DUI during the interview, which further indicates their negligence and impaired judgment while operating the vehicle.
