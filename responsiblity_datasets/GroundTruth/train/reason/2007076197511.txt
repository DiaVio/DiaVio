The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that he noticed V2 stopped at the stop sign but thought that V2 would proceed. This false assumption led to V1 not maintaining a safe following distance and ultimately resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
