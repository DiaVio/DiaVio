The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when trying to avoid a traffic cone in the middle of lane two. This overcompensation caused V1 to veer off the right side of the roadway, collide with the jersey barrier, and then reenter the roadway, ultimately colliding with V2. V1's actions of abruptly steering right to avoid the traffic cone and then overcompensating by steering left resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle and subsequent collisions. Therefore, V1's overcompensation can be identified as the critical reason for the accident.
