The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, which was coded as a decision error. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 was following too closely in rush hour traffic, which further contributed to the crash. The weather conditions, including rain and a wet roadway, also played a role in the accident. Although Vehicle #1 (the 1998 Ford Econoline E-250 van) was cited for the accident with a failure to use due care, it was the failure of the driver of Vehicle #2 to control their vehicle that made the situation critical.
