The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was asleep at the time of the crash, which was identified as the critical reason for the critical event. The driver admitted to falling asleep prior to the collision, indicating that he was not in control of the vehicle and unable to respond to the road conditions appropriately. As a result, V1 veered off the road and collided with the traffic attenuator, causing the subsequent rollover and final rest in the exit lane.
