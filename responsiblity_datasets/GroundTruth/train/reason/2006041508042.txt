The reason for this is that the driver of V1 drove off the right side of the roadway for unknown reasons, resulting in the vehicle striking a large plastic garbage container and then a tree. Additionally, the driver and any other occupants fled the scene on foot prior to the arrival of rescue and police personnel. Therefore, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions of driving off the road and leaving the scene.
