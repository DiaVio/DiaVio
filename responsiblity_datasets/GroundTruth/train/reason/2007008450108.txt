The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the traffic light and collided with the rear of V2 (the Mercury Sable), causing a chain reaction collision with V3 (the Dodge Grand Caravan). This indicates that V1 did not exercise adequate surveillance and failed to observe the stopped vehicles ahead, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was driving without valid insurance, which further highlights their negligence and lack of responsibility.
