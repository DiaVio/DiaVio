The driver of Vehicle one admitted to being distracted by looking in his side mirror and not paying attention to the road ahead. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that Vehicle two (2001 Freightliner tractor with a trailer) had stopped in front of him due to traffic congestion. As a result, Vehicle one collided with the rear of Vehicle two. Although Vehicle two was traveling at a slower speed before coming to a stop, it is not considered the primary cause of the accident. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: traveling in the same direction with higher speed," indicating that Vehicle one was traveling at a higher speed than Vehicle two. However, the critical reason for this event was not attributed to Vehicle two. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident.
