The reason for this is that the driver of V1 drifted to the right of the travel lane, departed the roadway, and collided with a wooden utility pole. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver's fatigue-related partial sleep episode may have contributed to the loss of control and drifting off the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the potential influence of fatigue on their ability to drive safely.
