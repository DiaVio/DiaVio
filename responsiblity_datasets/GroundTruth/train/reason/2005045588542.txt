The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by reaching for a CD in the sunvisor, which caused him to momentarily look away from the road. When he refocused, he realized he was rapidly approaching a slowing non-contact vehicle ahead. In an attempt to avoid a collision, he steered left into the left lane, but lost control of the vehicle. He then overcompensated by steering right, crossing into the left lane again in a counterclockwise yaw before departing the left side of the road. The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, and the Critical Reason for this event was a performance error, specifically overcompensation. The driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper surveillance by not looking far enough ahead were also contributing factors.
