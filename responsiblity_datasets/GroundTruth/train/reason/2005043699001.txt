The driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive speed of approximately 121 kmph (75 mph) on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The driver admitted to joyriding and regularly practicing high-speed driving on this particular rural and curvy road. Despite the presence of a roadway design deficiency, where the radius of curvature did not meet the AASHTO standards, it is clear that the driver intentionally took the curve at an excessive rate of speed well above the posted limit. Therefore, the driver's decision to travel too fast for the conditions and his intentional disregard for the posted speed limit make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
