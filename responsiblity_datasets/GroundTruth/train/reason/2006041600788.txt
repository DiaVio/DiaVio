The reason for this is that V1 failed to use due care and was cited for driver recognition error and driver inattention. V1 was unable to slow down in time and struck the back of V2, indicating a lack of attention and failure to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 32 kmph, which suggests that V1 was not able to adjust to the congested traffic conditions appropriately.
