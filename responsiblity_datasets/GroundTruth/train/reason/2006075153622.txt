The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which directly led to the vehicle departing the roadway and contacting the guardrail. The driver's sleep apnea diagnosis, lack of sleep, and long working hours likely contributed to his drowsiness and inability to stay alert while driving. Additionally, the driver's medication may have had an impact on his level of alertness. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's negligence in operating the vehicle while fatigued and falling asleep at the wheel.
