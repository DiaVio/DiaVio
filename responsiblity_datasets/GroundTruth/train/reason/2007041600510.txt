The driver of V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the actions of others and failed to realize the need for caution due to the backed-up traffic. This resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2, which then caused a chain reaction involving V3 and V4. The driver of V1's story did not match the scene, vehicle damages, and the accounts of the other drivers involved in the crash.
