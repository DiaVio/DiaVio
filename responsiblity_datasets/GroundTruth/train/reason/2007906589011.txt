The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle Two failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. The associated factors coded to the driver of Vehicle Two include inadequate surveillance and failure to look on either side. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle Two did not exercise proper caution and failed to observe the oncoming Vehicle One (the 2001 New Flyer Large Passenger Bus) before entering the intersection. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle Two mentioned that he thought the traffic lights were not working properly, but it was later confirmed that the lights were functioning correctly for his direction. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle Two may have been distracted or not paying full attention to the road conditions. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Vehicle Two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and failure to look for oncoming traffic.
