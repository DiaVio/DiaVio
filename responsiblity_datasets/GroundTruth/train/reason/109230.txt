The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 reportedly confused the gas and brake pedals, causing the vehicle to accelerate instead of braking. This led to V1 departing the right side of the exit ramp and subsequently colliding with multiple objects, including a tree and a well head/pump. The driver's confusion and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle directly contributed to the accident.
