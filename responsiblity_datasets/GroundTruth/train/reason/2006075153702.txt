The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by talking to her sister and looking at the passenger before the crash occurred. This distraction likely caused her to not notice that V2 (the Dodge Ram with trailer) was stopped in front of her, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she was traveling at approximately 48 kmph (30 mph) before the crash, which indicates that she was not maintaining a safe following distance. While rush hour congestion was mentioned as an associated factor for both vehicles, it does not absolve the driver of V1 from responsibility. It is the responsibility of every driver to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them and to remain attentive to the road conditions, regardless of traffic congestion. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to driver distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
