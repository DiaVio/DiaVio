The driver of V1 was distracted and looking at something on the floor prior to the crash, which is considered a driver-related factor. This distraction likely caused the driver of V1 to fail in their attempt to avoid a collision with V2 (the 2001 Ford Escape) and resulted in the front of V1 striking the back of V2.
