The reason for this is that Vehicle # 3 failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle # 2 (the Chevrolet Astrovan) and subsequently collided with the back of Vehicle # 2. This caused Vehicle # 2 to then collide with the back of Vehicle # 1 (the Dodge Neon). The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle # 3 was coded as "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that Vehicle # 3 should have been aware of the stopped vehicles ahead and taken appropriate action to avoid a collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle # 3 was coded as an unknown driver-related error, suggesting that the driver of Vehicle # 3 may have been at fault for not reacting in time to the stopped vehicles ahead. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle # 3 is primarily responsible for the accident.
