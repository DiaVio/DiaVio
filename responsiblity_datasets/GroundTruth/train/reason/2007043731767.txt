The reason for this is that V2 was frequently changing lanes, which is considered aggressive driving behavior. This behavior increases the risk of accidents, especially when done at high speeds on a multi-lane highway. Additionally, V2 struck the back of V1, indicating that V2 was not maintaining a safe following distance. V2's attempt to leave the scene without being caught further demonstrates a lack of responsibility.
