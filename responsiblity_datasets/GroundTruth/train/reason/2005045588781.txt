The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield and ran a red light, according to all the witnesses. The police also charged the driver with failure to yield. Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver was found to have made a recognition error due to inattention, possibly caused by fatigue. The driver admitted to averaging only 4.5 hours of sleep per night and having gotten only 3.5 hours of sleep the previous night. Inexperienced driving and conversing with the passenger at the time of the collision were also contributing factors. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Impala) was stopped at the intersection for several seconds and began crossing when the traffic signal changed to green. The driver of Vehicle #2 did not contribute to the critical event, as per the available information. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield, running a red light, and other contributing factors such as fatigue and inattention.
