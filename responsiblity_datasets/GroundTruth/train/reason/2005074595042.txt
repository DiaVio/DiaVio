The driver of V1 made several errors that contributed to the collision. Firstly, they received instructions from a passenger to turn left while already in the intersection, which indicates a lack of focus on the road and failure to adhere to traffic rules. Additionally, the driver panicked and was unable to find the gas pedal, further demonstrating a lack of control and preparedness in a critical situation. While V2 (the 1990 Cadillac Sedan DeVille) did notice V1 stop at the intersection and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering to the left, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their errors and lack of control.
