The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center lane lines while negotiating the curve and entered into the southbound lane, causing the collision with Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2013 Toyota Prius. V1 attempted to brake and move to the right partially on the shoulder to avoid the collision, but V2 overpowered V1 and forced it rearward to its final rest position. Additionally, V2 went on to impact the guard rail after the collision. Therefore, V2's actions of crossing into the opposite lane and causing the collision indicate that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
