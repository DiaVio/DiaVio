The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver of V1 admitted to holding a cell phone in his right hand, indicating that his attention was diverted from the driving task. This inattention likely caused him to miss the red light and collide with V2 (the 1987 Honda Accord sedan) that had the right of way. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that they had a green light and that V1 appeared out of nowhere, further supporting the notion that V1 was at fault for not stopping at the red light. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and their inattention due to cell phone use make them primarily responsible for the collision.
