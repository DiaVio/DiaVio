The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one made a false assumption of the other driver's actions. Even though she had a circular green light to make a left turn, she assumed that the driver of vehicle two would stop for her. This false assumption led to her pulling out in front of vehicle two, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, there is no critical reason coded for vehicle two, indicating that the driver of vehicle two did not contribute to the accident.
