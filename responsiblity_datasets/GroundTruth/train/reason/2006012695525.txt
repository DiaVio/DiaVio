The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the road, which was ice-covered and full of potholes. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and critical reason coded as "vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions" and "too fast for conditions - ice-covered road with potholes." Additionally, the driver's own statement indicates that he did not apply the brakes and instead accelerated immediately before impact, suggesting a lack of proper control and judgment. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust their speed and control the vehicle appropriately for the road conditions makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
