The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to the icy road conditions. This resulted in V1 departing from the right side of the road, striking a wire fence, and colliding with a large tree. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle on the icy road indicates a lack of caution and appropriate driving behavior for the prevailing conditions.
