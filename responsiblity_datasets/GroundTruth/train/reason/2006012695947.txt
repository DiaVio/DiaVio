The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to slow down behind V2, resulting in the front of V1 striking the back of V2. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and did not maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by dropping her cell phone and looking down to retrieve it, which further contributed to her failure to notice V2 slowing down. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and being distracted by a cell phone are the main reasons for their responsibility in the crash.
