The driver of V1 stated that he had to wait for a truck in lane two to pass before making his lane change. However, he failed to adequately surveil the area and did not see V2 (the 2000 Ford Focus) prior to the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver failed to look or looked but did not see V2. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, specifically from the adjacent lane (same direction) over the left lane line. While V2's driver also had an associated factor of inadequate surveillance, it was V1's failure to properly observe the surroundings and make a safe lane change that led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 before making the lane change.
