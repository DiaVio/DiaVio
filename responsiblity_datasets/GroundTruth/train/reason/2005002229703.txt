The driver of Vehicle #1 was negotiating a curve to the left and went off the roadway onto the shoulder. However, instead of correcting the vehicle properly, the driver overcorrected and departed the roadway on the opposite side, resulting in a rollover. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling Off the Edge of the Road on the Right Side," and the critical reason for this event was "Driver Related Factor Poor Directional Control (failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." The driver's statement of hitting black ice was not supported by evidence at the scene, and the police did not consider alcohol or illegal drugs to be a factor. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as she is still enrolled in a driver's education course, may have contributed to the poor directional control and inability to properly handle the vehicle in the curve.
