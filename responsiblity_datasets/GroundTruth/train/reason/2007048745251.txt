The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver stated that V2 was in his blind spot and he did not see it prior to the crash. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to properly check their blind spot and ensure it was clear before proceeding into the intersection. As a result, the front of the rear trailer tires of V1 struck the left side of V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "vehicle related vision obstructions," suggesting that there may have been factors within V1's vehicle that obstructed their vision and contributed to the failure to see V2. Overall, V1's failure to see V2 in their blind spot and the presence of vision obstructions in their vehicle make them primarily responsible for the crash.
