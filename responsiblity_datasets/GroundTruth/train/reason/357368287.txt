The reason for this is that V2 entered into the case vehicle's lane and struck the right-rear door of the case vehicle with its left-fender. This impact caused the driver of the case vehicle to lose control and ultimately collide with a concrete barrier. Additionally, V2 drove away from the scene in a hit and run fashion, further indicating their responsibility for the accident.
