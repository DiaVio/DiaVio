The reason for this is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a right sweeping curve on an icy road. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle under the prevailing road and weather conditions, leading to the rollover accident. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of the accident.
