The reason for V2's responsibility is that V2 rear-ended V1 (the Ford Explorer) in lane one. V2's driver stated that V1 merged into his lane and braked abruptly, but he was unable to avoid the collision. However, V2's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react in time to V1's lane change and deceleration indicates a lack of adequate surveillance and driver awareness. This suggests that V2's driver was not maintaining a proper lookout and did not leave enough space between his vehicle and V1, resulting in the rear-end collision.
