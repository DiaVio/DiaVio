The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, with a BAC level of .265, which is significantly above the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to control the vehicle and resulted in the collision. Additionally, the witness statement indicates that V1 had been swerving prior to the crash, further suggesting that the driver was not in proper control of the vehicle.
