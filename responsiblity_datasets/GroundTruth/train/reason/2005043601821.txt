The reason for V1's primary responsibility is driver inattention, as indicated by the Critical Reason for the Critical Event being coded as such. V1 claimed that another vehicle cut off the tractor-trailer and caused everyone to suddenly stop, but there is no evidence or mention of any other vehicle involved in the collision. V1's failure to pay attention to the traffic ahead and stop in time resulted in the rear-end collision with V2. Additionally, V2 (the driver of the 2005 International straight truck) had been stop-and-go due to heavy traffic and had stopped again before being rear-ended. V2 was following the flow of traffic and had no reason to expect a sudden stop from V1. V2's actions do not indicate any negligence or fault in this collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to driver inattention.
