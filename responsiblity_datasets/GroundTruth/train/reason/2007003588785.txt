The driver of V2 admitted to disregarding the red light, which indicates a clear violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver resulted in the collision with V1 (the Honda Odyssey), which had the green light according to the driver of V1 and a witness. Therefore, V2's failure to stop for the traffic control device and not having the right-of-way makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
