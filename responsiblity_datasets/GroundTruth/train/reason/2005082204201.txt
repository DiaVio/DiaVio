The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve, which caused the vehicle to lose traction and slide into the oncoming lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2). Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of 0.12, which indicates that they were driving under the influence of alcohol. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
