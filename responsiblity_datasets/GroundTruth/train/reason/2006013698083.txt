The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to look properly before proceeding through the intersection. The driver admitted that she did not see V2 until she pulled out onto the road, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming vehicle. This failure to look and see the approaching vehicle resulted in the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1 was talking to her passenger (daughter) at the time of the crash suggests a potential distraction, which could have contributed to the driver's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to look and see the approaching vehicle, combined with a potential distraction, makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
