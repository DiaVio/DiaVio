The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions, assuming that V2 was making a left turn into a medical building parking lot. This false assumption led the driver of V1 to turn left in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported turning at a speed of about 6 kmph (4 mph), which indicates a lack of caution and awareness of the oncoming traffic. While V2 (the Acura Vigor) was traveling slightly above the posted speed limit, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering to the right upon seeing V1 turn in front of her. This suggests that V2 reacted appropriately to the situation, but was unable to avoid the collision due to the sudden and unexpected turn by V1. Overall, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the false assumption and lack of caution while making the left turn.
