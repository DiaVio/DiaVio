The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 1995 Lexus ES300). V1's obstructed view due to focusing on the stopped vehicles and not seeing V2 prior to the crash contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
