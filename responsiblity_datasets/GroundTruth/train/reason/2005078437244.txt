The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in the number one lane, then entered the right turn lane and made a left turn to cross the north/south roadway. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the 2005 Mercury Mariner) traveling in the number two lane. V1's actions of crossing the roadway without ensuring it was clear resulted in the collision with V2.
