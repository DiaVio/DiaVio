The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the falling canes inside the vehicle, which caused her to take her eyes off the road and fail to realize that she was too close to V2 (the Chevrolet Malibu) in front of her. This distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance led to the collision between V1 and V2.
