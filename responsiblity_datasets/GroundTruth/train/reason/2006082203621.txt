The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway and struck multiple objects, including concrete poles and a fence. - The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted, thinking about her daughter's timeliness, which indicates a lack of attention to the driving task. - V1's driver also mentioned seeing a small animal in the roadway and applied the brakes, steering right, which resulted in the vehicle traveling on the shoulder and ultimately colliding with the poles. - Additionally, the driver's near-sightedness and failure to wear corrective lenses further contributed to the lack of proper control over the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control, inattention to the driving task, and failure to wear corrective eyewear.
