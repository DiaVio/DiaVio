The reason for this is that V1 departed the right road edge and traveled over the embankment, ultimately colliding with various objects before coming to a rest. The driver of V1 admitted to being tired and a little sleepy at the time of the crash, indicating a potential lapse in attention and alertness. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road, on the right side, with the critical reason being a driver-related factor of sleeping, indicating that the driver was actually asleep. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of being tired and sleepy, as well as the evidence of the vehicle leaving the road and the critical pre-crash event being related to the driver being asleep, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
