The reason for this is that V2 failed to exercise adequate surveillance by not looking to the side ahead before entering the intersection. The driver of V2 was engaged in a conversation with her mother and was unfamiliar with the roadway, which likely contributed to her failure to notice V1 approaching from the right. Additionally, the driver of V2 had only been driving for 7 months at the time of the crash, indicating a lack of experience on the road. While the driver of V1 was also cited for inadequate surveillance and an illegal maneuver by proceeding through a traffic control device while the signal was red, it is important to note that V1 was already in the intersection when it was struck by V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for failing to exercise proper surveillance and causing the collision.
