The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the actions of V2 (the 31-year-old female driving the 1999 Ford Taurus SE sedan). V1 assumed that V2 would stop for the red traffic signal, even though V2 was approaching the intersection. This false assumption led to V1 proceeding with the left turn and ultimately colliding with V2. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1 had a passenger and was in a hurry to get his sister to school, which may have contributed to the driver's decision-making and false assumption. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to yield the right of way at the intersection make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
