The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically heavy fog and an icy roadway. The driver lost control of the vehicle when it encountered black ice, resulting in the vehicle sliding left and right before going off the roadway and rolling over onto its roof. The driver's attempt to avoid oncoming traffic by steering right ultimately led to the crash. It is important to note that the police did not find any evidence of illegal drugs or alcohol involvement, and the driver was not tested for these substances.
