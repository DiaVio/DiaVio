The reason for this is that V1 was departing a two-lane public driveway and failed to yield the right of way to V2, the 1999 Oldsmobile 88, which was traveling on the main roadway. V1 crossed the centerline and entered the path of V2, resulting in a collision. Additionally, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within its lane suggests negligence on the part of the driver. The fact that V1 came to rest in the northbound lane facing south further indicates that V1 was not properly positioned or traveling in the correct direction. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
