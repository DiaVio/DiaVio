The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to make a left turn into a driveway. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 did not use a turn signal, further contributing to the driver's failure to communicate their intentions to other road users. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
