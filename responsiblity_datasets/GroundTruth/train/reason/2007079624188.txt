The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. This resulted in a near-collision with the non-contact vehicle (2001 Infiniti I30) in the adjacent lane. In response to this near-collision, the driver of V1 overcompensated by swerving back into the original lane, causing the vehicle to fish-tail and ultimately roll over. Additionally, the driver of V1 has a history of a similar incident where the vehicle fish-tailed and struck a raised asphalt curb. This suggests a pattern of reckless driving behavior or lack of control over the vehicle. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the history of similar incidents, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
