The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling too fast for the curve, as indicated by the fact that she was traveling between 31-40 MPH in an area with a posted speed limit of 45 MPH and an advisory speed of 30 MPH. Additionally, the driver was not familiar with the curvy nature of the road and had limited experience driving the vehicle. The driver's possible fatigue and alcohol presence may have also contributed to her decision error of traveling too fast for the curve. Furthermore, the roadway-related factor of the curve not meeting AASHTO design standards suggests that the curve may have been more challenging to navigate than anticipated. However, this does not absolve the driver of Vehicle #1 from responsibility, as she should have adjusted her speed accordingly. The police also indicated alcohol involvement and issued a citation to the driver of Vehicle #1, further suggesting that her impaired judgment and decision-making may have played a role in the crash. Overall, the driver of Vehicle #1's excessive speed, lack of familiarity with the road, possible fatigue, and potential alcohol impairment make her primarily responsible for the crash.
