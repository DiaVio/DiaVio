The driver of Vehicle One entered the intersection on a red light and was constantly on the cell phone during the interview. This indicates that the driver was not paying attention to the road and failed to obey traffic signals, leading to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle Two (the 2002 Nissan Altima) had a green light and was proceeding through the intersection as expected. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, across path," suggesting that Vehicle One crossed into the path of Vehicle Two. Therefore, Vehicle One's inattention and failure to obey traffic signals make them primarily responsible for the accident.
