The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the far right, southbound travel lane and intended to cross through the intersection. However, it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Honda Accord) which was traveling westbound in the center westbound through lane. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1, causing the collision.
