The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn through the intersection, and V2 (the 2004 GMC Yukon) was traveling straight in the southbound lane. V1 initiated its turn without yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2. V2's driver stated that he saw V1 approaching the intersection and attempted to steer right while braking, but was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. This indicates that V2 was taking appropriate action to avoid the crash, while V1 failed to yield and caused the collision.
