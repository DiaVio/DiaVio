The driver of V2 was turning left across the northbound traffic, assuming that the traffic would yield the right-of-way. However, V1 was traveling in the northbound lane and had the right-of-way. V2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, a witness stated that the vehicle ahead of him stopped and waived V2 across the roadway, which indicates that V2 may have been encouraged to make the left turn without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. Therefore, V2's false assumption of other's actions and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
