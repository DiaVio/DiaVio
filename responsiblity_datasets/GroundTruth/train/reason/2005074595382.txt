The reason for this is that the driver of V1 suffered a heart attack while driving, which impaired his ability to act and control the vehicle. The witness reported that V1 was stopped in the intersection for several minutes before suddenly accelerating forward. This erratic behavior, along with the subsequent loss of control and collision with the fence and telephone pole, can be attributed to the driver's physical impairment caused by the heart attack. The driver's medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, and the stress from an IRS audit, further supports the conclusion that the heart attack was the primary cause of the accident.
