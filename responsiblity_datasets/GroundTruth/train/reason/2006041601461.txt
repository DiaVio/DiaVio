The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed (161kmph or 100 mph) in a curve with a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65mph). This indicates that the driver was exceeding the speed limit and driving too fast for the curve. Additionally, the driver admitted to driving at high rates of speed daily on this particular roadway, indicating a pattern of reckless driving behavior. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience as a 17-year-old and her admission of being in a hurry (late for curfew) contribute to her decision error of driving too fast for the curve. These factors suggest a lack of judgment and responsibility on the part of the driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error of driving too fast for the curve, inexperience, and reckless driving behavior.
