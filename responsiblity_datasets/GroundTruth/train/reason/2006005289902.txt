The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed over the double yellow line in order to position his vehicle to back into his driveway. This action of crossing over the double yellow line indicates a violation of traffic rules and improper lane usage. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look far enough ahead before beginning the maneuver into the driveway also contributed to the crash. It is important to note that the driver of V2 (the 2006 Toyota Scion) could not be contacted for an interview, and there is limited information available about their actions or potential contribution to the crash. However, based on the available information, V1's actions and violations make them primarily responsible for the collision.
