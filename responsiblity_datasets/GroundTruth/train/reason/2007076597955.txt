The reason for V1's responsibility is that the camp trailer broke loose from the trailer hitch and crossed the center line, resulting in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 stated that he heard a grind noise and saw the trailer crossing the center line in his left door mirror. This indicates that there was a failure in the trailer attachment, leading to the detachment of the trailer from the truck. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the opposite direction and had just entered the bridge when the trailer came into her lane. She stated that she tried to avoid the oncoming trailer by slamming on her brakes but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure in properly attaching and securing the camp trailer, which resulted in its detachment and subsequent collision with V2.
