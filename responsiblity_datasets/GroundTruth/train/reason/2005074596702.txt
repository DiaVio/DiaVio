The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the adjacent traffic moving forward, which caused him to make a false assumption that vehicles in his lane were also moving forward. This external distraction led to the driver of V1 failing to recognize that V2 (the 2005 tan Jeep Grand Cherokee) had stopped in front of him, resulting in the collision.
