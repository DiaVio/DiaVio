The reason for this is that V2 turned left in front of V1, causing the collision. Additionally, it was reported by witnesses and the driver of V1 that the driver of V2 appeared to be suffering from a seizure at the time of the crash. This physical impairment likely impaired the driver's ability to act and make safe driving decisions, leading to the collision.
