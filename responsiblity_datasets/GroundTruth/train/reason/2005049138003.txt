The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver did not attempt to avoid the debris in the roadway, which ultimately caused the vehicle to lose control and collide with the concrete median barrier. Additionally, the driver was following too closely to the vehicle in front, which limited her ability to react and perform any evasive maneuvers. Therefore, V1's failure to avoid the debris and maintain a safe following distance contributed to the accident and makes her primarily responsible.
