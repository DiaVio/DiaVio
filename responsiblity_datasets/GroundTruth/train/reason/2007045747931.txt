The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, as evidenced by the fact that she did not see V2 approaching from the east. The driver's claim that her view was obstructed by a tree was contradicted by the researcher's scene photos, which showed that her view to the left was not obstructed. Additionally, the driver's emotional state and concerns over family problems may have contributed to her inattention and inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Chrysler Voyager) reported that he was traveling at the speed limit and noticed V1 approaching his path without stopping. However, V2's critical reason for the critical event was not coded, and there is no evidence to suggest that the driver of V2 was at fault. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to look, as well as her emotional state and concerns over family problems.
