The driver of V2, while attempting a left turn at the T-intersection, failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and did not see V1 approaching. This is evidenced by the fact that V2 had a stop sign and had stopped before initiating the turn. Additionally, the driver of V2 was using unidentified prescription medications for the treatment of high blood pressure and diabetes, which may have impaired her ability to properly perceive and react to the traffic situation.
