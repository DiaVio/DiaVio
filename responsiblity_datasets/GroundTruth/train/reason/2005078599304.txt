The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was not paying attention to the road and was daydreaming while conversing with her passengers. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as driver-related factor: inattention. As a result of her inattention, V1 failed to notice that V2 had stopped ahead of her and collided with the rear of V2. V2, on the other hand, was well-rested and familiar with the route, indicating that he was not at fault for the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as another vehicle in the traffic lane, traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, suggesting that V2 was not the cause of the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
