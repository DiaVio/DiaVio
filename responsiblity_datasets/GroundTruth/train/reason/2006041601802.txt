The reason for this is that V1, the unidentified vehicle, was changing lanes into lane two where V2 was already traveling. V1's front left corner made contact with the right rear of V2, causing V2 to lose control of his vehicle and ultimately crash into the concrete barrier. Additionally, V1 fled the scene without stopping, which further indicates their responsibility for the accident.
