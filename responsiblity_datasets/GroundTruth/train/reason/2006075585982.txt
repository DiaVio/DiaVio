The reason for this is that Vehicle two made a wide right turn from the stop sign, which resulted in the collision with Vehicle one (1993 Honda Accord). Vehicle two's wide turn indicates a failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically Vehicle one. This failure to yield and the subsequent impact caused both vehicles to rotate and resulted in significant damage to Vehicle two, leading to its tow. Without further information about the driver of Vehicle one, it is difficult to determine if any contributing factors from their side played a role in the accident. However, based on the given details, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle two due to the improper right turn maneuver.
