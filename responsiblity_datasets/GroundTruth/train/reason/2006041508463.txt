The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 overreacted to the situation caused by the phantom vehicle abruptly changing lanes in front of her. This overreaction led to the loss of control of her vehicle, resulting in V1 veering across multiple lanes of traffic and making contact with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, unfamiliar with the roadway, and not comfortable with the borrowed vehicle she was driving. These factors contributed to her inability to properly handle the situation and maintain control of her vehicle. On the other hand, V2 (the Honda Accord) managed to keep control of her vehicle despite the sudden lane change by the phantom vehicle. Therefore, V2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the accident.
