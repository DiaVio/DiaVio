The driver of V1 was traveling in the sixth travel lane and cut across all six lanes of traffic to take the exit ramp. This action of changing lanes when unsafe and failing to signal indicates a lack of caution and disregard for other drivers on the road. The critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the right side of travel lane," further supports the driver's aggressive driving behavior. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1996 Honda Accord wagon) was simply driving in the first travel lane and did not have any contributing factors that would make them primarily responsible for the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V2, which was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from adjacent lane-over the left lane line," suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their aggressive driving behavior and unsafe lane changes.
