The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a 3-point turn in the travel lane, which is a dangerous and illegal maneuver. This movement by V1 imposed upon the travel of V2, who was going straight. V1's improper and unexpected action of backing up in the travel lane to make the turn created a hazardous situation for other drivers, including V2. While V2 may have been traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others and may have been affected by sun glare, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an improper and unsafe maneuver on the roadway. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their improper 3-point turn in the travel lane, which imposed upon the travel of V2.
