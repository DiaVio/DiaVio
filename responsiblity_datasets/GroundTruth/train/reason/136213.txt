The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it struck two mailboxes, sideswiped a tree, and then ultimately crashed into a tree with the front end. The driver of V1 sustained multiple injuries, including rib fractures, sternal fracture, liver laceration, vertebral fractures, humerus fracture, maxilla fractures, and intraspinous ligament injury. These injuries indicate the severity of the impact and suggest that V1 was the main vehicle involved in the crash. Additionally, the case mentions that the driver of V1 was semi-conscious throughout the crash sequence due to a pre-existing medical condition. This could have impaired his ability to control the vehicle and react appropriately to the road conditions, further contributing to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
