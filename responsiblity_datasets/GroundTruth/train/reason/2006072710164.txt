The driver of V1 admitted to merging without looking to her right, indicating inadequate surveillance. This action resulted in V1 crossing over the right travel lane and colliding with the back left corner of V2 (1996 Honda Odyssey). Although V2 was encroaching into the left lane, the critical reason for the pre-crash event was not coded to V2. Therefore, V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the crash. In summary, V1's failure to properly merge and inadequate surveillance led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
