The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by looking into the store to see who was working, which caused him to not notice that V2 (the Chevrolet Malibu sedan) had stopped in front of him with its left turn signal on. Additionally, V1 mentioned that his brakes were not in the best condition, which could have contributed to his inability to stop in time and avoid the collision. Furthermore, V1 is an inexperienced driver, having been driving for less than a year, which may have also played a role in his inability to react appropriately in this situation.
