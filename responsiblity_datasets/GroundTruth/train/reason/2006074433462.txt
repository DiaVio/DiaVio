The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one made an abrupt right turn at the intersection, causing the vehicle to slide over the center lane and collide with the front of Vehicle two (the 2000 Mack truck). The driver of Vehicle one was not familiar with the roadway and lacked experience, which contributed to her failure to proceed with appropriate caution. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning right at intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for curve/turn." On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two was well-rested, familiar with his route and vehicle, and attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering right. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction" and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's abrupt turn and lack of experience.
