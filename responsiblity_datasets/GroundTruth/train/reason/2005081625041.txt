The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 31-year-old male, departed the roadway to the right shoulder and struck the rear of the disabled/abandoned V2. V1's poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event, played a significant role in the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as determined by the investigating officer. These factors indicate that V1's actions and impairment were the main contributing factors to the collision.
