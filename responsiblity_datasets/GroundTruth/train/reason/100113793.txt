The reason for this is that the driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to travel off the right roadside while negotiating a left curve uphill. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane of travel. As a result, V1 crossed the centerline and entered the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2006 Chrysler Town & Country minivan, causing the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the seat belt restraint, which further contributes to their responsibility for the accident. Seat belt usage is crucial for ensuring the safety of occupants in a vehicle, and the failure to use the restraint increases the risk of injury in the event of a collision. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and their lack of seat belt usage.
