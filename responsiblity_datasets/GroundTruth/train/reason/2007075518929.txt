The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking to the left, trying to determine if he could turn left at the intersection. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that traffic had stopped ahead of him, resulting in the collision with the back of V2 (the 1999 Honda Civic). Additionally, the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 32 kmph, indicating that V1 was not traveling at an excessive speed. V2 was stopped for 5-10 seconds prior to the impact, suggesting that V1 had enough time to react and avoid the collision if he had been paying attention. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance, inadequate surveillance, and distraction while driving make him primarily responsible for the accident.
