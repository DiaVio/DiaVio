The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by talking on his cell phone, reading his mail, and drinking a soft drink. Witnesses at the scene also reported seeing the driver on the phone just prior to the crash. This indicates that the driver's internal distractions contributed to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distracted driving behavior.
