The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 crossed the centerline into the path of Vehicle 1 (2003 Mazda Tribute compact utility vehicle), causing the collision. Vehicle 1 was proceeding straight on the eastbound lane, while Vehicle 2 was negotiating a right curve on a downhill slope on the westbound lane. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to maintain its lane and encroached into the opposing lane, resulting in the collision.
