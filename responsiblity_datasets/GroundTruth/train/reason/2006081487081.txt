The reason for this is that V1 was internally distracted, looking at his directions instead of paying attention to the road ahead. When he looked up, he noticed V2 slowing or stopping but was unable to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a proper lookout and failed to react in a timely manner to the traffic conditions. Additionally, V1 attempted to avoid V2 by steering to the left and braking, suggesting that V1 was aware of the situation but failed to take appropriate evasive action to prevent the collision. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain a proper lookout and react appropriately make them primarily responsible for the collision.
