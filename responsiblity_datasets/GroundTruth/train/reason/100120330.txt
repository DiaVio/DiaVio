The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound in the designated left turn lane and turned left into the path of V1, the 2006 Lincoln Zephyr sedan. V1 was traveling westbound in the number four lane with the intention to travel straight through the intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, but V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
