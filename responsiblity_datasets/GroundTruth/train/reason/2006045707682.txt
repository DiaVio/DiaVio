The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way while attempting to turn left from the shopping center driveway onto the arterial roadway. Despite being waved out by a non-contact vehicle, Vehicle #1 proceeded into the roadway without ensuring that it was clear. This decision error, along with an inadequate surveillance factor of looking but not seeing, led to the collision with Vehicle #2. Vehicle #1 was also cited by the police for failure to yield. On the other hand, Vehicle #2's critical reason for the pre-crash event was not coded, indicating that the driver of Vehicle #2 did not contribute significantly to the accident. However, the driver of Vehicle #2 was charged with driving on a suspended license and provided false contact information to the police, which are separate issues unrelated to the cause of the accident.
