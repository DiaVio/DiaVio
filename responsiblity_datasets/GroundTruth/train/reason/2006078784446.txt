The reason for this is that the driver of V-2 attempted to turn left across the path of V-1 without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver of V-2 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not look or see V-1 approaching from behind. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance led to the collision.
