The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the left side." This indicates that Vehicle One crossed over into the second lane, where Vehicle Two (the 2001 GMC Sierra) was traveling. This action by Vehicle One resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle One reported that he blacked out just before the crash, attributing it to a new medication he had received for prostate cancer. This suggests that the driver's medical condition and the effects of the medication may have impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Therefore, based on the critical pre-crash event and the driver's medical condition, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the collision.
