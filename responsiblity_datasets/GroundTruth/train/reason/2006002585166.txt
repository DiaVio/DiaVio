The driver of V1 admitted to feeling drowsy and having an irregular sleep schedule. He also mentioned taking medication for depression, which made him very sleepy. Additionally, he had poor vision and was wearing bifocals. These factors, combined with the driver engaging in strenuous recreational activities prior to the crash, indicate that he was not in a suitable condition to operate a vehicle safely. Falling asleep at the wheel and veering off the road to strike a tree suggests a driver-related non-performance error, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
