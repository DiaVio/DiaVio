The driver of V1 stated that he noticed the vehicle in front of him having trouble controlling her vehicle. However, he failed to maintain a safe distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision when the vehicle in front of him suddenly stopped. This indicates a driver decision error of following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe following distance and respond appropriately to the sudden stop of the vehicle ahead.
