The reason for this is that the injuries sustained by the unrestrained right-front passenger, including head injuries, facial fractures, sternum fractures, liver laceration, rib fractures, wrist fracture, and bladder rupture, are all attributed to contact with the protruding center instrument panel and the deployed airbag of Vehicle 1. These injuries indicate that the passenger was forcefully thrown forward and made contact with the interior components of Vehicle 1, resulting in severe injuries that ultimately led to her death.
