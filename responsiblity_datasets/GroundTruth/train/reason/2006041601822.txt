The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control of the truck due to a tire blowout/flat tire. The left rear tire had a complete tread separation, causing the driver to lose control and ultimately resulting in the rollover accident. The driver's attempt to steer and brake hard was not enough to prevent the truck from departing the roadway and rolling over. Additionally, the presence of unsecured cargo in the bed of the truck may have contributed to the loss of control. It is important to note that there were no other vehicles involved in the crash and the driver of Vehicle #1 was not injured.
