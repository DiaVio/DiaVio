The reason for this is that V1 swerved to the right to avoid the non-contact van that turned left and stopped in the northbound lane. However, V1 then over-corrected and swerved back to the left, crossing the centerline and ultimately colliding head-on with V2 in the southbound lane. This indicates that V1's actions, specifically the overcompensation and loss of control, directly led to the collision with V2.
