The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 while it was stopped in the roadway, indicating that V1 was following too closely or failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 then departed the right side of the roadway and ultimately collided with a tree, suggesting a loss of control by the driver of V1.
