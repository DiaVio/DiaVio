The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the left-turn lane of V1, which resulted in the collision. V1 had the right of way as it was making a left turn on a green light, while V2 should have stayed in its own lane and yielded to V1. Therefore, V2's failure to stay in its lane and encroaching into the left-turn lane of V1 caused the accident.
