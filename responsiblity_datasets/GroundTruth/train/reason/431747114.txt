The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the left side surface of Vehicle 1 (the 2002 BMW 325Ci convertible) as both vehicles entered the intersection. This initial impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate counterclockwise and subsequently collide with other objects, resulting in damage to Vehicle 1 and serious injury to its driver. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 caused the chain of events leading to the accident.
