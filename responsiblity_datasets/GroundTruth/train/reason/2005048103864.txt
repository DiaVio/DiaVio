The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the roadway to the left, causing the crash. The driver of V1 stated that a vehicle cut him off, but there is no evidence or mention of another vehicle involved in the crash. Additionally, the driver's admission of being distracted by opening an audio compact disc out of its plastic wrap indicates a driver-related factor contributing to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
