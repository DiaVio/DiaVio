The reason for this is that V1 was traveling through the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical reason assigned to V1 is "Driver Related Factor: Inadequate Surveillance." This suggests that V1 did not properly observe the traffic signal or failed to notice the oncoming bus before entering the intersection. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Gilli Metro bus) was stopped in the traffic lane and proceeded on the green light, which indicates that V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
