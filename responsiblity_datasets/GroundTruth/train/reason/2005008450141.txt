The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to adequately surveil the eastbound roadway before making a left turn out of the parking lot. Despite the presence of the tree/planter box partially obscuring the view, the driver of Vehicle 2 stated that he could still see the roadway. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 2 mentioned that he noted the traffic signal at the nearby intersection was red, indicating that he should have been more cautious and aware of oncoming traffic. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
