The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as crossing over (passing through) the intersection, indicating that V1 went through a red light. Witnesses at the scene claimed that the light had turned green for north/south traffic, further supporting the notion that V1 ran a red light. Additionally, associated factors coded to V1 include speeding and aggressive driving. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and engage in illegal maneuvering by running a red light makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
