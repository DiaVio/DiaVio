The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver drifted left into lane 2, onto the inside shoulder, and then back across both eastbound lanes before exiting the roadway to the right. This indicates a lack of control and proper lane discipline, which ultimately led to the vehicle striking the cement wall/bridge railing and rolling over. Additionally, the driver's focus to the left instead of forward, discomfort with handling the truck while pulling the empty trailer, lack of driver's training, and lack of knowledge of the roadway all contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
