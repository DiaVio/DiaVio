The reason for this is that the driver was in control of the vehicle and made the decisions that led to the collision with the stone wall. The driver's actions, such as striking the curb with the right front wheel and being in a slight left turn, contributed to the accident. Additionally, the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision ultimately resulted in the injuries sustained by the right front passenger.
