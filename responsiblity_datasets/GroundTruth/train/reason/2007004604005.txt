The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to turn left at the intersection. The driver of V1 believed they could complete the turn before V2 entered the intersection, but they failed to do so, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been licensed for less than one year, indicating driver inexperience as an associated factor.
