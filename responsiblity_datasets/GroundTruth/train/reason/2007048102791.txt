The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was unable to successfully respond to the fallen object in the roadway. Despite attempting to steer right to avoid the object, the vehicle initiated a clockwise rotation and ultimately slid off the north side of the roadway. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to respond effectively to the situation. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 113 kmph, which suggests that the vehicle may have been traveling too fast for the conditions. This further supports the conclusion that V1's speed and inability to respond appropriately to the fallen object contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
