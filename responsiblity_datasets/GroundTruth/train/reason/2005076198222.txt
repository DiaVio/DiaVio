The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a sixteen-year-old male, was distracted by adjusting the radio controls while driving. This internal distraction caused V1 to veer off the road on the left side initially, and then over-steer and cross into the southbound lane before ultimately colliding with a fence and a tree. Additionally, the driver's lack of experience, having only been driving for about one year, may have contributed to their inability to properly handle the situation and regain control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1's driver-related factor of internal distraction and lack of experience make them primarily responsible for the crash.
