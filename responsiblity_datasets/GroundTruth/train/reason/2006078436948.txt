The reason for V-1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V-1 stated that she was confused about whether she had the green arrow to make the left turn. Despite this confusion, she proceeded to make the left turn without properly checking for oncoming traffic. This failure to look and see the approaching Vehicle two (V-2) resulted in the collision.
