The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield and did not adequately surveil the roadway before entering. The driver of V2 stated that they looked left, right, and left again before starting the turn, but did not see V1 approaching. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and awareness of the oncoming traffic. As a result, V2 pulled out in front of V1, causing the collision.
