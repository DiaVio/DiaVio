The reason for this is that V2 was traveling south on the roadway and entered the intersection without yielding to V1, which was already in the intersection heading west. V2's failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, one possible associated factor for V2 was a sightline restriction due to parked vehicles on the side of the road, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to see V1 before entering the intersection.
