The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 turned left across the path of Vehicle 2, failing to yield the right of way. The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that he did not see the other vehicle due to sun glare and possible view obstruction caused by the roadway design (hillcrest). However, it is the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to do so, regardless of any environmental factors. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is considered primarily responsible for the crash.
