The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive to the driving task and violated a traffic control device (TCD). Additionally, the driver was upset about a recent death in the family, which may have further distracted them from the road. The fact that the rear tires of V1 had inadequate tread depth could have also contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle properly. On the other hand, V2 (the 1995 Isuzu Rodeo sport utility) was stopped and waiting to turn left at the intersection. The driver of V2 had been waiting for more than a minute for the light to change to green and proceeded on green. Therefore, V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattentiveness, violation of a traffic control device, and inadequate tread depth on the rear tires.
