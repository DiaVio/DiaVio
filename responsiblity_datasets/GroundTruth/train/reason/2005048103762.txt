The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was backing southbound in the northbound lane, which is a violation of traffic rules and regulations. - V1 attempted an "S" turn to reach a driveway, which indicates a poor decision-making process. - V1 was equipped with aftermarket tires that were larger than the manufacturer's recommended tire size and overinflated, which could have affected the vehicle's stability and handling. - The driver of V1 had a broken left hand at the time of the crash, which impaired his ability to steer the vehicle effectively. - The driver of V1 had consumed an unknown number of beers prior to the crash, indicating impaired judgment and potentially impaired driving abilities. Overall, V1's actions, including backing in the wrong lane, poor decision-making, vehicle modifications, physical impairment, and alcohol consumption, contribute to their primary responsibility for the crash.
