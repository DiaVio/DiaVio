The reason for this is that V1 was being driven by a 14-year-old male who was unlicensed and driving a stolen vehicle. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was that the vehicle was traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating poor directional control and driver inexperience. The associated factors also suggest that V1 was traveling too fast for conditions, further contributing to the accident.
