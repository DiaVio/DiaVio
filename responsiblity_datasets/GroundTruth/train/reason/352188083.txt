The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling in the wrong direction (eastbound in the westbound travel lanes) without activated headlamps. Additionally, it was reported that Vehicle 2 had been traveling in the wrong direction for some time and had prior impact damage. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 2 was not following traffic laws and was likely impaired or distracted, leading to the collision with Vehicle 1.
