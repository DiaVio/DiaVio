The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was unable to negotiate the left curve at the speed he was traveling and realized he would not be able to avoid the parked vehicle ahead. Despite attempting to brake, V1 slid into the rear of the parked vehicle, causing the collision. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to adjust his speed or take appropriate measures to avoid the collision.
