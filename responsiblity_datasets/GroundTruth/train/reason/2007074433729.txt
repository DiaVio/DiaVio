The reason for this is that V1 was changing lanes and failed to notice that V2 (the Dodge Ram pickup) was stopped in lane two. V1 admitted to looking left to ensure it was clear to make the lane change, but when she returned her attention forward, V2 was already stopped. This indicates that V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead and failed to anticipate the possibility of V2 stopping. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others - did not expect V2 to stop." This suggests that V1 was traveling at a speed that made it difficult for her to respond in time to the unexpected action of V2 stopping. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to observe the stopped vehicle and her inability to respond in a timely manner.
