The reason for this is that the driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the John Deere tractor) and failed to realize that V2 was in the same lane until just prior to impact. This misjudgment of the gap or other's speed is a driver-related factor and indicates that V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and the vehicles around them. Additionally, the driver of V1 made an "other" recognition error by initially thinking that V2 was in the opposing lane of travel. This further suggests a lack of awareness and attentiveness on the part of V1. On the other hand, V2's critical reason for the crash was not coded, indicating that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. While an associated factor of an "other" decision error was coded for V2 for driving a farm tractor under speed on a dark roadway, this alone does not make V2 primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their misjudgment of the gap or other's speed and lack of awareness.
