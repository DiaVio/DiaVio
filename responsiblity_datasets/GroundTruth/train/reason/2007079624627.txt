The driver of V1 was attempting a left turn and failed to see V2 (the 1984 Plymouth Reliant) until just before impact. The driver of V1 was distracted by looking at pedestrians at the northwest corner of the intersection, which caused her to not notice V2 encroaching from the opposite direction. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and the driver's external distraction are the main reasons for the collision.
