The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as he had consumed alcoholic drinks prior to the crash. This impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely and make appropriate decisions on the road. Additionally, the driver was driving approximately 24 kmph (15 mph) over the designated speed limit, which further contributed to the severity of the accident. Furthermore, the driver's inattention due to the argument the passenger was having on the phone may have distracted him from focusing on the road and maintaining control of the vehicle. Although the passenger grabbed the wheel and caused the initial swerve, it was ultimately the driver's responsibility to react appropriately and regain control of the vehicle, which he failed to do. Therefore, V1 (the driver) is primarily responsible for the accident due to driving under the influence, speeding, and failing to maintain control of the vehicle despite the passenger's interference.
