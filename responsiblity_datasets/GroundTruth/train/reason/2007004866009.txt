The driver of V1 admitted to making an illegal maneuver by attempting to turn left into the driveway. Although the driver claimed that northbound traffic stopped and "waved" her through, it is still her responsibility to ensure that it is safe to make the turn. V1 failed to see the approaching V2 and was struck on the right side. V1 also made no avoidance maneuver, indicating a lack of awareness and attentiveness. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and failure to exercise caution make them primarily responsible for the accident.
