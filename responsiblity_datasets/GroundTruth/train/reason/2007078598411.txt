The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was intoxicated with a blood alcohol level of 0.30, which is significantly above the legal limit. The driver admitted to consuming alcohol before driving and stated that he "blacked out" while driving, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. This impaired state directly led to the vehicle crossing the sidewalk, striking a fence, and ultimately crashing into a building. The driver's impaired condition and inability to operate the vehicle safely make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
