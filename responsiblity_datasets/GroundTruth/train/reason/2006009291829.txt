The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not notice V2 approaching from the rear in lane one. This failure to properly observe the surrounding traffic and merge safely into lane one led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by the previous accident ahead and the presence of a police officer directing traffic, which further contributed to the lack of attention and awareness on the road. Therefore, V1's failure to properly merge and maintain awareness of the surrounding traffic, combined with the external distractions, makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
