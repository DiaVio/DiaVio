The reason for this is that the case vehicle (V1) was traveling in its designated lane and crossing through the intersection, while V2 was in the left-turn lane and entered the path of V1. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the frontal impact and under-riding of the bus by V1.
