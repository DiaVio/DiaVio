The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was following too closely to respond to the unexpected actions of other road users, which resulted in the collision with the rear of Vehicle two (V2). Additionally, the driver of V1 misjudged the speed and gap distance between his vehicle and V2. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not maintaining a safe distance and was traveling too fast to respond to the traffic conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and their inability to respond to the actions of other vehicles on the road.
