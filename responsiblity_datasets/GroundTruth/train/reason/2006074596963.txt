The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was reaching down to retrieve papers that had fallen onto the floor right before the crash. This action indicates a distraction on the part of the driver, which likely contributed to their failure to notice that Vehicle 2 had slowed down and steered to the right to avoid Vehicle 3. As a result, Vehicle 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle 2, initiating the chain reaction of collisions involving Vehicles 1, 3, and 4. While Vehicle 3 (the 2000 Chevrolet Blazer) did stop in the second lane to avoid a crash that occurred ahead of Vehicle 1, this action was a reasonable response to the situation and does not absolve Vehicle 1 of responsibility for the subsequent collision. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
