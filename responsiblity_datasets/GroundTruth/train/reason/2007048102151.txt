The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a blowout and partial tread separation of the left rear tire. This tire failure was identified as the critical pre-crash event and the critical reason for the crash. The driver's poor directional control, failing to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, was also noted as an associated factor in the crash.
