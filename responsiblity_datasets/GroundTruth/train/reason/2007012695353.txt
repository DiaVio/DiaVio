The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that he did not stop to look before entering the intersection, and there was a sight restriction in the form of a non-contact vehicle stopped in the opposing lane. This lack of proper surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way resulted in the collision with V2.
