The driver of V2 made an illegal right turn from the wrong travel lane (lane two) into the apartment complex driveway, crossing over lane one where V1 was traveling. V2 failed to adequately surveil the area and did not see the motorcycle (V1) before making the turn. This illegal maneuver and inadequate surveillance by the driver of V2 caused V1 to lay down his bike prior to impact with V2.
