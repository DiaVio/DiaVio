The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes into lane four without adequately surveilling the traffic conditions ahead. The driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 (the 2004 Chevrolet 1500 pickup) was stopped, resulting in the front of V1 colliding with the back of V2. This initial collision then caused the front of V2 to strike the back of V3 (the 2006 Nissan Xterra). Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to react appropriately to the stopped vehicle ahead led to the chain of events that caused the crash.
