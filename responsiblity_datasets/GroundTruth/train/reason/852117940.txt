The reason for this is that V1 rear-ended Vehicle Two (V2), the 1987 Ford Aerostar van, while it was stopped in lane two to make a left turn. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the back of V2. Additionally, after the initial impact, V1 continued down the steep graded street, drifting gradually to the right and eventually departing off the roadway, resulting in further damage to V1 and other objects. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and control of the vehicle, leading to the rear-end collision and subsequent damage, makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
