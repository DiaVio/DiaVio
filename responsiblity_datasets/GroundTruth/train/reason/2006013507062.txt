The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the line of cars in front of it and struck the rear of V1. The driver of V2 stated that he was traveling at a high speed and failed to recognize the stopped vehicles in front of him in a timely manner. This recognition error, along with factors such as the wet road conditions, the driver's inexperience, and the long duration of his drive, likely contributed to the crash.
