The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn. The driver stated that he did not see V2 approaching, which indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of other vehicles on the road. This failure to exercise caution and ensure a safe turn resulted in the collision with V2.
