The reason for V1's primary responsibility is due to several factors. Firstly, the driver of V1 was driving under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol level of .25. This impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle and make appropriate driving decisions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, having not slept in 19 hours. Fatigue can significantly impact a driver's alertness and reaction time, making them more prone to errors and poor judgment. Furthermore, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted, possibly due to changing the radio station. Internal distractions can divert a driver's attention away from the road, increasing the risk of veering into another lane. Lastly, V1 had poor directional control, as evidenced by the fact that the vehicle veered into the lane of V2 without any apparent attempt at avoidance actions. Overall, the combination of driving under the influence, fatigue, distraction, and poor directional control makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
