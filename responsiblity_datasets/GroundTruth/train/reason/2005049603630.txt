The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn from the second lane of travel at the intersection, crossing into the path of V2 (the driver of the Lexus LS 430) who was traveling straight through the intersection. V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle within the appropriate lane and crossed into the lane where V2 was traveling. Additionally, V1 made the left turn without the protected left turn arrow, which is an illegal maneuver.
