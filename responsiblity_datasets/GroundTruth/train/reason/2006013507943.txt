The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop behind V1 at the intersection, resulting in a collision with the left rear corner of V1. V2 then crossed into the southbound travel lane and collided with V3. The driver of V2 admitted to a recognition error of inattention and inadequate surveillance, indicating a failure to pay attention to the road and look far enough ahead. Therefore, V2's failure to stop and their recognition error of inattention make them primarily responsible for the crash.
