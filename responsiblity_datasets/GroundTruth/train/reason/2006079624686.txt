The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 1990 Ford Escort). V1 stated that she never saw V2's approach before the impact, indicating a driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, V2 reported that she did not see V1 until after it had turned into her path. However, V2's critical precrash event was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment, from driveway, turning into opposite direction," suggesting that V2 was not primarily responsible for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance while making a left turn at the intersection.
