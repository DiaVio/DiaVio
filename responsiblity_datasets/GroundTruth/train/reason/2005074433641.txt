The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the left lane, causing the collision with V1. V1 had the right of way and was in the process of making a left turn after stopping and ensuring that the southbound traffic had lightened up. V2's encroachment into the left lane obstructed V1's view and resulted in the collision.
