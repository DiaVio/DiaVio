The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and began to turn left across the path of the northbound Honda (Vehicle 2). The frontal area of Vehicle 1 impacted the front left area of Vehicle 2, resulting in moderate damage. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, causing the collision.
