The reason for this is that V1 drifted over the left lane line and entered the opposing lane, causing the collision with V2 (the 2001 Ford F-150). V1's driver attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering right, but was unable to prevent the impact. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain its lane and control of the vehicle led to the accident.
