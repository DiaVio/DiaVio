The reason for this is that V3 made a right turn in front of V2, causing V2 to collide with the left rear of V3. This initial impact then caused V2 to travel in a northeast direction and collide with the front of V1. Therefore, V3's failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic resulted in the chain of events that led to the accident.
