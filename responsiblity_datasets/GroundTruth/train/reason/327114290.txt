The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, crossed the center line, and ultimately collided with a tree off the west shoulder of the road. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the proper lane suggests negligence or error on their part, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
