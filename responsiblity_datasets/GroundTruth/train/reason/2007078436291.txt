The driver of V1 made a U-turn from the east shoulder of the road without adequately surveilling the traffic. This means that the driver failed to properly look or failed to see the oncoming vehicle, V2 (the 1995 Dodge Neon), which was traveling southbound in lane one. As a result, V2 collided with the right side of V1. Although V2 skidded longitudinally and encroached over the left lane line, this action was in response to V1's sudden U-turn and can be considered a reaction to V1's inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V2's actions can be seen as a secondary consequence of V1's primary error. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to properly surveil the traffic before making a U-turn.
