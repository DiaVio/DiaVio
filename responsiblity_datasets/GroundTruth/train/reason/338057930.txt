The reason for this is that the driver of V1 abruptly changed lanes to the left in avoidance of a slower non-contact vehicle ahead. This steering maneuver caused V1 to veer towards the left shoulder and into the center median, ultimately resulting in the collision with the large diameter tree (Event 1) and subsequent secondary impact with another tree (Event 2). The actions of the driver of V1 led to the sequence of events that caused the accident.
