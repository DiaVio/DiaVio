The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the high beams of an oncoming vehicle, which caused her to lose sight of the road. This distraction led to V1 drifting off the roadway and ultimately crashing into various objects. Despite being familiar with the roadway and having no health or fatigue issues, the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and take evasive actions to avoid the crash.
