The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 crossed over into the oncoming lane, striking the front left corner of Vehicle #2 (the 1997 Nissan Altima). The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted, looking down at the fuel gauge and tapping the instrument panel with his left hand at the time of the crash. He also stated that he never saw the other vehicle. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the Critical Reason for this event was internal distraction. The driver's admission of not seeing the other vehicle further supports the conclusion that Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
