The driver of Vehicle V1 failed to navigate the right curve on the transition ramp and allowed the vehicle to travel off the left side of the roadway. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, the driver's decision to steer left when encountering the loose gravel berm caused the vehicle to trip and overturn, resulting in the accident.
