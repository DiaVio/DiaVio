The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection, disregarding the traffic control device. This illegal maneuver resulted in V1 colliding with the right side of V2. Although V2 also had a sightline restriction, it does not absolve V1 of responsibility as V1 had the obligation to stop and yield the right of way.
