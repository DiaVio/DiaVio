The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 made a left turn while Vehicle 2 (a 1999 Sterling van body straight-truck) was approaching the intersection. Vehicle 1 struck the left side of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
