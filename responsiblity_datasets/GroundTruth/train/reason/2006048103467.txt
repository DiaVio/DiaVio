The reason for this is that the semi truck changed lanes into V1's travel lane, causing V1 to take evasive action to avoid a collision. V1 locked its brakes and steered right, resulting in a loss of control and ultimately causing the crash. Therefore, the actions of V2 in changing lanes without ensuring it was clear and safe to do so led to the chain of events that resulted in the crash.
