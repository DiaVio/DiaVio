The reason for this is that V1 was the only vehicle involved in the crash and it departed the roadway, sliding laterally into a sign post and a large tree, before rotating back onto the roadway and ultimately impacting a guard rail. The driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
