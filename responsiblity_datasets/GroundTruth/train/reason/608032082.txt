The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle lost control while negotiating a right-sweeping curve. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the subsequent skid and rollover. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a lap and shoulder belt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
