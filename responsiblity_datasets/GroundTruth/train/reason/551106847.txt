The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the left from the traveled lane and drove off the roadway, striking various objects and the embankments of the ditch. V1 impacted a phone box, a landscaped wall, tree limbs, and a sign post before finally coming to rest partially on the westbound lane. The driver and front seat occupants of V1 were also injured in the accident.
