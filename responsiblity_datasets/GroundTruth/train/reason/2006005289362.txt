The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 took incorrect evasive action by over-steering when trying to avoid the deer that entered the roadway. This resulted in V1 departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, having only been driving for less than a year, which may have contributed to the incorrect evasive action taken. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and lack of experience.
