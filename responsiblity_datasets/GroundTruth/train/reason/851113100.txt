The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that lost control and crossed over into the opposite lane, ultimately departing the roadway and colliding with various objects. The driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve, resulting in the counterclockwise rotation and subsequent impact with the tree, stump, and boulder. The major intrusion and lateral force direction indicate that V1 was the vehicle that caused the most significant damage and injury.
