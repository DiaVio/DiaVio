The critical-pre crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason was coded as a driver-related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see V1 crossing through, resulting in the collision.
