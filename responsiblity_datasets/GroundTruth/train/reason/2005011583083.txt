The driver of V1 admitted to changing lanes partially into lane 1 and then returning to lane 2, while another vehicle was passing by. This sudden lane change likely caught V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) off guard, causing V2 to slow down and be struck from behind by V1. This initial impact then caused V2 to lose control and collide with V3 (the driver of the Ford Focus). V1's decision error and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed led to the chain of events that resulted in the crash. Additionally, V1 was cited for failing to maintain an Assured Clear Distance, indicating that they did not maintain a safe following distance from V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their lane change and failure to maintain a safe distance.
