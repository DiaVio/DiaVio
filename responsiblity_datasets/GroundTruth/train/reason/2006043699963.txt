The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 16-year old female, failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding to make a left turn. The critical reason for the accident was determined to be "inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see)". Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the area and had only traveled on this road a few times previously. These factors contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
