The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to pass an uninvolved vehicle, which indicates that V1 was making a maneuver that could potentially lead to a collision. The front of V1 made contact with the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2005 Ford Explorer, suggesting that V1 was at fault for initiating the collision.
