The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road and did not anticipate the abrupt lane closure. This is evident from the driver's statement that she saw the flashing arrow sign warning drivers to merge but did not expect that lane one would be blocked so abruptly prior to the sign. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) in a work zone, which is considered too fast. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, failure to anticipate the lane closure, and traveling too fast in a work zone.
