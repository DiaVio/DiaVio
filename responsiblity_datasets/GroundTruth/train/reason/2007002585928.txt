The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel due to self-proclaimed sleep deprivation. Falling asleep while driving is a driver non-performance error and a clear violation of safe driving practices. The driver's fatigue likely impaired their ability to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 crossing into the westbound lane, going off the roadway, and ultimately crashing into various objects before coming to a stop.
