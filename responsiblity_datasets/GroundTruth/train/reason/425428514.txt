The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 crossed the center line at the peak of the hillcrest and struck the front of Vehicle 1 (2009 Acura TSX) in a small overlap configuration (Event 1). This initial impact caused Vehicle 1 to rotate counterclockwise and travel into the oncoming lane of travel. Subsequently, the front of Vehicle 3 (2009 Dodge Ram 1500 large pickup) impacted the right plane of Vehicle 1 (Event 2). Therefore, Vehicle 2's crossing of the center line and initial impact with Vehicle 1 set off the chain of events that led to the subsequent impact with Vehicle 3.
