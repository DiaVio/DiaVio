The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to change lanes into the second lane without ensuring that it was clear. This action led to a conflict with the non-contacted semi/tractor-trailer, which was also changing lanes at the same time. V1's decision to steer left and fully apply the brakes in response to the semi's movement caused the vehicle to lose control and slide across multiple lanes before colliding with the guardrail and rolling over. Additionally, the weather conditions (rain and wet roadway) were mentioned as an associated factor in the crash. While these conditions may have contributed to the overall difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly assessing the situation and making a safe lane change.
