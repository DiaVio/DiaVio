The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 changed lanes and struck the back plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2013 Honda Civic 4-door sedan) for unknown reasons. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to maintain proper control and collided with the vehicle ahead of it, causing both vehicles to lose control and come to an uncontrolled stop.
