The driver of V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance and failed to look or see V2 approaching before entering the intersection. The driver was inattentive due to thinking about financial problems and also ignored the stop sign. If the driver had stopped at the stop sign, they may have detected V2 before entering the intersection. Therefore, V1's actions and negligence in not properly observing the traffic and disregarding the stop sign contributed to the accident.
