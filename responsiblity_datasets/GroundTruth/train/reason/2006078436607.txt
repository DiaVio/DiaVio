The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the cross street. This action violated the traffic rules and regulations, leading to the collision with the directional sign and the subsequent crash into the barbed wire fence. The driver's claim of brake failure was not supported by the post-crash inspection, which found the brake pedal pressure to be firm. Therefore, the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and control the vehicle properly is the main factor contributing to the crash.
