The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 swerved to avoid a deer in the roadway but lost control of the vehicle, resulting in a counterclockwise rotation and subsequent collision with Vehicle 2 (V2). This loss of control and subsequent collision caused damage to both vehicles and resulted in V1 tripping and rolling over multiple times before coming to a final rest.
