The driver of V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before proceeding. This is evident from the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V2, which states that the driver looked but did not see the oncoming Vehicle 1 (V1). The driver of V2 admitted that the crash could have been avoided if she had seen V1 sooner. Additionally, V2 was the vehicle that was struck on its right side, indicating that V2 was turning across the path of V1.
