The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as an illegal maneuver, indicating that V1 was crossing over or passing through the intersection in an unlawful manner. Additionally, an associated factor coded to V1 was a sightline restriction due to shrubbery on the side of the road, which likely blocked V1's view of V2 until V2 entered the intersection. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and limited visibility due to shrubbery contributed to the collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
