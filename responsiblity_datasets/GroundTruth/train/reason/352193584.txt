The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 lost control and departed the roadway, entering the grass median and striking Vehicle 3. This initial loss of control by Vehicle 2 set off a chain reaction, causing Vehicle 3 to be pushed into Vehicle 4 and ultimately resulting in the collision with Vehicle 1. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 initiated the sequence of events leading to the collision.
