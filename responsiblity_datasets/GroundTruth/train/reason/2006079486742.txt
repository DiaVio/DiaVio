The reason for this is that V1 made a driver-related decision error by misjudging the gap or the speed of V2 (the 1995 Honda Civic). V1 reported that she observed V2 approaching from the left and believed that there was sufficient space for her to make the left turn safely. However, she failed to accurately assess the speed and distance of V2, resulting in her pulling out in front of V2 and causing the collision.
