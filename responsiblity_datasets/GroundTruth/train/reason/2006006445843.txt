The driver of V1 fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event coded to V1 suggests that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a potential lane violation. However, due to the lack of interview, the specific driver error is unknown. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in their designated lane when they were lightly struck by V1. This impact caused V2 to lose control and collide with the concrete divider and barrier. While the driver of V2 seemed disoriented and exhibited unusual behavior, there is no evidence to suggest that their actions contributed significantly to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their hit-and-run behavior and potential lane violation.
