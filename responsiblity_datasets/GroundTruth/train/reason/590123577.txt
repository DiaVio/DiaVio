The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that it merged left into the eastbound number-one lane just as V1 (the Case Vehicle) was changing lanes to the right. This resulted in a minor impact between the front right of V1 and the back left of V2. However, this minor impact caused V1 to initiate a left-right steering maneuver, leading to a clockwise yaw and ultimately causing V1 to overturn and sustain serious injury to the driver. Therefore, V2's decision to merge left at the same time as V1 was changing lanes contributed to the sequence of events that led to the accident, making V2 primarily responsible.
