The driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 was stopped at the bottom of the on-ramp, due to being distracted by traffic on the roadway. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that they thought V2 had already merged into traffic, showing a lack of attention and awareness of their surroundings. Although the driver of V1 mentioned feeling fatigued due to only having 2 hours of sleep the night before, this does not excuse their failure to properly observe and react to the situation. Fatigue can impair judgment and reaction time, making it even more important for drivers to be vigilant and attentive. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was stopped at the bottom of the ramp, waiting to merge into traffic as required by the yield sign. They were not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to recognize and react to the presence of a stopped vehicle in front of them.
