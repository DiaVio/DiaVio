The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a recognition error and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. This is evident from the fact that V1 stated he did not see the northbound vehicle until after he had started his turn and that the vehicle was too close for him to take any avoidance actions. Additionally, there are several factors associated with V1 that contribute to his responsibility. These include the driver's fatigue from making two long road trips, the unknown medication he was taking, and the possibility of his sleep apnea condition affecting his driving ability. It is important to note that V2 (the 19-year-old female driving the 1997 Chevrolet Lumina) also had a contributing factor of being on medication for depression, which may have affected her ability to react to the driving situation. However, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and make a safe left turn is the primary cause of the accident.
