The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it lost control and departed the lane and roadway to the left. This resulted in the front left corner of V1 impacting the concrete barrier, causing it to lift upward and initiate the rollover. The subsequent rollover and sliding on its roof top in lane two indicate that V1 was not able to maintain control and stability on the wet roadway.
