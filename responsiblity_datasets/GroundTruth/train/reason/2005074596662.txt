The critical pre-crash event for V2 was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was coded as external distraction. The driver stated that he was watching other traffic and did not see V1 (the Honda Accord) approaching. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
