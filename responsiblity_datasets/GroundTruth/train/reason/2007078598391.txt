The driver of V1 was making a U-turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Nissan X-Terra) without properly checking for oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 because she was looking at her intended travel lane to the left. This indicates a failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making the U-turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver by making a U-turn at that location. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
