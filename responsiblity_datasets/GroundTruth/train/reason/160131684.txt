The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway and struck the embankment and guardrail multiple times before coming to rest in the median. The driver of V1 was also transported to the hospital for treatment, indicating that they were likely at fault for losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, the passenger in V1 was not injured, suggesting that the impact was primarily caused by the actions of the driver of V1.
