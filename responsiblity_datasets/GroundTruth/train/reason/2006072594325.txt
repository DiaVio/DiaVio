The reason for this is that V1 was reported to be traveling at an excessive speed, which indicates that the driver was not adhering to the speed limit. Additionally, V1 rear-ended V2 (the 2000 Lincoln Navigator), suggesting that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to recognize the deceleration of the vehicle ahead (V2) are the main factors contributing to the crash.
