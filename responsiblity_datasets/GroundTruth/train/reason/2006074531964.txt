The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was distracted by adjusting the air conditioning controls, which was identified as a driver-related factor. This distraction likely caused the driver to fail to yield the right of way to Vehicle two, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two (the 2001 Ford Expedition) was not found to have any contributing factors that would make them primarily responsible for the accident. They were simply traveling on the northbound lane and did not see the other vehicle. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's internal distraction while adjusting the air conditioning controls.
