The reason for this is that V1 failed to negotiate a gradual left curve on the highway, resulting in it departing the roadway to the right. V1 then crossed over both southbound and northbound lanes before rotating clockwise and ultimately rolling over to the left. This indicates a loss of control by the driver of V1, leading to the accident.
