The reason for V1's responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for conditions - congested traffic." This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed that was not appropriate for the congested traffic situation. Additionally, V1's statement that she "blacked out" prior to the crash suggests a lack of control over her vehicle, further supporting her responsibility for the accident.
