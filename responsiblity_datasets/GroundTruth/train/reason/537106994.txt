The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize that Vehicle two (V2), the 1995 Ford F250, was stopped ahead, resulting in V1 colliding with and underriding the rear of V2. This failure to recognize the stopped vehicle indicates a lack of attention or awareness on the part of the driver of V1, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
