Reason: 1. V1 was an unlicensed driver who had never been on the road before, indicating a lack of experience and knowledge of traffic rules. 2. V1 reported being distracted by a vehicle behind her with high beams on, which may have impaired her visibility and attention. 3. V1 admitted to smoking while driving and showed signs of fatigue, indicating potential impairment of her driving abilities. 4. V1 failed to recognize the presence of V2, which was double-parked and unoccupied, indicating a driver recognition error and inadequate surveillance. 5. V1 made no avoidance actions, suggesting a lack of attentiveness and response to the situation. While V2 was illegally double-parked, it is important to note that V1's actions and factors such as inexperience, distraction, fatigue, and failure to recognize the presence of V2 were the primary contributing factors to the accident.
