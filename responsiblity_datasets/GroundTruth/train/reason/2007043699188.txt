The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 encroached over the left lane line, causing the collision with V1 (the 1999 Chevrolet S10). This encroachment from the opposite direction was the critical pre-crash event for V2. No critical reason was coded to V2, indicating that there were no other associated factors contributing to the driver's actions. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's encroachment into the left lane, resulting in the collision with V1.
