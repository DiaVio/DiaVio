The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop prior to entering the intersection and did not detect V1 until impact. Additionally, the driver of V2 failed to look far enough ahead to notice V1, indicating inadequate surveillance. These factors suggest that V2 was not exercising proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
