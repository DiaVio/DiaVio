The reason for this is that V2 was facing south in a business driveway, waiting to turn right and go west. As V1 (the 2003 Dodge Durango SUV) approached the intersection, V2 turned right into the path of V1. V1 was unable to perform any steering avoidance maneuvers due to parked vehicles on the right side of the travel lane and a witness vehicle on the left side of the travel lane. V1 was only able to brake after the collision occurred. Therefore, V2's action of turning right into the path of V1 without yielding or giving V1 enough time to react is the primary cause of the collision.
