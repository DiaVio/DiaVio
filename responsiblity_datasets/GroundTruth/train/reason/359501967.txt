The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, crossed over the paved shoulder, and had a minor impact with a metal marker post. V1 then continued down the snow-covered slope and impacted a large utility pole, which was the highest delta V event. V1 further had impacts with a series of trees, causing rotation and damage to multiple trees. The final rest position of V1 was facing east. Therefore, based on the sequence of events described, it can be concluded that V1 was the vehicle primarily responsible for the accident.
