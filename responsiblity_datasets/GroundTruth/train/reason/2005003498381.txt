The driver of Vehicle # 2 stated that Vehicle # 1 did not stop at the stop sign, but stopped in the middle of the intersection. However, the critical reason for the critical event of Vehicle # 2 was not coded to the driver, indicating that the driver of Vehicle # 2 may have been traveling too fast for the conditions and failed to realize that caution was necessary. Additionally, the atmospheric conditions were cloudy and raining, and the roads were wet, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time and avoid the collision.
