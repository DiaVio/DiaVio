The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver admitted to knowing that the roadway was icy and was traveling at a speed of 89 kmph (55 mph), which exceeds the speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). Additionally, the driver's attempt to regain control of the vehicle by steering left and right suggests a lack of proper control and skill in handling the vehicle under the given conditions. Therefore, V1's primary responsibility lies with the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the icy road conditions, resulting in a loss of control and the subsequent crash.
