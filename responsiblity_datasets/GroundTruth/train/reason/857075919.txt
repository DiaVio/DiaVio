The driver of Vehicle 1 drifted off the left side of the roadway and into the median while traveling east. This resulted in Vehicle 1 descending the grass embankment and colliding with a tree in the wooded tree line. The impact was fairly centered across the frontal plane, indicating little or no rotation. Since no other vehicles were involved in the crash and there were no physical viewing restrictions or defects on the road, the driver of Vehicle 1's actions of drifting off the road and failing to maintain control of the vehicle are the primary factors leading to the accident.
