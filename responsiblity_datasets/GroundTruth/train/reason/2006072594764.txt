The driver of V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead due to conversing with his two passengers. As a result, he failed to notice the stopped traffic in time to bring his vehicle to a safe stop, leading to the collision with the back of V2 (the 2002 Honda CRV SUV) and subsequently causing the collision between the front of V2 and the back of V3 (the 2003 Mitsubishi Galant 4-door).
