The driver of V1 was distracted by the non-contact vehicle merging into her lane and turned her head to locate it, taking her attention away from the road. This external distraction caused her to steer left and exit the roadway into the median. Additionally, her overcompensation and poor directional control led to a counterclockwise yaw and crossing back across both lanes, ultimately resulting in the vehicle overturning. Therefore, V1's driver's actions and lack of control were the main contributing factors to the crash.
