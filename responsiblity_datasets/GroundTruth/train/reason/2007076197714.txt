The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was the vehicle involved in the crash and it lost control, rotating counterclockwise and rolling over into the ditch. - The driver of V1 was found to have acute hydrocodone intoxication, which may have impaired her ability to control the vehicle. - Witnesses reported that V1 appeared to overcompensate, leading to the control loss. - There is no mention of any external factors or involvement of another vehicle (V2) in the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
