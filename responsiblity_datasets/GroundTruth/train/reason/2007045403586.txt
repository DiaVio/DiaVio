The driver of V1 made a false assumption that V2 would yield the right of way before making the right turn. Despite having his turn signals on and observing V2 in his rearview mirror, the driver of V1 incorrectly assumed that V2 would not pass him. This false assumption led to V1 initiating the right turn from the wrong lane, causing V2 to collide with the side of V1. Therefore, V1's false assumption and incorrect lane usage make them primarily responsible for the accident.
