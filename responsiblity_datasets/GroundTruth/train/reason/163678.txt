The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep while driving, which resulted in the vehicle running off the road and ultimately colliding with the guardrail and bridge rail. The driver's lack of attention and falling asleep behind the wheel led to the loss of control and subsequent accident.
