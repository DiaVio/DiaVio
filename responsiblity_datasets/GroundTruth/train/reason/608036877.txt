The reason for this is that the case vehicle drifted across the center line into the path of V2, causing V2 to take evasive action to avoid a collision. The driver of the case vehicle also steered to the right to re-enter the northbound lane at the same time, resulting in the front of the case vehicle striking the front of V2 in an off-set to the right frontal mode. This indicates that the case vehicle initiated the sequence of events that led to the collision.
