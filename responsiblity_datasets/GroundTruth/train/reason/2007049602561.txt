The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to exercise proper control of the vehicle, resulting in poor directional control. This is evident from the fact that V1 entered the intersection, immediately entered the median, crossed multiple lanes of traffic, and ultimately crashed into a fence and tree. Additionally, the driver admitted to not looking to his right (west) and failing to notice the approaching vehicle earlier. Therefore, V1's lack of skill in controlling the vehicle and failure to observe the approaching vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
