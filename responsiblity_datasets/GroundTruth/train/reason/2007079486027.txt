The reason for this is that the driver of V1, an 89-year-old female, had poor directional control of the vehicle, causing it to depart from the roadway and impact the wall of a building. The driver inadvertently put her foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, which led to the loss of control. This driver-related factor indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
