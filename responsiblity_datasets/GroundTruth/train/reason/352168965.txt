The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 65-year old male driver, struck and under rode the rear plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2007 Hino Model 268 straight truck). It is mentioned that Vehicle 2 had slowed down, possibly due to traffic congestion or a traffic signal/intersection, and Vehicle 1 failed to maintain a safe distance or react appropriately to the slowing vehicle. This resulted in the frontal impact between the two vehicles. Additionally, it is noted that Vehicle 1's seat belt pretensioners actuated the frontal airbags and side curtains, indicating that the impact was significant. This suggests that Vehicle 1 was likely traveling at a speed that was too fast for the conditions or failed to brake in a timely manner to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
