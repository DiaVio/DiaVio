The reason for this is that V1, the Ford Ranger pickup, was stopped at a red light and intended to turn left. However, V1 turned in front of V2, the Hyundai Elantra sedan, which was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2.
