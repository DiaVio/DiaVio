The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 displayed poor directional control, as indicated by their inability to navigate the "S" curve properly. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a speed of 45-50 MPH on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 30 MPH, indicating that they were traveling too fast for the conditions. Furthermore, the driver's aggressive driving behavior, by knowingly exceeding the speed limit on a road they were familiar with, contributed to the crash. Lastly, the driver's inadequate and incorrect evasive action, such as braking and steering too hard, further exacerbated the situation. Overall, the driver of Vehicle 1 demonstrated a lack of experience, poor judgment, and failure to adapt to the road conditions, making them primarily responsible for the crash.
