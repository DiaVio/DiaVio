The reason for this is that the driver's actions directly led to the sequence of events that resulted in the accident. She experienced sudden anxiety, causing her hands to shake, and in her attempt to apply the brake to release the cruise control, she accidentally hit the gas pedal instead. This caused the vehicle to accelerate, which further alarmed her. As she tried to reposition her legs, she inadvertently bumped the steering rim, causing the vehicle to veer into the adjacent lane. She then steered left and applied the brakes quickly, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw that led to the vehicle colliding with the guardrail. Therefore, the driver's actions and lack of control over the vehicle make her primarily responsible for the accident.
