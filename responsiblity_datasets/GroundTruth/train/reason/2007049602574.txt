The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is a clear indication of driver negligence. The driver's lack of sleep, due to working extended hours for several weeks without a day off, likely contributed to his drowsiness and inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Falling asleep while driving is a serious violation of traffic laws and poses a significant risk to both the driver and other road users.
