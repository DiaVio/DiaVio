The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by her dog, causing her to look away from the roadway. This distraction led to V1 drifting off the right road edge and ultimately colliding with the guard rail. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of 105 kmph (65 mph) indicates that V1 was exceeding the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph) and the advisory speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph) for the curve. Therefore, V1's driver's distraction and excessive speed are the primary factors contributing to the accident.
