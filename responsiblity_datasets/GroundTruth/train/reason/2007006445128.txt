The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes and made contact with V2 (the Chevy Astro van) while V2 was slowing down to make a right turn. V1's attempt to brake, as indicated by skid marks on the roadway, suggests that V1 was not able to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, it was reported that the driver of V1 was talking on a cell phone at the time of the crash, indicating a distraction that may have contributed to the accident.
