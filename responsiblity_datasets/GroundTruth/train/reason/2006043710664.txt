The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 reported that he looked but did not see any approaching vehicles before making his left turn. This indicates a failure to properly observe the intersection and assess the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned being distracted by having his radio on and being upset about the long wait time at the restaurant he initially intended to go to. These factors may have contributed to his lack of attention and inadequate surveillance. While V2 (the driver of the Jeep Grand Cherokee) also had associated factors such as assuming that V1 would yield the right of way and being in a hurry, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to properly observe the intersection and make a safe left turn.
