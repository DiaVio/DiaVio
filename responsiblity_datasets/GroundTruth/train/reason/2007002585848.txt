The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 entered the roadway across the driving lane and stopped partially into the passing lane, obstructing the path of oncoming traffic. V1 made a false assumption that the other driver would yield the right of way, despite not having a clear view of the oncoming traffic due to the curve in the road. This action of V1 turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view and assuming the other driver would stop and let him cross led to the collision with V2.
