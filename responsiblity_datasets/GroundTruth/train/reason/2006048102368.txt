The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to adequately observe the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," and the critical reason for this event was "not coded to this vehicle." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while crossing the intersection.
