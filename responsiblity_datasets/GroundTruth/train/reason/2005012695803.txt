The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver did not see the pedestrian walking into the roadway, and as a result, the vehicle made contact with the pedestrian. It is the responsibility of the driver to be aware of their surroundings and exercise caution to avoid collisions with pedestrians. In this case, the driver of V1 failed to see the pedestrian, indicating a lack of attention or awareness, which ultimately led to the accident.
