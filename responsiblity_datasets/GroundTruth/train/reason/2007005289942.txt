The driver of V1 proceeded through the intersection without ensuring sufficient clearance, which is indicated by the coded critical reason of "inadequate surveillance - looked but did not see." This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before entering the intersection. Additionally, the associated factor of "proceeding with insufficient clearance" further supports the driver's failure to ensure a safe crossing. While the driver of V2 (the 2005 Acura TL) attempted to avoid the collision by steering to the right, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as they failed to exercise proper caution and yield the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash due to inadequate surveillance and proceeding with insufficient clearance.
