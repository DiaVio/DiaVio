The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking both right and left, the driver did not see V2 (1992 Pontiac Transport) approaching and pulled into its path. This indicates a lack of proper judgment and awareness on the part of V1's driver, leading to the collision. Additionally, the driver's use of anxiety medication, which can affect driving abilities and judgment, may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance.
