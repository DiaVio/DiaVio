The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that their vehicle lost control and crossed into the westbound lane, colliding with V2 (the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer). The investigation revealed that V1's rear tires began to slide on the slick roadway, indicating that the driver was not able to maintain control of the vehicle in the snowy conditions. Additionally, the vehicle inspection revealed that all four tires were underinflated with low tread depth, further contributing to the lack of control. While the driver of V2 may have encroached slightly over the left lane line, it is important to note that V1's loss of control and subsequent crossing into the opposite lane was the critical pre-crash event that directly led to the collision. Therefore, V1 bears primary responsibility for the accident.
