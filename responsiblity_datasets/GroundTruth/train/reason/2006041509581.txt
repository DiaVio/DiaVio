The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of his vehicle while attempting to change lanes. This loss of control resulted in V1 colliding with the concrete barrier wall and subsequently rolling over multiple times. The driver's statement indicates that he was traveling at a high speed of approximately 128 kmph (80 mph) and was frequently changing lanes. Additionally, the driver admitted to not adequately checking his blind spot before attempting the lane change, which suggests inadequate surveillance. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, including speeding and frequent lane changes, coupled with being in a hurry due to his wife being late for work, likely contributed to his decision to attempt the lane change without proper observation. These factors, along with work-related stress and conversation, further support V1's primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's loss of control while attempting to change lanes, which was influenced by aggressive driving, inadequate surveillance, and other associated factors.
