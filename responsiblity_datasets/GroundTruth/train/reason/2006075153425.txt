The driver of V1 stated that he applied the brakes when he realized that traffic in front of him was stopping. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This suggests that the driver of V1 did not exercise proper surveillance and failed to notice the stopped vehicles in front of him, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance.
