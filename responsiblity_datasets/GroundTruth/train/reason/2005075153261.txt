The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. In this case, V3 began to slow down due to large truck tire debris in the road from a blowout ahead of it. V2, being behind V3, also began to slow down. However, V1 was not able to slow down in time and its front impacted the rear of V2, causing a chain reaction that resulted in V2's front impacting the rear of V3. By not maintaining a safe following distance and being unable to respond to the slowing vehicles ahead, V1 demonstrated a lack of attentiveness and caution, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
