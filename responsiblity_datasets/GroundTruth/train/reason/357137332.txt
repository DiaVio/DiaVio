The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north-northwest in the outside through lane of the intersecting six-lane road, while the case vehicle, a Toyota Camry, was in the outside eastbound lane of the four-lane road approaching the intersection. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, V2 crossed its path and struck the right-rear door and quarter-panel of the case vehicle. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to the case vehicle, resulting in the collision.
