The reason for this is that V1 was driving too fast for the icy road conditions, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle immediately after turning onto the roadway. Additionally, the poor condition of the tires (under-inflated right side tires and a left rear tire with no tread) contributed to the lack of control and stability of the vehicle. It is important for drivers to adjust their speed according to the road conditions and ensure that their vehicle is properly maintained, including having adequate tire tread and inflation. In this case, V1's failure to do so resulted in the accident.
