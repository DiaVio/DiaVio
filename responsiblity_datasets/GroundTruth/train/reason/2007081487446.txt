The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the northbound lane when a non-contact vehicle began to change lanes into the lane that V1 was traveling in. Instead of maintaining control and avoiding the non-contact vehicle safely, the driver of V1 hit the brakes and overcorrected, causing the vehicle to rotate counter-clockwise and ultimately collide with the left-side concrete barrier. The driver's incorrect evasive action, overcompensation, and poor directional control were the contributing factors to the accident.
