The driver of V1 attempted to merge into the first lane without properly checking her blind spot, which resulted in her losing control of the vehicle. Her inadequate surveillance and failure to look properly before changing lanes were the critical reasons for the crash. Additionally, her overcompensation and poor directional control further contributed to the accident.
