The driver of V1 merged into the third lane, struck the south curb, and departed the south edge of the roadway. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road. Additionally, the driver admitted to being distracted by talking on her cell phone and listening to the radio at the time of the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and being distracted while driving.
