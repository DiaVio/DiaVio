The reason for this is that the driver of V1 swerved left to avoid hitting a dog that crossed the street in front of the vehicle. However, instead of applying the brakes, the driver accidentally stepped on the accelerator, causing the vehicle to jump the curb and collide with a metal utility pole. This indicates poor directional control and a failure to properly respond to the situation. Additionally, the driver's inexperience may have contributed to the accident.
