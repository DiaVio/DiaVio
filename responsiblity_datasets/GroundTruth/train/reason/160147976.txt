The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass another vehicle by steering left, resulting in the driver losing control of the vehicle. This action ultimately led to V1 entering a counterclockwise rotation, crossing the grass median, and making contact with both V2 and V3. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V1 directly caused the collision and subsequent injuries.
