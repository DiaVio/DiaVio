The reason for assigning primary responsibility to Vehicle one is that the driver admitted to feeling fatigued, tired, and sleepy at the time of the accident. He also mentioned being in a daze and closing his eyes for a couple of seconds. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle one was not fully alert and attentive while driving, which likely contributed to the collision. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle one indicates that the driver of Vehicle two was turning left at the intersection, suggesting that Vehicle one had the right of way. Therefore, Vehicle one should have been able to proceed through the intersection without colliding with Vehicle two if the driver had been fully alert and attentive. It is important to note that the driver of Vehicle two could not be reached for comments, so there is limited information available regarding their actions leading up to the accident. However, based on the information provided, the driver of Vehicle one's fatigue and lack of attention appear to be the primary factors contributing to the collision.
