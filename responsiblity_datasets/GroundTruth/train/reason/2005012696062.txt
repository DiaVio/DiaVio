The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by talking on his cell phone and not noticing that the traffic light had turned red. This recognition error and inattention led to V1 crossing the intersection when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1993 GMC Safari).
