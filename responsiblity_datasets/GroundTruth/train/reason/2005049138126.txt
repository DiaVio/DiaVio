The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the west after the non-contact vehicle encroached into its lane. The critical reason for this departure was the driver-related factor of "internal distraction" (reaching for a cell phone). This indicates that the driver of V1 was not fully focused on the road and was distracted by reaching for her cell phone, which ultimately led to the accident.
