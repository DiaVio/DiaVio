The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 departed the right side of the road and struck a culvert/driveway edge, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. - The driver of V1 was talking on the phone at the time of the crash, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. This internal distraction likely contributed to the driver's loss of control. - The driver was also coded as inattentive, further supporting the notion that her distraction played a significant role in the crash. - The driver was also coded as having poor directional control and lacking experience with an SUV, suggesting that her driving skills may have been inadequate for the vehicle she was operating. Overall, the combination of distracted driving, poor directional control, and lack of experience with the vehicle led to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
