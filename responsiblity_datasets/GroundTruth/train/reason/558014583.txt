The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to see V2, the legally parked Cadillac Deville sedan, until she was closing on it. As a result, she veered to the left to avoid an impact, causing V1 to enter a counterclockwise yaw and strike the rear of V2 with its right quarter panel. This initial collision then caused V1 to rotate clockwise across the center line and enter the path of V3, the southbound Ford Taurus, resulting in a collision between V1 and V3. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for failing to see the parked vehicle and subsequently causing the chain of events that led to the accident.
