The reason for V1's responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see V2 approaching before making the left turn. This lack of surveillance led to the collision between the two vehicles.
