The driver of V1 was cited for an illegal maneuver (failure to yield) while trying to merge into an occupied lane. This indicates that V1 did not properly yield to the oncoming traffic in lane 1, which resulted in the contact with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not familiar with the roadway and may have been impaired by pain medication and dental problems, which could have affected her ability to merge safely.
