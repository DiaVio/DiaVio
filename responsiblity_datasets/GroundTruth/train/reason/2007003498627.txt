The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection, according to the driver of V2 (the Jeep Liberty). V2 attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the collision, indicating that V2 had the right of way and was following the traffic rules. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision.
