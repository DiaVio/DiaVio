The reason for this is that the driver of V1, a 16-year old female, falsely assumed that the intersection was a four-way stop when it was actually a two-way stop. Despite having a stop sign, she proceeded to go without yielding to the oncoming traffic. This false assumption of other road users' actions led to the collision with V2 (the 2001 GMC Sierra). While V2 was traveling above the posted speed limit, the driver took appropriate avoidance measures and was not thought to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1.
