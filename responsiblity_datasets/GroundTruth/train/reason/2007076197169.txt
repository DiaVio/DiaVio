The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver, a fourteen-year-old male who is not licensed, made several errors that led to the crash. Firstly, he steered right to avoid something in the road, which caused him to go off the right side of the road. Instead of correcting his course, he overcompensated by steering left, which led to further loss of control. This overcompensation ultimately caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise and collide with the ditch. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and poor directional control were contributing factors to the crash. Being only 14 years old and having been driving for only 6 months, the driver likely lacked the necessary skills and experience to handle unexpected situations on the road effectively. While the presence of an animal in the roadway may have initially triggered the driver's evasive action, it is ultimately the driver's responsibility to maintain control of the vehicle and make appropriate decisions. In this case, the driver's overcompensation and lack of experience were the primary factors that led to the crash.
