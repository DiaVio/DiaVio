The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons, resulting in V1 departing the roadway, overcorrecting, and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's actions of steering left, then right, and then partially entering lane two indicate a lack of control and failure to maintain the vehicle within the designated lane. Additionally, the fact that V1 rotated slightly clockwise suggests a lack of proper steering control. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This failure to use the seatbelt may have contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries. Therefore, based on the driver's loss of control and failure to maintain the vehicle within the lane, as well as the lack of seatbelt usage, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
