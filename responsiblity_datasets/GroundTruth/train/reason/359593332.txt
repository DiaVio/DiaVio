The reason for this is that V2 impacted the left side of V1, causing the deployment of V1's left side impact airbag and left side curtain. V2's impact resulted in V1 rotating clockwise and V2 rotating counterclockwise, indicating that V2 was the vehicle that initiated the collision. Additionally, V1 sustained serious injuries and was hospitalized, suggesting that the impact from V2 was significant.
