The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 broke traction on the wet road surface and began to rotate counterclockwise towards the center median. As Vehicle 2 crossed the northbound travel lane, it impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1, resulting in severe damage to Vehicle 1 and compounding Vehicle 2's counterclockwise rotation into subsequent events. Vehicle 2 then went on to collide with Vehicle 3 and Vehicle 4. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 initiated the chain of events that led to the accident.
