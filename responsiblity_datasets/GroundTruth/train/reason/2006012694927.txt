The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance and inattention. V1 failed to properly observe the traffic in lanes one and two before initiating the left turn. Additionally, V1 was distracted by thinking about the friend she had just dropped off at the hospital. These factors led to V1 falsely assuming that all traffic in lanes one and two were turning southbound, resulting in the collision with V2.
