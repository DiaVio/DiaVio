The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver had a seizure, which impaired their ability to act and control the vehicle. This seizure occurred after the driver had stopped for the stop sign and ended after the crash had occurred. The driver's history of seizures, confirmed by surrogate statements, and the fact that they take medication to prevent seizures further support the conclusion that the driver's physical impairment was the critical reason for the accident.
