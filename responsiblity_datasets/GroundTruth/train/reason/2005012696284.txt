The driver of V1 reported that he had passed out prior to the crash, indicating a driver-related error due to a physical impairment (possibly a heart attack or other physical condition). This impairment likely caused him to lose control of his vehicle and collide with the back of V2 (the 2001 Pontiac Montana). Additionally, the driver of V1 had a history of Parkinson's and was taking medications that could cause drowsiness and fainting, further supporting the notion that his physical condition contributed to the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was stopped at the light and had just started to proceed when the collision occurred. There is no indication that he was traveling at a higher speed or contributed to the crash in any way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's physical impairment and loss of control.
