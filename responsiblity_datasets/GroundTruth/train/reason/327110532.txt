The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center-line, passed through the intersection, and entered the southbound lane, causing the collision with the SUV. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, while the driver of V2 appears to have attempted to steer back into the northbound lane just before impact. This indicates that V2 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle, resulting in the severe frontal impact.
