The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to negotiate the left-turning curve properly, causing the vehicle to travel across the westbound travel lane and depart from the roadway. Additionally, the driver's unsuccessful attempt to steer right and regain the roadway likely contributed to the vehicle entering a slight left side leading yaw and ultimately colliding with a tree.
