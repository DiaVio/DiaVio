The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver recognized the need to slow down and stop when she saw V2 stopped at the intersection. However, she mistakenly pushed the accelerator instead of the brakes, causing her vehicle to collide with the back of V2. This incorrect evasive action by V1 led to the collision. Additionally, an associated factor for V1's incorrect evasive action was her emotional state due to her current family situation, which may have contributed to her confusion and mistake in pressing the wrong pedal. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her driver-related error in not performing the correct action to avoid the collision.
