The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by talking and looking at the right front passenger just before the crash. This internal distraction caused the driver to fail to notice that V2 (the 2003 Toyota Camry) had come to a stop in front of them, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to brake just prior to impact, indicating that they were aware of the situation but failed to react in time to avoid the crash. It is important to note that the driver of V2 is not assigned a critical reason, suggesting that their actions did not contribute significantly to the collision.
