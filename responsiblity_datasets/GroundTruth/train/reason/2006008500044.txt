The reason for V1's responsibility is that the left rear tire of the vehicle suddenly lost pressure, causing the vehicle to begin weaving and the trailer to jackknife. This indicates a vehicle-related factor, specifically tire failure, as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver had not towed this trailer before and that attaching it caused the rear end of the truck to drop considerably. This could have led to diminished steering inputs and extra stress on the tires, potentially contributing to the tire failure.
