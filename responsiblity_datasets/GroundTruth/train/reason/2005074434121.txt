The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice the red traffic light and entered the intersection, colliding with V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Aurora) who was turning left and had the right of way. V1's inadequate surveillance, specifically failing to see the red traffic light and V2 about to clear the intersection, led to the collision.
