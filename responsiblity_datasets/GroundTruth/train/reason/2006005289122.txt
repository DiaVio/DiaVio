The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the red light at the intersection, which is an illegal maneuver and a clear violation of traffic laws. This failure to obey the traffic control device resulted in V1 striking the right side of V2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Malibu) as it crossed the intersection. The impact then caused V2 to veer into V3 (the 1987 Toyota Camry). While the exact travel speeds of V1 and V2 are unknown, the fact that V1 failed to stop for a red light indicates a clear disregard for traffic regulations, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
