The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (above the posted speed limit of 88 kmph) on a wet roadway. Additionally, the driver stated that she felt her tires lose contact with the road and closed her eyes, indicating a lack of control and attention to the road conditions. The driver's failure to adjust her speed to the wet conditions and her lack of control over the vehicle led to the hydroplaning and subsequent crash.
