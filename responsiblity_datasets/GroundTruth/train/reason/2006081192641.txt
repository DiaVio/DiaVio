The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver had a seizure before the crash, which was confirmed by the driver and the PAR (Police Accident Report). This seizure likely impaired the driver's ability to control the vehicle, leading to V1 departing the roadway and ultimately crashing into a bush.
