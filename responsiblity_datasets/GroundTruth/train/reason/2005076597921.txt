The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: 1. V1 was pulling a trailer that began to jackknife, indicating a loss of control of the vehicle. 2. V1 departed the right side of the road, reentered the roadway, and then departed the left lane line, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. 3. V1 rolled over two quarter turns, suggesting a significant loss of control and inability to recover from the jackknife event. 4. The driver of V1 admitted to noticing that the trailer's electrical brakes were not working about 24 kilometers (15 miles) prior to the crash. This indicates a failure to address a known mechanical issue that could have contributed to the loss of control. 5. The driver of V1 was not wearing his required glasses for a myopic condition, which may have impaired his vision and ability to react to the jackknife event. 6. The driver of V1 has underlying medical conditions (diabetes and high blood pressure) and takes medication, which may have affected his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Overall, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, failure to address a known mechanical issue, failure to wear required glasses, and potential impairment from medical conditions and medication make him primarily responsible for the rollover accident.
