The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to being in a hurry and being distracted by his radio. He also falsely assumed that V2 would yield the right of way to him, even though the left turn arrow is always solid green and unprotected at that intersection. Additionally, V1 had a history of inattentiveness and physical factors that may have affected his driving ability. V2 (the driver of the 1986 Chevrolet Esquire van) also had contributing factors, such as the overinflated LF tire and the improperly secured cargo in the back. However, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic ultimately led to the collision.
