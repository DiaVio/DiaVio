The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the Critical Pre-Crash Event of the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. This suggests that V1 lost control of the vehicle, potentially due to hitting a pothole with the left rear tire. The fact that V1's vehicle struck the curb and continued onto the median, ultimately colliding with a cement barrier, further supports the conclusion of poor directional control. While the investigation revealed a roadway-related factor, namely the exposed curb corner protruding into the roadway, it is important to note that this factor alone would not have caused the crash if V1 had maintained proper control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1's poor directional control is the primary reason for the accident.
