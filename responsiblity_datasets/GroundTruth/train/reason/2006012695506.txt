The reason for this is that the driver of V1 accelerated in an attempt to avoid a non-contact vehicle cutting into her lane. This incorrect evasive action caused her to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in it departing the roadway and striking the guardrail. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and overcompensation were contributing factors to the crash.
