The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and engaged in an argument with the passenger, which was identified as an internal distraction. This distraction likely caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 departing the roadway on the right side. Additionally, the driver's overcorrection after the initial road departure further contributed to the crash. It is important to note that the passenger's statement about the driver assaulting her adds another factor to the case, but it does not absolve the driver of responsibility for the crash. The primary cause of the crash was the driver's distraction and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle.
