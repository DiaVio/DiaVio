The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to use due care by being distracted and not noticing in time that Vehicle #2 (V2) had come to a complete stop. V1's driver was looking around to change lanes and did not pay enough attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's driver made a false assumption that V2 would continue to proceed without stopping, which further contributed to the crash. On the other hand, V2's driver stopped to avoid making contact with a large mattress/furniture in the lane, which can be considered a reasonable action. The critical reason for V2 was not coded, indicating that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to use due care and being distracted, resulting in the collision with V2.
