The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling eastbound in the express section at a high rate of speed and crossed through the intersection against a red light. This illegal maneuver of disregarding the traffic signal directly caused the collision with V2 (1984 Chevrolet Caprice Classic station wagon) and subsequently led to the collision with V3 (1994 Nissan Pathfinder) who was stopped in the northbound left turn lane. V2, on the other hand, was passing through the intersection with the green light and struck the left side of V1 as a result of V1's illegal maneuver. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from crossing street, across path, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event and its critical reason was not coded, indicating that V3 was not primarily responsible for the crash either.
