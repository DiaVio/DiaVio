The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the roadway at the southeast corner of the intersection, striking a utility junction box and sideswiping a utility pole. It then continued on, spinning out and eventually striking a field drainage ditch. Vehicle 1 then entered a cemetery and collided with multiple tombstones before coming to a rest. These actions indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper control while traveling through the intersection and subsequently in the open field and cemetery. The driver's loss of control resulted in the multiple impacts with various objects, including the tombstones.
