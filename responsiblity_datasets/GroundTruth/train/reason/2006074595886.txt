The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was not paying attention to the traffic ahead of her, as she was likely talking on her cell phone. This resulted in her failing to notice that V1 had stopped in front of her, and subsequently striking the rear of V1. The critical reason for the collision was coded as driver-related inattention, further supporting the responsibility of V2.
