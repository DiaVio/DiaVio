The reason for this is that V1 attempted to enter lane one without giving enough space to V2, resulting in a collision between the right rear quarter panel of V1 and the left front fender of V2. V1 then proceeded to continue southbound without stopping, making it a hit and run vehicle. This initial impact caused V2 to lose control and skid into the center concrete median barrier and then into the guardrail. While the exact details of V1's driver and any contributing factors such as fatigue or health-related issues are unknown due to it being a hit and run vehicle, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for initiating the collision and leaving the scene without stopping.
