The driver of V2 was stopped at a stop sign on the residential street and attempted to make a left turn onto the main roadway. However, the driver's view was obstructed by a parked vehicle on the corner, making it difficult to check for oncoming traffic. Despite this obstruction, the driver proceeded to "creep up" into the intersection without properly ensuring it was safe to do so. As a result, V2 entered the path of V1, which was traveling northbound on the main roadway. While V1 did not have a chance to react or perform any avoidance maneuvers, the driver of V2 had a duty to yield the right of way and ensure it was safe to proceed before making the left turn. The obstructed view and failure to properly assess the situation contributed to the collision.
