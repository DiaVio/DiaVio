The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was described as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a performance error of poor directional control. This resulted in the front of the left rear trailer tandem striking the front left corner of Vehicle #1 (the 2002 Ford Taurus). Vehicle #1, driven by a 30-year old female, attempted to avoid the truck by slowing down almost to a stop, but the truck continued into her lane and made contact with her vehicle. Since Vehicle #2 left the scene and was not located by the police, it is not possible to determine any further details or factors that may have contributed to the accident. However, based on the information provided, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #2 due to the poor directional control and encroachment into the opposite lane.
