The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the small tractor was loaded incorrectly onto the trailer, causing improper weight distribution. This resulted in the trailer swaying progressively more violently, leading to V1 losing control and veering off the road. V1 then collided with a steel light pole, causing significant damage and injury to the occupants. Therefore, V1's improper loading and subsequent loss of control are the main factors that led to the accident, making it primarily responsible.
