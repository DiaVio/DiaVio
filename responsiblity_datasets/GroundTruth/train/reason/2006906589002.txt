The driver of Vehicle one admitted to veering into the westbound lane while negotiating a right curve, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle two (1994 Honda Accord). The driver of Vehicle one also stated that he steered right after the initial impact and collided with the rear of Vehicle three (2001 GMC Yukon) which was legally parked on the south side of the roadway. The critical pre-crash event coded to Vehicle one indicates that it was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, suggesting that the driver failed to maintain their lane. The critical reason coded to Vehicle one is a recognition error and internal distraction. The associated factors include fatigue, inadequate surveillance, inadequate/incorrect evasive actions, distractions (talking on the cell phone), and stress. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain their lane, distracted driving, and inadequate evasive actions.
