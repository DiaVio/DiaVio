The reason for this is that V1, traveling north in lane two, failed to maintain a safe distance from V2, the 1997 Freightliner Medium-Heavy Dump Truck, which was stopped and waiting to make a left turn. As a result, V1's front collided with the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and did not have enough time to react and avoid the collision.
