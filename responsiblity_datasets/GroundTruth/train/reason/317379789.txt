The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to crossover the median and turn left into the eastbound lanes, and as it entered the eastbound lanes, it made contact with the left side of V1 (the 2012 Honda CRV). This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
