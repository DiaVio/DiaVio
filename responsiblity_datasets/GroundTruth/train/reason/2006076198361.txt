The driver of V1 admitted to consuming an excess amount of alcohol prior to starting the trip and feeling tired and sleepy while driving. Additionally, the driver had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.18, which is well above the legal limit. These factors indicate impaired driving and a lack of attentiveness on the part of the driver. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically the driver passing out due to alcohol consumption. This suggests that the driver's impaired state led to the vehicle gradually departing the right lane, crossing the rumble strip, and ultimately colliding with the guardrail.
