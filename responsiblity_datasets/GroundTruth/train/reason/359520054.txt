The driver of V1 drifted out of her lane, overcorrected, and began to fishtail, ultimately losing control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 traveling into the northbound lane, veering back to the southbound lane, and then again into the northbound lane. V1 eventually departed the roadway and collided with multiple trees, causing significant damage and passenger compartment intrusion. The driver's loss of control and failure to maintain her lane ultimately led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
