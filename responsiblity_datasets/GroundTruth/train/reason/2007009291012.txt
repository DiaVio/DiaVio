The reason for this is that V2 was stopped in the northbound lane two, attempting a left turn, without a clear indication to the driver of V1. V2 did not signal the intention to turn left, which confused the driver of V1. Additionally, a witness stated that V2 veered slightly right and then back prior to stopping, further contributing to the confusion for the driver of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to signal and the confusing movements prior to stopping are the main factors that led to the collision.
