The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, intending to continue traveling eastbound. However, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2007 Toyota Solara 2-door coupe) which was traveling straight in the westbound lane. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1, causing the collision.
