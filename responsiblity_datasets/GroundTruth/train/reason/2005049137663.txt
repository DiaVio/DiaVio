The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for the red traffic signal and entered the intersection. This action directly led to the collision with V2 (the 2003 Toyota Camry). Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, as they failed to look to either side ahead due to an ongoing conversation with a passenger. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and their inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the collision.
