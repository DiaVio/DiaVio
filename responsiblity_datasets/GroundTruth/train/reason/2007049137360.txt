The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2 (the 2002 Dodge Ram) and failed to look far enough ahead to detect the traffic slowing down. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a violation of basic traffic rules. As a result, V1 was unable to respond in time and collided with the back of V2. V2, on the other hand, was decelerating due to traffic ahead, which is a normal and expected behavior. The driver of V2 checked her rearview mirror to ensure that she would not hit the vehicle in front of her, indicating that she was taking appropriate precautions. Therefore, based on the driver-related factors and the critical pre-crash events, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
