The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, with a reported alcohol level of 0.27, which is significantly above the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to control the vehicle and make appropriate decisions. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to turn right very late, after already traveling about halfway through the intersection, which indicates poor directional control. The driver was also traveling at a speed that was too fast for the curve/turn, as evidenced by the skid marks. These factors combined led to V1 losing control, colliding with the curb, and ultimately crashing into the signal pole.
