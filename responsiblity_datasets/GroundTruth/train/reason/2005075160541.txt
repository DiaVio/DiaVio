The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the light blue 1996 Dodge Stratus) while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. This misjudgment led to the collision between V1 and V2, which then caused the subsequent collision between V2 and V3 (the maroon 1991 Honda Accord). Factors contributing to V1's misjudgment include internal distraction caused by her spouse urging her to turn, her simultaneous assessment of oncoming traffic while weighing her own judgment against her spouse's input, and her admission that her husband often criticizes her driving. Additionally, the V1 driver mentioned having a sinus condition and being under stress, which may have further affected her judgment and decision-making abilities.
