The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting a left turn at the intersection. The driver stated that she let two other northbound vehicles pass before proceeding with the left turn, but she failed to accurately assess the speed or distance of V2. Additionally, the protective left turn arrow was not illuminated at the time she turned, indicating that she did not have the right of way.
