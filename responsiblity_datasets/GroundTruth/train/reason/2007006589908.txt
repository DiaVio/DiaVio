The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two attempted to make a u-turn left without properly judging the gap or the speed of Vehicle one. This misjudgment led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one stated that she was traveling at the posted speed limit and was not expecting Vehicle two to suddenly enter the roadway from a parked position. This suggests that Vehicle two's actions were the main cause of the accident. Therefore, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap and speed of Vehicle one.
