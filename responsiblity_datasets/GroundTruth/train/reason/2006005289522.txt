The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 fell asleep behind the wheel, as stated by the investigating officer and consistent with the evidence at the scene. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not in control of the vehicle and crossed over the double center yellow lines, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two (V2).
