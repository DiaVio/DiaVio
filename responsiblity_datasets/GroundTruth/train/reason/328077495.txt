The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a significantly higher speed than V1, and V2 failed to stop at the stop sign and red flashing light controlling the westbound traffic. Additionally, V2 braked and skidded prior to impact, indicating a lack of control and inability to stop in time to avoid the collision.
