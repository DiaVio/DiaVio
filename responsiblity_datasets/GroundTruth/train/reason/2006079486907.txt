The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to take adequate evasive action. Despite the availability of a wide, paved shoulder to the right, the driver of V1 did not attempt to steer away from the crash. Instead, she only applied the brakes, which was deemed inadequate to avoid the collision. This decision error on the part of V1's driver led to the rear-end impact with V2 (the 1996 Mercedes-Benz C280 sedan). It is important to note that V2 was slowing down for stopped traffic ahead, indicating that V2 was taking appropriate action given the circumstances. However, without further information from the driver of V2, it is not possible to attribute any responsibility to V2 for the collision.
