The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2, who was already in the intersection. This is supported by the fact that V1 was stopped in the designated left turn lane, waiting for traffic to clear before making the turn. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling, turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for the event was listed as an unknown driver error, possibly due to driver inexperience. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over the left lane line" and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. V2 stated that he was in the intersection when the light turned yellow and assumed that V1 would wait until he passed through before proceeding. Therefore, V2's assumption does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to yield the right of way. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection.
