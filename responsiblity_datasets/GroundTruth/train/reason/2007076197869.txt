The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 attempted to change lanes without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver looked at his side mirror and saw V2 in front, assuming that V2 would continue through the light at the intersection. However, when V1 turned his head to check his blind spot and then looked forward again, he ran into the back of V2, which had slowed down for the yellow light. Additionally, V1's driver exhibited driver inattention by thinking about a future event, had an exterior distraction, inadequate surveillance, misjudged V2's velocity, and was following too closely. These factors further contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
