The reason for V1's primary responsibility is due to the following factors: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and driving erratically, as reported by the driver himself and corroborated by witnesses. - The driver of V1 was distracted and engaged in activities such as writing something down and reaching for his cell phone immediately before the crash. - The driver of V1 admitted to being under work-related stress and taking multiple prescribed medications, including an unnamed narcotic. - The driver of V1 reported suffering from depression, which could have affected his ability to focus and make sound judgments while driving. - V1 was overtaking V2 at a high rate of speed and made a dangerous lane change, resulting in contact with the left rear of V2. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not only driving recklessly and aggressively but also impaired by distractions, medication, and emotional stress. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
