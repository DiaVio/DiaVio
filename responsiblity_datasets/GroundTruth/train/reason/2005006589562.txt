The reason for this is that V2 was traveling on the shoulder and re-entered the roadway, contacting the left side of V1. This action by V2 caused V1 to lose control of her vehicle and ultimately resulted in the rollover accident. Additionally, V2 failed to stop at the scene of the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and potentially illegal behavior.
