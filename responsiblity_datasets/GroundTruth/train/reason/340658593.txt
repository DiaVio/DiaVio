The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver experienced a syncopal episode, which caused her to lose consciousness while driving. As a result, she was unable to maintain control of her vehicle and collided with the parked Ford Explorer SUV. The syncopal episode can be considered a medical condition that impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
