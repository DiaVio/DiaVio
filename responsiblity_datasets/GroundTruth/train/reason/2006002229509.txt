The reason for this is that V1 was backing up across both lanes of travel, which is a dangerous maneuver. V2 (the Mercury Tracer) was traveling south on the roadway and struck V1 in the left side with its front. V2 attempted to brake but was unable to avoid the collision. Although V2 was cited for inattention and insufficient braking maneuvers, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for backing up across both lanes without proper caution or warning.
