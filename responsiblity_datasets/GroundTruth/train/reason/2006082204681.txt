The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive and distracted by external factors, specifically the pedestrians on the sidewalk. V1 failed to notice that V2 had come to a stop for the pedestrians in the marked crosswalk. This lack of attention and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front led to the collision. Additionally, V1 admitted to making a false assumption that the forward vehicle (V2) would continue to proceed, indicating a lack of caution and awareness of the situation. The driver's inattentiveness, distraction, and false assumption contributed to the collision and make V1 primarily responsible.
