The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver of V1 turned her attention away from the road to check for traffic on the right, and when she turned back to look ahead, she steered to the right in an attempt to avoid V2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Silverado). However, she was unsuccessful in avoiding the collision and ended up striking the back of V2. Additionally, V1's lack of experience as a driver (less than a year) and the presence of traffic congestion at the time of the accident may have contributed to her inability to respond effectively to the situation. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 Chevrolet Silverado) is not licensed to drive, which is a separate violation. However, this violation does not directly contribute to the cause of the accident as V2 was traveling in the correct lane and had nowhere to go to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to respond to unexpected actions.
