The driver of V2 was stopped in the parking lane and attempted to enter the northbound lane without adequately surveilling the road. The driver admitted to not seeing Vehicle #1 (V1) prior to the impact. This indicates that V2 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
