The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control while negotiating the curve, resulting in a counterclockwise rotation and departure from the roadway. V1 then collided with a large tree and subsequently rolled over into a ditch. The driver of V1 was not wearing a seatbelt, which likely contributed to the severity of their injuries.
