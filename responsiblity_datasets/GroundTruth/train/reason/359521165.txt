The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in lane one of a two-lane, two-way roadway and failed to maintain control of the vehicle. V1 crossed through the intersection, impacted the curb, and ultimately collided with a large tree. The driver of V1 sustained severe injuries, indicating that they were unable to properly control the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that V1's front left and right tires impacted the curb, resulting in wheel and rim damage, suggests that the driver may have been driving at an excessive speed or not paying attention to the road conditions. The wet travel lanes and foggy weather conditions further contribute to the driver's lack of responsibility in maintaining control of the vehicle. It is important to note that the second case occupant, the front right passenger of V1, was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. While this is a contributing factor to the severity of their injuries, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1.
