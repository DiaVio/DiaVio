The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle involved in the collision with the large tree. The driver of V1 lost consciousness while negotiating a left curve, causing the vehicle to travel off the road and ultimately collide head-on with the tree. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 sideswiped a utility pole, although no evidence was found to substantiate this impact. The fact that the driver of V1 was also unbelted further contributes to their responsibility for the accident.
