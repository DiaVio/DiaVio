The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the intersection while waiting for the light to turn green. This indicates a clear lapse in attention and a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. When she was awakened by the sound of a vehicle's horn, she panicked and pressed the gas pedal, accelerating through the intersection while still half asleep. This resulted in V1 jumping the curb, contacting a sign pole, and ultimately crashing into the building's concrete steps. The critical pre-crash event, as identified, was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the accident was coded as sleeping, indicating that the driver was actually asleep at the time of the crash. The associated factors, such as performance error, panic and freezing, and driver fatigue, further support the conclusion that the driver's drowsiness and subsequent actions were the primary cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision to drive while extremely tired and falling asleep at the wheel.
