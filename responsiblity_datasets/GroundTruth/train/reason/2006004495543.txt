The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the Honda Passport, was making a left turn across the northbound lanes of the intersection. V1 stated that she was waved through a gap in traffic by a Non-Contact Vehicle (NCV) and proceeded to make the left turn. However, V1 failed to see V2, the Ford Taurus traveling north in the left-hand turn lane. As a result, V1 struck the right front corner of V2 with its front. V1's false assumption of the NCV's action and her decision to turn with an obstructed view contributed to the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was uncomfortable with the surrounding traffic densities, which may have affected her judgment and ability to properly assess the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way and her failure to see and avoid colliding with V2.
