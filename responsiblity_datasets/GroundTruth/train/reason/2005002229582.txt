The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling too fast for the conditions. It was raining, the roadway was wet, and the driver stated that he was traveling at 40 MPH in a posted 35 MPH zone. This indicates that the driver was exceeding the speed limit and not adjusting his speed to account for the slippery road conditions. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation when the vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise and then clockwise suggests a lack of control and possibly a lack of experience in handling such situations. The driver's statement that he had only been driving for 15 months and had no driver training further supports the notion of driver inexperience as a contributing factor. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed for the conditions and overcompensation while attempting to regain control of the vehicle.
