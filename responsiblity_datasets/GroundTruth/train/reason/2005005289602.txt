The reason for this is that the driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the 1989 Nissan Maxima) had a stop sign at the intersection, even though there were no signs or signals present for the east/west roadway. This false assumption of V2's actions led to V1 proceeding through the intersection without yielding the right of way, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not familiar with the area, which may have contributed to their misunderstanding of the intersection and the traffic rules associated with it. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
