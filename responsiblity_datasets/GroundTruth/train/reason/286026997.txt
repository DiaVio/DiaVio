The reason for this is that V1 was exiting the off ramp and failed to negotiate the curve to the right, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and depart from its lane. This resulted in the front of V1 impacting the concrete barrier and ultimately coming to rest facing south after spinning 180 degrees. The driver of V1 was also unrestrained, which likely contributed to the severity of the head and extremity injuries sustained.
