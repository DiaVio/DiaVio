The reason for this is that V1 failed to realize that V2 was stopped in time to avoid the collision. This is indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being attributed to V1 and coded as "driver related factor: misjudgment of gap or other's speed". Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to have a blood/alcohol concentration of 0.215, which is significantly above the legal limit. The drug test also showed positive results for opiates and benzodiazepine, indicating that the driver was under the influence of drugs at the time of the accident. These factors likely impaired the driver's judgment and reaction time, contributing to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Blazer) was traveling in the same direction as V1 and had no opportunity to avoid the collision, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event being coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: traveling in the same direction with higher speed". However, since V1's misjudgment of the gap and impaired state were the primary factors leading to the collision, V1 is considered primarily responsible.
