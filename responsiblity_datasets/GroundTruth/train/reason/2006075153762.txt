The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to maintain adequate surveillance and were unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the stopped V2 (the 2005 Chevrolet Silverado pickup). Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to have physical and mental factors, including driver fatigue and being upset at the time of the crash. These factors likely contributed to their inability to react in a timely manner and avoid the collision. It is important to note that V2 was stopped in lane three for more than 10 seconds, waiting for the light to change, and there were no critical reasons or associated factors coded to suggest any negligence on their part. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to their failure to maintain surveillance, inability to stop in time, and the presence of physical and mental factors affecting their driving abilities.
