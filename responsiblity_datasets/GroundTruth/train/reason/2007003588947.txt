The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. However, V2 failed to yield and was impacted by V1 (the Dodge Intrepid) traveling in the opposite direction. Additionally, the driver of V2 was found to be inattentive, as he was thinking about the concert and conversing with his girlfriend. This lack of attention likely contributed to his failure to yield and resulted in the collision. Furthermore, the driver of V2 was also fatigued, having only slept for 4 and a half hours prior to the crash. Fatigue can impair a driver's judgment and reaction time, making them more prone to making mistakes on the road. Overall, the combination of inattention, fatigue, and failure to yield on the part of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
