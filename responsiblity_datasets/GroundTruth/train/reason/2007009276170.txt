The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and weaving in and out of traffic, which indicates aggressive driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and crossed over into the southbound lanes, directly into the path of V2. The investigation into the driver's background also revealed a history of traffic violations, suggesting a pattern of irresponsible driving. Furthermore, the presence of alcohol in the driver's system further contributes to their responsibility for the accident.
