The driver of V1 admitted that their vision was obscured by a truck and tractor turning across their path. Despite this obstruction, they accelerated from the stop sign and entered the intersection without taking any evasive actions. This indicates a failure to exercise caution and ensure that it was safe to proceed. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1996 Ford F150) stated that they saw the truck towing the tractor making a left turn across their path and slowed down slightly. They attempted to avoid the collision by steering left, but were unsuccessful in doing so. This suggests that the driver of V2 took some measures to prevent the accident, but the actions of V1 made it difficult for them to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to exercise caution and proceed safely despite having their vision obstructed.
