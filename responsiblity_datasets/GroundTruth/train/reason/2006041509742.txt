The reason for this is that the driver of V1 drove off the left side of the roadway and struck a utility pole. The police report initially listed the accident as a hit-and-run because the driver was pulled out of the vehicle by bystanders or friends, making it difficult for the police to determine whether the injured person was the driver or a passenger. However, it was later determined that the injured person was indeed the driver. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side", indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road. The Critical Reason for this event was coded as poor directional control, which was likely due to the driver's impaired motor skills as a result of alcohol ingestion (BAC reported as 0.23). Additionally, the driver's medical record indicated that he used a C-PAP machine for sleep apnea, which may have further compromised his ability to safely operate the vehicle.
