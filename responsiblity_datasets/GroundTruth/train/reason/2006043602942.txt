The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high speed of 129kmph (80 mph), which is significantly above the posted speed limit of 97kmph (60 mph). - V1 drifted off the left side of the road and struck the concrete barrier, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. - The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, suggesting a lane departure error. - The driver of V1 was arrested for driving while influenced, indicating the presence of alcohol in his system. - The driver's refusal to undergo a sobriety test further supports the suspicion of impaired driving. Overall, V1's excessive speed, lane departure, and the presence of alcohol in the driver's system indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
