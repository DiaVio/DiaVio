The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a left turn across oncoming traffic, and failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making the turn. The driver of V2 did not detect V1 approaching from the opposite direction and did not look far enough ahead to see the oncoming vehicle. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that the driver of V2 may have been under the influence of alcohol, as witnessed by the smell of alcohol on their breath and the presence of a whiskey bottle thrown out of the vehicle. This impairment likely contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the situation and avoid the collision.
