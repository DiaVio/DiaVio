The driver of V1 admitted to accelerating while driving down the sloped surface that curved to the right. This indicates that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve, which was further exacerbated by the wet road conditions due to the light rain. The driver's loss of control, fishtailing, and subsequent departure from the road to the right side all point to the driver's failure to adjust their speed and control the vehicle appropriately for the conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed for the curve and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
