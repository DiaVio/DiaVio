The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a recognition error due to inattention (daydreaming) while turning left at the intersection. This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe and assess the traffic situation before entering the intersection. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 had been awake since 22:00 hours the night before and had worked the late night shift before attending a parent-teacher meeting. This suggests that the driver may have been fatigued, which could have contributed to the recognition error and inattention. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the traffic situation and the possible influence of fatigue make them primarily responsible for the crash.
