The reason for this is that V1 traveled into the rear of V2, resulting in an offset frontal crash configuration. This indicates that V1 was following too closely or not paying attention to the road ahead, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 rotated 360 degrees after the initial impact, suggesting a loss of control by the driver. It is important to note that V2 and V3 were already involved in a previous crash and were at their final resting positions when this crash occurred. The occupants of V2 and V3 were out of their vehicles at the time of the crash between V1 and V2, indicating that they were not actively contributing to the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their actions leading to the collision with V2.
