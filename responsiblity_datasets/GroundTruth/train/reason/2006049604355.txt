The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 80 kmph (50 mph) over an icy bridge, which is considered too fast for the road conditions. This excessive speed led to the loss of control of the vehicle, causing it to depart from the road, impact the bridge wall, and ultimately roll over. The driver's overcorrection also contributed to the rollover. Additionally, the driver was traveling in the HOV lane, which suggests that she may not have been following the designated lane rules. Overall, V1's primary responsibility can be attributed to the driver's failure to adjust her speed to the icy road conditions, resulting in the loss of control and subsequent crash.
