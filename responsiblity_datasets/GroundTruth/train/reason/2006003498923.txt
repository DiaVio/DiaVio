The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the traffic control device, as he did not notice the change from green to yellow before changing to red. This indicates inattention on the part of V2. Additionally, an associated factor that was coded for V2 was an illegal maneuver, as he failed to stop for the traffic control device. On the other hand, V1 (the driver of the Volkswagen Jetta) had a view obstruction due to a highway support pillar, which was coded as a roadway related factor. However, V1 had just started to go in the traffic lane when the traffic control device changed to green, indicating that she had the right of way. Therefore, V2's failure to stop for the traffic control device and inattention make him primarily responsible for the accident.
