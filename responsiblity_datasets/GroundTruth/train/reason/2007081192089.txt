The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the Nissan Maxima) while attempting to make a left turn across the northbound lanes. This misjudgment led to V1 pulling forward and being struck by V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unlicensed and had only two months of driving experience, indicating a lack of experience and potentially inadequate knowledge of traffic rules and judgment skills.
