The reason for this is that V1 was exiting the driveway and attempting to turn left onto the roadway, which means they were required to yield to oncoming traffic. However, V1 failed to do so and collided with V2, causing V2 to rotate and ultimately come to rest in a parking lot. Additionally, V1 fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions.
