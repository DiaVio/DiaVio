The reason for this is that V1 departed from its designated lane multiple times, first moving from the 4th eastbound travel lane to the center eastbound travel lane, then to the 2nd eastbound travel lane, and finally to the far right eastbound travel lane where it sideswiped V2, the 2000 Toyota Corolla. V1 then spun out of control, colliding with a concrete traffic barrier multiple times before coming to a rest. This sequence of events suggests that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and failed to stay within its designated lane, resulting in the collision with V2 and subsequent impacts with the concrete traffic barrier.
