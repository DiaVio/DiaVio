The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle in front of them. This non-contact vehicle swerved to the left to avoid hitting the stalled V2, creating a sightline issue for V1. Despite attempting to brake and steer left, V1 still ended up colliding with the rear of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe speed and distance, as well as their inability to react appropriately to the situation, makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
