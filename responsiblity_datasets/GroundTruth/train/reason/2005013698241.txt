The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver stated he had a diabetic seizure and blacked out, which led to the vehicle departing the road, striking a garbage can, and then reentering the road before ultimately colliding with a fire hydrant. The driver's admission of feeling drowsy prior to the crash, along with the fact that he was on three types of medication (insulin, paxil, and triphasil), further supports the claim of a medical condition causing the blackout. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's physical impairment and loss of control of the vehicle.
