The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the eastbound lanes of the roadway, and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2. V1 proceeded to turn without being able to see V2 due to the obstructed view caused by other vehicles. This false assumption of other's actions and failure to properly assess the traffic situation led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 rarely travels this roadway, which may have contributed to her lack of familiarity with the traffic patterns and the potential risks involved in making the left turn. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 reported not seeing V1 until she turned in front of him, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn.
