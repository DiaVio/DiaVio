The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver's poor directional control. The driver of V1 reported hitting a pothole on the shoulder of the roadway, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle. This indicates that the driver was not able to maintain proper control of the vehicle while navigating the curve, leading to the rollover crash. Additionally, the driver's estimated speed of 83 kph (52 mph) exceeds the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph), suggesting that she was driving at an unsafe speed for the road conditions (dark, raining, and wet roads).
