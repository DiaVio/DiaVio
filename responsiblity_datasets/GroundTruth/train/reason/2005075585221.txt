The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one failed to stop at the stop sign and did not check for traffic before making the right turn. This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver, as she did not notice the stop sign or look left for oncoming traffic. This failure to yield the right of way to vehicle two, which was already in the intersection, resulted in the collision. On the other hand, the driver of vehicle two (the 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was following the rules of the road and attempting to avoid the collision by braking and steering left. Although she was adjusting the radio just prior to the crash, this does not absolve vehicle one of responsibility for the accident. In summary, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and check for oncoming traffic.
