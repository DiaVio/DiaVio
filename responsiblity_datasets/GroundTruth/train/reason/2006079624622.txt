The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a wet roadway with under-inflated tires. The under-inflated tires would have negatively affected the handling capabilities of the vehicle, making it more difficult for the driver to maintain control while negotiating the curve. Additionally, the driver's lack of familiarity with the area and limited driving experience may have contributed to her inability to anticipate the curve and adjust her speed accordingly.
