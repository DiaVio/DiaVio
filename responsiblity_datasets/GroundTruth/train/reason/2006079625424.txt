The driver of V1 was driving in an aggressive manner by speeding and changing lanes frequently. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 93 kmph, which is significantly higher than the speed limit of 56 kmph. This indicates that V1 was driving at an excessive speed. Furthermore, V1 had only eighteen months of driving experience and was in a hurry to drop off his girlfriend. This combination of inexperience and aggressive driving behavior likely contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Toyota Rav 4) was not licensed, which is a violation of traffic laws. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was attributed to V2's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed. This suggests that V2 may have made an error in judgment while turning left at the intersection, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their aggressive driving and excessive speed.
