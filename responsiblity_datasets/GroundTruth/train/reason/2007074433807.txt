The reason for this is that V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. V2's inadequate surveillance was also mentioned as an associated factor in the crash. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
