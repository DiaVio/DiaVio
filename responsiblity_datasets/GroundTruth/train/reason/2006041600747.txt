The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver spilled coffee in the truck, which caused an internal distraction. As a result, his foot slipped off the brake pedal, making it impossible for him to stop the truck in time and avoid the collision with V2 (the 1998 Chevy Geo Metro). This chain of events led to V2 being pushed into V3 (the 2006 Ford Van). Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle due to the spilled coffee and subsequent distraction is the main cause of the accident.
