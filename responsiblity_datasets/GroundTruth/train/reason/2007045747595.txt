The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by his cell phone ringing, causing him to glance down and lose control of the vehicle. This distraction led to V1 veering off the right side of the road and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, the driver's physical health issues (bad back and high blood pressure) and medication, as well as work-related stress, may have contributed to his inability to regain control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related internal distraction and associated factors such as physical health issues, driver inattention, and work-related stress.
