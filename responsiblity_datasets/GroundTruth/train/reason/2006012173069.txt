The reason for this is that V1 was cut off by another vehicle in lane 3, causing V1 to swerve out of control and cross all lanes of travel. V1 then made contact with the center median wall, slid back onto the roadway, and ultimately collided with the guardrail on the right side of the interstate. V1's loss of control and subsequent actions led to the crash. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was traveling at an unknown speed, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to respond effectively to the unexpected actions of the other vehicle. Additionally, the driver had been on the road for most of the day, which may have contributed to fatigue or reduced attention. However, it is worth mentioning that the witness reported another vehicle crashing into V1 while it was at final rest in the center median lane. The responsibility for this secondary collision would need to be determined separately, as it is not directly related to V1's initial loss of control.
