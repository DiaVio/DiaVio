The reason for this is that V1 did not stop at either of the stop signs at the intersection, indicating a failure to yield the right of way. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by personal thoughts and daydreaming, which contributed to her inattention while driving. The fact that V1 was also traveling at a higher speed (64 kmph) than the speed limit for the westbound traffic (40 kmph) further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
