The reason for V1's responsibility is that it changed lanes without maintaining control on the slick road conditions caused by the de-icer. This resulted in V1 rotating counter clockwise and moving across all lanes, ultimately causing the collision with V2. V1's loss of control due to poor road conditions is the critical pre-crash event and the critical reason for the accident.
