The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado) while attempting to make a left turn. V1 was distracted by looking for a specific driveway and did not see V2 approaching in the opposite direction. This failure to observe and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1's associated factors, such as conversing with passengers and not looking far enough ahead, contributed to her failure to notice V2. The wet road conditions due to rain may have also played a role in reducing visibility and traction, making it even more important for V1 to exercise caution and ensure a safe turn. While V2 could have potentially taken evasive action to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to yield and causing the accident.
