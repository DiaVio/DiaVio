The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the rainy and overcast conditions. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event, which states that the vehicle lost control due to traveling too fast for conditions. Additionally, the driver's decision error of traveling too fast for conditions is specified as heavy rain. The fact that the rear tires of Vehicle 1 had only 1mm of tread further supports the conclusion that the vehicle was not properly equipped for the wet road conditions. On the other hand, Vehicle 2 (the 2002 Ford Windstar) was not involved in the first harmful event and therefore does not bear primary responsibility for the crash.
