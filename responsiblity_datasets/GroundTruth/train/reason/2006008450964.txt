The reason for this is that V1 experienced a brake failure, which directly contributed to the accident. The driver of V1 noticed the brake failure while traveling downhill and attempted to avoid hitting a slower moving vehicle in front of them. However, in the process of swerving to avoid the vehicle, V1 lost control and drove off the roadway, ultimately colliding with two parked vans. The brake failure was a vehicle-related factor that directly led to the accident. Additionally, the driver's decision to continue driving into the setting sun, despite the glare, could be considered a contributing factor to the accident.
