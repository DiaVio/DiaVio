The driver of Vehicle 1 was cited for failure to use due care, as he was unable to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle 2. Additionally, Vehicle 1's critical pre-crash event was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, indicating that the driver was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to stop in time.
