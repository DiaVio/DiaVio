The driver of Vehicle 1 failed to observe Vehicle 2 slowing down ahead and abruptly changed lanes to the left, resulting in the front left area of Vehicle 1 impacting the back right area of Vehicle 2. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not paying attention to the traffic conditions and did not maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
