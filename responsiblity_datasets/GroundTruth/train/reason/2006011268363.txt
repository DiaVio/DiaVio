The driver of V1 admitted to being lost in the neighborhood and being unfamiliar with the area. He approached the intersection and failed to come to a complete stop, instead performing a rolling stop. He also incorrectly assumed that the intersection was a four-way stop, expecting east/west traffic to stop. These actions indicate a failure to adhere to traffic rules and exercise caution while driving. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned work-related stress and distractions, which could have contributed to his lack of attention and awareness while approaching the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign, lack of familiarity with the area, and potential distractions.
