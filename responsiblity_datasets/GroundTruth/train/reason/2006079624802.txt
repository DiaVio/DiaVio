The driver of V1 stated that he felt uncomfortable traveling at a high speed in the heavy rain and decided to change lanes to drive at a slower rate than the traffic. However, he was traveling too fast for the wet conditions, which caused him to lose control of his vehicle and hydroplane across all the eastbound lanes. This loss of control resulted in the collision with V2 (the Dodge Caravan). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driving too fast for the wet conditions and losing control of the vehicle.
