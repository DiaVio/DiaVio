The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical non-performance factor. The driver had not slept for 25.5 hours and had been driving for more than 6 hours prior to the crash. This lack of sleep and fatigue likely impaired the driver's ability to react and maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the collision with V2 (the 1996 Freightliner tractor).
