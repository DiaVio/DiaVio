The driver of V1 was making a left turn across the southbound lane, in front of V2, without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This failure to properly observe the approaching vehicle resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance.
