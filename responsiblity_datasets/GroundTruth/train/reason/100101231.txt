Reason: V1 was traveling at a moderately high speed and the driver was not using the seat belt restraint. The driver's diversion of attention to check traffic and failure to notice the slower-moving truck ahead resulted in V1 colliding with the rear of V2. The lack of physical evidence of an avoidance maneuver further suggests that V1 was unable to react in time to avoid the collision.
