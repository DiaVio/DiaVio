The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Chrysler New Yorker sedan, made a poor decision to stop in the middle of the intersection and falsely assumed that the opposing traffic would yield the right of way. This decision to stop in the opposing vehicle's travel lane and encroach into the southbound lanes without any traffic control measures (such as a light or stop sign) contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 was on medication and had undergone a kidney dialysis treatment earlier in the day, which may have affected his judgment and decision-making abilities.
