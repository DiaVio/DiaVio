The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver's drowsiness caused V1 to drift off the road and collide with the bridge abutment. Additionally, there were no evidence of any avoidance maneuvers, indicating that the driver did not take any action to prevent the crash. The testimony of two witnesses also supports the fact that V1 drifted off the roadway.
