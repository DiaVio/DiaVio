The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically in rain and on a wet roadway. - V1 lost traction and started to rotate after hitting a wet patch. - V1's poor directional control resulted in crossing the centerline and impacting the railing on the west side. - V1's inattention due to having a conversation with the passenger may have contributed to the driver's inability to react effectively. - V1's fatigue from lack of sleep and the influence of medications (oxycodone and oxycontin) may have further impaired the driver's reaction time and overall driving ability.
