The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 attempted to make an illegal left-handed U-turn in front of Vehicle #1 (V1). V2 was drifting to the right side of the road and was not paying adequate attention to the driving task due to being lost and looking around for the intended destination. Additionally, V2 did not check all mirrors, which would have allowed them to see V1 approaching. These factors indicate that V2's actions and lack of attention contributed to the collision.
