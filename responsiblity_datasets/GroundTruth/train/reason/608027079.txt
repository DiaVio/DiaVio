The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 attempted to pass a non-contact vehicle on the right, which resulted in the right wheels of V2 traversing the snow-covered roadside. This caused V2 to enter a clockwise rotation, cross the center line, and enter the path of the case vehicle. The driver of V2's decision to pass on the right and the subsequent loss of control led to the collision with the case vehicle.
