The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to pass V2 on the left-hand side while V2 was making a left-hand turn. This indicates that V1 was not following proper traffic rules and regulations, as passing on the left-hand side while another vehicle is making a left-hand turn is unsafe and can lead to accidents. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 fled the scene and the car was reported stolen further suggests negligence on the part of the driver of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their unsafe passing maneuver and fleeing the scene.
