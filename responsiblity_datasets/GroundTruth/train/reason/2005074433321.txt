The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, which was the critical pre-crash event for that vehicle. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: internal distraction (talking on a cell phone). This suggests that the driver of V2 was not fully focused on the road and may have been distracted by the phone conversation. While V1 (the driver of the Buick Regal T-type) was also engaged in a cell phone conversation, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from the opposite direction - over the left lane line. This indicates that V1 was not at fault for the collision. It is important to note that both drivers had consumed alcohol earlier in the evening, but the BAC test results reported zero levels of alcohol for both drivers. However, the consumption of alcohol by V1, along with factors such as driver fatigue and being a diagnosed narcoleptic, may have contributed to the overall circumstances leading to the accident.
