The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the traffic ahead of it and struck the rear of V2, which was stopped in the traffic lane. The driver of V1 admitted to being in a hurry and late for a social appointment, which may have contributed to his inattention and failure to stop. Additionally, the scene evidence showed tire marks indicating that V1 attempted to brake but the tires locked up, suggesting that the driver was not able to stop in time. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to stop for the stopped traffic make them primarily responsible for the crash.
