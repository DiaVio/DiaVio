The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and failed to stop for the stop sign. The driver of V1 admitted to not stopping for the stop sign, and this statement was supported by other sources. Additionally, V1 was found to have made an illegal maneuver by not obeying the traffic control device. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1994 Toyota Camry) was stopped in the traffic lane and was struck by V1, which indicates that V2 had the right of way. The critical reason for V2 was not coded, suggesting that V2 did not contribute to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop for the stop sign and their illegal maneuver.
