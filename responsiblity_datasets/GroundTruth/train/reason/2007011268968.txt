The driver of V1 stated that he had just cleared the lane restriction and was returning to the southbound lane when the vehicle in front of him (V2) suddenly stopped. Despite applying full ABS braking, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2. The reason V1 is primarily responsible is that the driver failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to respond to the unexpected actions of the vehicles ahead. The driver assumed that the other drivers would continue to proceed without stopping, which was a driver-related decision error. This indicates that V1 was not exercising proper caution and did not leave enough space to react to sudden stops. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to anticipate and respond to the actions of other vehicles.
