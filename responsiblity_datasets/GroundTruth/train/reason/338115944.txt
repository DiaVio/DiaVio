The reason for this is that v2 was traveling east over a hillcrest approaching the intersection, and its direction of travel was controlled by a yellow flash signal. V1, on the other hand, was crossing through the intersection heading north, and its direction of travel was controlled by a red flash signal and stop sign. As v1 began crossing the intersection, v2's front impacted v1's left plane, causing v1 to rotate and come to rest off the northeast roadside. V2 also came to rest in the roadway after traveling a short distance east. Therefore, it can be inferred that v2 failed to yield the right of way to v1, resulting in the left side impact and subsequent injuries to the occupants of v1.
