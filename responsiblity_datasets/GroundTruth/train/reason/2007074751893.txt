The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and the curvature of the road. This is evident from the fact that V1 lost control and crossed the median into the northbound lanes, causing the collision with V2. The driver of V1 failed to reduce their speed from the posted speed limit, which was not appropriate for the icy conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust their speed and control their vehicle in the given conditions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
