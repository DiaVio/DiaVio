The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to look far enough ahead and was distracted by an occupant in the left turn lane. This distraction caused him to not notice that V2 had stopped for the red traffic signal. As a result, V1 applied his brakes too late and skidded into the back of V2, causing the collision. Additionally, V1 mentioned that he was in a hurry for a doctor's appointment and felt drowsy due to being sick, which may have impaired his ability to react in a timely manner. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper attention and control of his vehicle, as well as his distracted driving behavior, make him primarily responsible for the accident.
