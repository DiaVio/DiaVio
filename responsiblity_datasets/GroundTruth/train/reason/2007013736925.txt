The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by looking at a construction site and failed to notice V2 (the driver of the 1998 Oldsmobile Bravada) decelerating and preparing to make a right turn into the restaurant parking lot. V1's distraction and failure to anticipate V2's actions led to the collision. Additionally, V1's statement that V2 did not have its blinker on is not a valid reason for not being aware of V2's intention to turn. It is the responsibility of the driver behind to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared for any sudden changes in the lead vehicle's movement. Therefore, V1's external distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road make them primarily responsible for the accident.
