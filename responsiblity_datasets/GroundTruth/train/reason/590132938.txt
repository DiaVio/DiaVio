The driver allowed the vehicle to drive off the left roadside and onto the sand shoulder, which caused the vehicle to become startled. In an attempt to regain the roadway, the driver steered sharply to the right. However, the downward sand shoulder and embankment restricted the vehicle's motion, leading to the vehicle tripping to the left and ultimately rolling over multiple times. The driver's actions of driving off the roadway and overcorrecting contributed to the accident.
