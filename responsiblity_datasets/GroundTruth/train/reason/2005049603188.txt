The reason for this is that V1 made a sudden lane change and slowed down, leaving V2 insufficient space to come to a total stop under the circumstances. This action by V1 created a dangerous situation for V2, causing V2 to be unable to avoid colliding with the rear of V1. Additionally, V1 left the scene of the accident unidentified, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility.
