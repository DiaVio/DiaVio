The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was initially traveling in the wrong direction on the eastbound off-ramp and made an abrupt right turn across the eastbound lanes, directly into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2010 Chevrolet Silverado K1500 series 4x4 pickup truck). This action by Vehicle 1 resulted in the collision and subsequent injuries.
