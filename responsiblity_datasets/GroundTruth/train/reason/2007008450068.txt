The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was traveling at a high rate of speed and weaving dangerously through traffic. Additionally, V1 turned sharply into the driveway, impacting the left curb and causing the vehicle to rollover and collide with V2's front and V3's driver's door. Therefore, V1's excessive speed, reckless driving behavior, and failure to navigate the turn properly led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
