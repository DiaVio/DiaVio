The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 was driving in an aggressive manner, ignoring traffic controls, while responding to a call. The driver falsely assumed that other vehicles would yield to his vehicle due to the lights and siren being activated. This false assumption and aggressive driving behavior led to the collision with V1 and subsequently causing damage to V3 when the traffic signal was knocked over.
