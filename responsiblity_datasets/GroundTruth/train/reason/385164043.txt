The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 initiated a right steering maneuver to avoid a slowing vehicle ahead, but then over-steered and entered a counterclockwise rotation. This caused Vehicle 2 to re-enter the roadway and collide with Vehicle 1 (2010 Subaru Forester) in the westbound travel lane. The subsequent side slap impact and the rollover of Vehicle 2 further indicate that the driver of Vehicle 2 lost control of their vehicle, leading to the collision.
