The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 was distracted by looking at a portable DVD player on the right front seat. This distraction caused the driver to take his attention off the road, resulting in him not seeing V1's turn signals or brake lights and failing to steer far enough away from V1 to avoid the crash.
