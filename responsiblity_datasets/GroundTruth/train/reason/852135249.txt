The reason for this is that V1 was eastbound on a two-lane street with a stop sign at the intersection. It is the responsibility of the driver of V1 to come to a complete stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to any oncoming traffic. In this case, V2, the 2002 Dodge Ram 2500, was northbound on a four-lane roadway with no traffic controls at the intersection. V2 had the right of way and was traveling straight through the intersection. Since V1 failed to yield the right of way and collided with the front of V2, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
