The reason for V1's responsibility is that it drove over a patch of ice in the roadway, causing it to skid counterclockwise off the road and collide with the concrete barriers on the left side of the roadway. The driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the multiple impacts and the final resting position facing oncoming traffic.
