The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was making a left turn from the center lane, crossing the path of oncoming traffic. V2, the New Flyer metro bus, was traveling in its designated lane and collided with the right side of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic while making the left turn.
