The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, being pursued by the police, and failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection. Additionally, the driver was under the influence of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine, which likely impaired their judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. These factors, along with the driver's inadequate surveillance of the intersection, led to V1 entering the intersection without stopping and being struck by V2.
