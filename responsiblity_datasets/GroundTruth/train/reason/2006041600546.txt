The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop as traffic ahead came to a stop, resulting in her vehicle colliding with the rear of V2 (the 2005 Nissan Murano). V1's recognition error and driver inattention were identified as critical reasons for the crash. Additionally, V1 was cited for failure to use due care and no proof of insurance. While V2 was also involved in the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle traveling at a higher speed." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision, as V1's failure to stop was the primary cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to stop and her recognition error, while V2 was not at fault.
