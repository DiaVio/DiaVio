The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes to the right without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane, where V2 (the driver of the Ford F-150) was traveling. V1 failed to detect V2 approaching in lane two and did not see V2 prior to the impact. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that the lane was clear before changing lanes. While V2's fatigue and inadequate surveillance were associated factors in the crash, V1's failure to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes is the primary reason for the accident.
