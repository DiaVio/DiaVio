The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making her left turn. She stated that she did not see V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Ciera) and did not know where he came from. This indicates that V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic before proceeding with her turn. Additionally, V1's statement that she waited for a car to go by before turning suggests that she may have been focused on that car and failed to notice V2 approaching in the opposite direction. This lack of attention and failure to properly observe the roadway contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way make her primarily responsible for the accident.
