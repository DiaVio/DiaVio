The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was proceeding straight through the intersection while Vehicle 1 was in the process of making a left turn. Vehicle 2 impacted the right side of Vehicle 1, causing moderate damage and re-directing both vehicles. The impact resulted in Vehicle 1 rotating clockwise and coming to rest facing northwest, while Vehicle 2 came to rest facing southeast in the eastbound lane.
