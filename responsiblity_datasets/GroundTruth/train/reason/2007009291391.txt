The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at the posted speed of 89 kmph (55 mph) and failed to pay attention to the actions of V1. V2 stated that she applied her brakes at the same time as V1's brake lights came on, indicating that she was not paying enough attention to the road ahead. As a result, V2 was unable to brake successfully and ended up colliding with the rear of V1. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V2 was "Other motor vehicle in lane traveling in the same direction while decelerating," indicating that V2 should have been aware of the presence of V1 and adjusted her driving accordingly. The associated factor of traffic flow interruption caused by the debris in the roadway further emphasizes the need for increased attention and caution while driving.
