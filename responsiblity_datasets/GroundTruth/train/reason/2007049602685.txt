The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control by the driver. The driver attempted to get to an exit ramp from lane four at highway speed, but due to unfamiliarity with the roadway and abrupt steering, V1 lost control and departed the roadway. This indicates that the driver's actions and lack of proper control led to the accident.
