The reason for this is that V1's brakes failed, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The driver attempted to overturn the truck in order to stop it, but in doing so, the front of V1 made contact with the left side of V2 (the Ford Contour), causing V2 to rotate, roll, and land on its side. Additionally, the police investigation revealed that 5 out of the 8 brakes on V1 were not adjusted properly. This indicates a lack of proper maintenance and inspection of the vehicle, which contributed to the brake failure and subsequent accident. Therefore, V1's brake failure and lack of proper maintenance make it primarily responsible for the accident.
