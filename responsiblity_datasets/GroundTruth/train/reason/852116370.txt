The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed from its lane to the right, striking the barrier and then moved left across lane one, entering lane two. This movement caused V1 to impact the right side of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2004 Chrysler Pacifica sport utility vehicle. The impact into V2 caused it to be forced to the right and continued contact with V1. Both vehicles then crossed over lane one and ultimately collided with the cement barrier. Therefore, V1's initial departure from its lane and subsequent collision with V2, leading to the final collision with the barrier, indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
