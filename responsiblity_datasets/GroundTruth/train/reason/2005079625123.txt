The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they ran a red light at the intersection. The witness at the scene reported that the driver of V1 appeared to be distracted, possibly conversing with passengers, and did not recognize that they had run the red light. Additionally, the driver's statement that "the light changes too quickly" suggests a lack of awareness and understanding of traffic signals. V2 (the driver of the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina) reported that they saw V1 enter the intersection and applied the brakes but was unable to avoid the collision. This indicates that V2 was following the traffic laws and taking appropriate action to avoid a collision. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver of running a red light makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
