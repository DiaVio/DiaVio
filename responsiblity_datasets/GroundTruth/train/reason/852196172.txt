The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in lane three on the intersecting street and entered the intersection, failing to yield the right of way to V1, the 2002 Ford Taurus, which was traveling west in lane one. Despite the driver of V2 braking and swerving to the left, the front of V2 still impacted the left front of V1, causing the collision.
