The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed (approximately 145kmph or 90 mph) which was close to 20 mph over the posted speed limit. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's inexperience on the roadway and the worn tread pattern on the front tires, caused V1 to lose control while negotiating the curve to the right. The driver's attempt to get back in the lane resulted in overcorrection and a subsequent clockwise rotation, leading to the collision with the overpass support wall and the concrete traffic barrier. Therefore, V1's primary responsibility for the crash can be attributed to the driver's excessive speed and inability to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve.
