The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and taking his eyes off the road, focusing on changing the radio station. This distraction caused him to not anticipate that V2 (the dump truck) was slowing down and ultimately resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1 made a false assumption about V2's intentions, assuming that V2 would continue at a constant speed. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to pay attention to the road and the actions of other vehicles make them primarily responsible for the accident.
