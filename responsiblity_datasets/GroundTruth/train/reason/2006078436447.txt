The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, as confirmed by multiple witnesses and supported by information from the vehicle data recorder. The driver of V1 failed to stop or slow down for the red light, indicating an illegal maneuver. The driver's claim of intending to make a right turn is contradicted by the data and physical evidence, which show that V1 was actually intending to go straight through the intersection.
