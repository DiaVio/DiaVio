The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2, which initiated the chain reaction leading to the collision of all five vehicles. The driver of V1 did not attempt any braking prior to impact and the impact did not deploy the frontal airbags. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as an unknown recognition error due to the driver's refusal to be interviewed and inadequate surveillance, failing to look far enough ahead.
