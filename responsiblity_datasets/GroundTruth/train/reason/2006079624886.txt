The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 veered right and entered the parking lane, where the front of V1 impacted the back of V2 (the parked 2001 Honda Accord). The driver of V1 reported to the police that he reached down to retrieve his cell phone, which caused him to veer off the road. This indicates that the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, the police suspected that the driver of V1 was intoxicated, although the BAC test revealed no alcohol presence. The driver of V1 also reported taking medications for anxiety and pain-killer addiction, which could have impaired his ability to drive safely. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction, potential intoxication, and medication use, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
