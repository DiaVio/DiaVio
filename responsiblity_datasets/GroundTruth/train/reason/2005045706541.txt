The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection from the east (right) and collided with the right side of Vehicle 2 (the 2001 Mack concrete mixer truck). Vehicle 2 was northbound in the right through lane, passing through the intersection on a solid green light. Vehicle 1's driver had an unknown recognition error, as she had no recollection of why she entered the intersection at all. Additionally, an illegal maneuver (failed to stop for traffic control device) was coded as an associated factor for Vehicle 1. On the other hand, Vehicle 2's driver assumed that Vehicle 1 would yield the right of way, which was a false assumption of other road users' actions. However, this does not absolve Vehicle 1 of responsibility for entering the intersection and colliding with Vehicle 2. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's unknown recognition error and failure to stop for the traffic control device.
