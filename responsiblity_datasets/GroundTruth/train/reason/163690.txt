The reason for this is that the driver of V1 entered onto the exit ramp too fast and was unable to complete the right curve, resulting in the vehicle departing the left side of the exit ramp and rolling down the embankment. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and adhere to the speed limit, leading to the accident.
