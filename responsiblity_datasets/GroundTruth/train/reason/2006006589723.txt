The driver of V1 admitted to attempting a right turn at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), which is the posted speed limit. However, the driver failed to realize that caution was required due to the snow and icy conditions on the road. This decision error of traveling too fast for the conditions led to the loss of control of the vehicle and subsequent collision with the metal fence and gate. While the icy road conditions may have contributed to the driver's loss of control, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their speed and driving behavior accordingly. In this case, the driver's failure to recognize the need for caution in snowy and icy conditions is the primary reason for the accident.
