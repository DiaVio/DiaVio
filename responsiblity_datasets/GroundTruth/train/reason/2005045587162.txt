The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with failure to yield and DUI, indicating that they did not yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 (the Jeep Wrangler) and were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. The driver's failure to accurately judge the gap distance and the speed of other vehicles, combined with their decision to proceed with the left turn despite being indecisive, led to the collision. Additionally, the EDR information revealed that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not wearing a seatbelt, which may have contributed to the severity of their injuries and the damage caused by the crash.
