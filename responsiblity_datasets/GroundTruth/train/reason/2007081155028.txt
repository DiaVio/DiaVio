The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed while negotiating a right turn, which indicates that they were driving too fast for the curve/turn. This driver-related factor led to poor directional control and overcompensation, causing V1 to leave the roadway and ultimately roll over. Additionally, the tires on V1 had minimal tread depth and were underinflated, which likely contributed to the driver's loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed, poor control, and inadequate tire maintenance.
