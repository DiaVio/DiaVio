The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed between 56 and 72 kmph (35 - 45 mph), which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) for the primitive dirt road with washboard conditions. The driver's excessive speed for the road conditions caused the vehicle to slide and ultimately roll over, resulting in the crash.
