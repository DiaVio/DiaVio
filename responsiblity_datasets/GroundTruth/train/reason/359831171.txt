The reason for this is that V2 lost control and departed the on-ramp, crossing over the paved gore point area and entering the eastbound lanes. V2 then collided with Vehicle 3 (V3), causing V3 to move to the right in an attempt to avoid the collision. As a result, V2's right side impacted the left side of V3. After this initial collision, V2 continued traveling in a southwesterly direction and crossed over the center raised curbs, entering the eastbound lanes. V2 then collided with Vehicle 1 (V1), resulting in the deployment of V1's airbags and severe injuries to the driver. Therefore, V2's loss of control and subsequent collisions with V3 and V1 indicate that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
