The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one made a false assumption of the actions of other vehicles. The driver saw the other vehicles stop at the yellow light and assumed that all vehicles were stopping. However, Vehicle two (2003 Pontiac Bonneville) was still proceeding through the intersection in the first lane when Vehicle one turned left. This false assumption led to the collision between the two vehicles.
