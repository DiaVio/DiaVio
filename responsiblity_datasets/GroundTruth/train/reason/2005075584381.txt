The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 (the 2002 Jeep Cherokee) stopping suddenly for a non-contact vehicle making a U-turn. V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the back of V2.
