The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by thoughts and not noticing the red signal. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying attention to the traffic signal and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 2001 Ford Windstar minivan) which had a green light. Additionally, the police reported that the driver of V1 had been at fault in three recent crashes, suggesting a pattern of reckless or negligent driving behavior. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and failure to yield the right of way.
