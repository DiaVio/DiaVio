The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions, specifically snow-packed and icy road conditions. The driver stated that she swerved to avoid the non-contact vehicle that suddenly changed lanes, but ultimately, it was her inability to maintain control of the vehicle on the slick road surface that led to the collision with the cement barrier and brick wall. While the sudden lane change by the non-contact vehicle may have contributed to the situation, the primary cause of the accident was the driver's inability to navigate the curve safely due to the icy road conditions.
