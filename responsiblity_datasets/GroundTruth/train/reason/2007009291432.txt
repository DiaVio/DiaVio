The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by her cell phone. She admitted to looking at her cell phone to see who was calling when the crash occurred. This distraction caused her to fail to notice V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Astro minivan) stopped in front of her in the same lane. Additionally, the presence of alcohol on the driver's breath suggests impaired judgment and reaction time, further contributing to her responsibility for the crash.
