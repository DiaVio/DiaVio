The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they performed an illegal maneuver by proceeding straight through the intersection when the traffic signal was still red. This action violated the traffic laws and resulted in the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1986 Chevrolet Monte Carlo), who had the right-of-way. Additionally, V1's lack of familiarity with the roadway and distraction from thinking about the job site route may have contributed to their failure to properly observe and obey the traffic signal. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
