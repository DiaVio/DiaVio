The reason for this is that V1 drifted over the double yellow centerline into the path of travel of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2008 Pontiac Torrent SUV. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, but was unable to do so. The impact occurred when the front left corner of V1 collided with the front left corner of V2 in an offset frontal configuration.
