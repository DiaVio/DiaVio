The reason for this is that V1 lost control while negotiating a left curve, crossed the grass median, and re-entered the roadway, ultimately impacting V2 (the 2009 Dodge Charger sedan) in the left lane of travel. This indicates that V1 was the vehicle that deviated from its intended path and caused the collision.
