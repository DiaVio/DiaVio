The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and not paying attention to the road in front of her. She was thinking about various personal and emotional problems, which caused her to have a recognition error and not react in time to the deceleration of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that her flip-flop got caught in the pedal, further contributing to her inability to stop in time. Therefore, V1's lack of attention and distraction, along with the physical conditions and medications she was taking, make her primarily responsible for the accident.
