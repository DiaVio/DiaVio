The driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep, causing the vehicle to drift out of its lane and into the lane of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1988 Nissan Sentra. V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2 and struck the back left of V2. The driver of V1's fatigue and falling asleep while driving directly contributed to the initial collision and subsequent rollover of V1. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
