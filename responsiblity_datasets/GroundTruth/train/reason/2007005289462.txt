The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 129 kmph (80-90mph) in an area with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55mph). This indicates that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions of the roadway, specifically the left curve. The witness interview also confirms that V1 was traveling at a high speed and was in an uncontrollable skid. Additionally, the report mentions that V1's right tires left the roadway, possibly due to driver overcompensation, before the vehicle began to skid laterally. This suggests that V1 may have lost control of the vehicle due to excessive speed and overcompensation while trying to return to the roadway. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to negotiate the curve safely are the primary factors that led to the accident.
