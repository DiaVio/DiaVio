The driver of V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic when entering the interstate bypass highway. This failure to yield resulted in a situation where V1 had to take evasive action to avoid a collision with the bus that was changing lanes. However, the driver of V1 overcompensated while trying to avoid the collision, causing the vehicle to lose control and ultimately crash into the guardrail. Additionally, it is mentioned that there were no signage or warnings posted for the ramp traffic to yield to the interstate traffic. While this may contribute to the overall situation, the primary responsibility still lies with the driver of V1 for not yielding to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield and subsequent overcompensation while trying to avoid a collision.
