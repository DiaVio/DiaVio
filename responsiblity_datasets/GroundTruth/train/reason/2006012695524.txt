The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to complete a full stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection. - V2, who had the right of way, was traveling westbound in the second lane of travel. - V1 was struck on the left side by the front of V2, indicating that V1 entered the intersection when it was not safe to do so. - The witness at the scene stated that V1 did not stop for the stop sign, further supporting V1's failure to yield the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2 makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
