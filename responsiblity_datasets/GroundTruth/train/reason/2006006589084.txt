The reason for this is that Vehicle two was traveling southbound in lane two, intending to make an illegal left turn. Vehicle one (1995 Chevrolet Impala) was traveling northbound in lane one and had the right of way. Vehicle two failed to yield to oncoming traffic and made an illegal left turn, resulting in a collision with Vehicle one. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle two admitted to not paying attention to the sign indicating no left turns and being unfamiliar with the roadway. The driver's inattention and lack of awareness of the road rules contributed to the crash.
