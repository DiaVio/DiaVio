The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal factor, specifically reaching for a tipping cup of coffee. This distraction caused V1 to travel off the left side of the roadway, leading to the subsequent collision with the jersey barrier. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation while trying to regain control of the vehicle further contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the single-vehicle crash.
