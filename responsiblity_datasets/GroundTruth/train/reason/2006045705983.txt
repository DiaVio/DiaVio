The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is as follows: 1. The driver of Vehicle #1 was fatigued and had not slept in over 27 hours prior to the crash, which led to him falling asleep at the wheel. 2. The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to having "one or two beers" before leaving work, indicating possible impairment. 3. Medical records showed that one hour after the crash, the driver of Vehicle #1 had a BAC of 0.253, well above the legal limit. 4. The driver of Vehicle #1 was unable to remember if he was wearing a seatbelt, suggesting a lack of proper safety precautions. 5. The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating a loss of control by the driver. Overall, the combination of fatigue, possible impairment, high BAC, and lack of control by the driver of Vehicle #1 makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
