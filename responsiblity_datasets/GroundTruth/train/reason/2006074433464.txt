The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by the tractor-trailer in front of them and failed to notice V2 (the 1987 Dodge Dakota) entering the intersection. This distraction caused the driver of V1 to focus on decelerating to avoid a rear-end collision, instead of paying attention to oncoming traffic. As a result, V2, who had the right of way, was unable to avoid the collision and struck the right side of V1 in the intersection. The subsequent rotation of V1 led to a collision with V3 (the 2003 Chevrolet Suburban) as well. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to their distracted driving and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
