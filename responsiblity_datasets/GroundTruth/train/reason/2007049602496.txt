The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he was traveling over the speed limit at 80 kmph (50 mph), which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph) for the east-west roadway. Additionally, V1 admitted to being in a hurry and stated that he got up only ten minutes before leaving his residence. These factors indicate that V1 was not driving with due care and attention, and his inexperience as a 16-year-old driver further contributes to his primary responsibility for the crash.
