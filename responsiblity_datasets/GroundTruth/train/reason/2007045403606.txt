The reason for V2's responsibility is that it was parked on the right eastbound shoulder of the roadway, which is not a designated parking area. This placement of the truck created a hazard for other vehicles traveling on the roadway. V1, the Acura Legend, was forced to take evasive action to avoid a collision with another vehicle, and as a result, ended up colliding with V2. If V2 had not been parked in an unauthorized area, the accident would not have occurred.
