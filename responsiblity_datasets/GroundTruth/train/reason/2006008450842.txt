The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and proceeded to make a left turn without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) who was approaching the intersection in the northbound lane. V1 misjudged the gap distance and thought she had enough time to make the turn before V2 entered the intersection. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the hill and shrubbery further obscured V1's visibility, contributing to the misjudgment. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the gap distance led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
