The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the right wheels to depart the right pavement edge while negotiating a left curve on a downhill slope. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. The subsequent attempts to re-enter the road and the resulting collision with a tree further demonstrate the driver's negligence in maintaining control of the vehicle.
