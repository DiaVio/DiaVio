The reason for this is that V1 was traveling above the posted speed limit and was driving too fast for the rain slickened roadways. The driver's excessive speed, combined with the wet conditions, led to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent rollover. Additionally, the driver was found to have unsafe tires with insufficient tread depth, which likely contributed to the lack of control on the wet roadway. The driver's positive test for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) also raises concerns about impaired driving.
