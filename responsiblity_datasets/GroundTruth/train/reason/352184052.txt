The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 departed from the right edge of the roadway and initiated a left steering maneuver, but over-steered, leading to a right side leading yaw. This resulted in Vehicle 1 crossing through the southbound travel lane and colliding with two trees. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the roadway ultimately caused the accident.
