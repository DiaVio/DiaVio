The driver of V1 disregarded the down crossing gates and attempted to make a left turn in front of the approaching train. This illegal maneuver directly led to the collision between V1 and the train. Additionally, the driver's lack of driving experience and unfamiliarity with the vehicle may have contributed to the driver's poor judgment in attempting to make the turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's illegal maneuver and lack of driving experience.
