The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver of V1 stated that they noticed the wet roadway with ice along the curb as they approached the intersection, yet they failed to adjust their speed accordingly. This resulted in their vehicle sliding on the ice and colliding with the rear of V2. While V2 (the driver of the 2001 Chevrolet Venture) may have contributed factors such as being unfamiliar with the area and feeling uncomfortable with traffic densities, the primary cause of the crash lies with V1's failure to adapt their driving behavior to the hazardous road conditions.
