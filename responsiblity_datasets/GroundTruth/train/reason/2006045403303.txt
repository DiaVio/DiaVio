The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2, which had the right of way. V1 misjudged the speed and available gap distance of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's actions of accelerating and steering left indicate that the driver saw V2 but still failed to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
