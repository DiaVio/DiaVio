The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve. The driver first rotated counterclockwise, then overcorrected, causing the vehicle to go into a clockwise yaw with the left side leading. This ultimately resulted in V1 rolling over multiple times before coming to a final rest on its left side. The driver's loss of control and subsequent overcorrection indicate a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle, which led to the rollover. Additionally, the wet roadway conditions may have contributed to the driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle. It is important to note that the responsibility for the accident may be subject to further investigation and analysis by relevant authorities.
