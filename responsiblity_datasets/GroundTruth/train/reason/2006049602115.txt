The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the driver's statement that another vehicle encroached into his lane from the left and ran him off the road. However, there is no evidence or witness statement to support this claim. Additionally, the driver's admission of only having 4 hours of sleep the previous night, along with his fatigue and nervousness at the scene, suggests that he may have been fatigued or even falling asleep while driving. This is further supported by the presence of skid marks indicating that the driver attempted to apply the brakes prior to the impact with the tree. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, potentially due to fatigue or falling asleep, is the primary reason for the accident.
