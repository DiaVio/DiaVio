The reason for V1's responsibility is that they made a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection, resulting in V2 colliding with the right side of V1. V1's failure to notice V2 and their inadequate surveillance is the critical reason for the accident. Additionally, the presence of alcohol in V1's vehicle is an associated factor that may have contributed to their inability to notice V2.
