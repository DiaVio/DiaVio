The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 failed to negotiate the curve and departed the roadway, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle. - V1 struck a warning sign and went up an embankment before entering a concrete canal, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. - V1 traveled a significant distance in the canal, causing damage to the tires, wheels, and undercarriage, indicating a failure to take corrective action to avoid the canal. - The driver of V1 tested positive for a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.245, which is well above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This indicates impaired judgment and decision-making abilities. - The driver admitted to feeling fatigued prior to the crash, which could have contributed to a lack of alertness and decreased ability to control the vehicle. - The driver's inability to recall anything about the crash further suggests a lack of awareness and attention while driving. Overall, the combination of the driver's impaired state due to alcohol consumption, potential fatigue, and lack of control over the vehicle indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
