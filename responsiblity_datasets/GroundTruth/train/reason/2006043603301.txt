The reason for this is that V2 swerved into V1's lane without warning, causing V1 to take evasive action and ultimately leading to the crash. V1's driver stated that he tried to avoid V2 by steering into lane two, but there was a vehicle stopped in that lane, forcing him to continue into the median. This indicates that V1's actions were a direct result of V2's sudden lane change. Additionally, the presence of the bumper in the roadway, which was reported to have caused traffic flow interruptions, further supports the notion that V2's actions were the primary cause of the crash.
