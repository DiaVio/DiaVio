The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Buick Century) while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. This is evident from the fact that V1 stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded to make the left turn without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed to have always made a right turn at the intersection before the accident, indicating a lack of familiarity or understanding of the proper procedure for making a left turn at the intersection. Furthermore, the driver of V1 failed to detect V2 prior to the impact, suggesting a lack of attention or awareness while making the left turn. Overall, V1's failure to yield the right of way and lack of attention or awareness while making the left turn make them primarily responsible for the accident.
