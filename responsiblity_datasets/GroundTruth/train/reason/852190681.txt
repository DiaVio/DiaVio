The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher rate of speed and impacted the back left of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2005 Audi A4 sedan. This impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise and depart the roadway, ultimately striking two small trees before coming to a final rest off the roadway. V1 also rotated clockwise after the impact and traveled across the southbound travel lane, the west parking lane, and departed the roadway to the left. V1 continued to rotate clockwise and came to a final rest in the west parking lane. The uneven crush pattern on V1 indicates that V1 underride V2's rear bumper, suggesting that V1 was at fault for the collision. Additionally, V1's undercarriage scraping the concrete curb and sustaining minor damage further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the severity of the injuries sustained by the 20-year-old female driver in V1 may also be taken into consideration when determining responsibility.
