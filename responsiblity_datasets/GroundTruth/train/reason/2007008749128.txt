The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 stated that he lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve, with the steering wheel shaking and being unable to steer to the left. - The driver also mentioned that braking was not working effectively. - The driver appeared to be intoxicated at the time of the interview, with a blood alcohol test result of 0.245. - The driver's son, who was driving ahead of him, witnessed his father fighting with the steering wheel. - The driver began braking after the collision with the utility pole, indicating a delayed reaction. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that V1's driver was impaired by alcohol, which likely contributed to his loss of control and inability to steer properly. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
