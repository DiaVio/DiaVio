The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline into the northbound lane while negotiating a right curve. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the appropriate lane. Additionally, the driver reported relinquishing control of the vehicle by taking her hands off the steering wheel prior to the first impact. This further demonstrates a lack of attentiveness and responsibility while driving. Furthermore, Vehicle 1 subsequently departed the right pavement edge and encountered a steep drop off, leading to a rollover and subsequent impact with a utility pole. These actions suggest a failure to properly navigate the roadway and respond appropriately to the road conditions. Overall, the driver's actions and lack of control resulted in the accident, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible.
