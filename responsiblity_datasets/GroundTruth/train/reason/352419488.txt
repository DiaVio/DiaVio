The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 67-year-old female driver, failed to negotiate the right turn at the intersection and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to properly control the vehicle and navigate the turn, resulting in the accident.
