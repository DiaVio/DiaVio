The reason for V1's responsibility is due to the driver's aggressive driving behavior, as indicated by the police report and the driver's arrest for driving under the influence of methamphetamines. The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 129 kmph (80 mph) and veered right across the lanes, ultimately colliding with the impact attenuator. This reckless behavior and impaired state likely contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision with V2.
