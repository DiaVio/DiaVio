The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that it overrode the case vehicle (2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser) following the severe frontal impact. This indicates that V2 was likely traveling at a higher speed or failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the collision and subsequent override of the case vehicle.
