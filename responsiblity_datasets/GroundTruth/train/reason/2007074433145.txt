The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of safe driving practices. Falling asleep while driving is extremely dangerous and can lead to loss of control of the vehicle, as evidenced by V1 veering to the right and colliding with the parked V2. The driver's fatigue, having been awake for more than 24 hours with only a one-hour nap, further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
