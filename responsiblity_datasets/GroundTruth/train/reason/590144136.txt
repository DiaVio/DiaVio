The driver of V1 abruptly steered left into the southbound number-two lane to avoid the stopped vehicles ahead. However, the driver then abruptly steered back to the right, causing the vehicle to enter into a clockwise yaw and ultimately collide with the back of V2 (the 2005 Ford F-150 pickup). This indicates that the driver of V1 made a sudden and erratic maneuver, which led to the collision.
