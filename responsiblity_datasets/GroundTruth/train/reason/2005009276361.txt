The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 made an illegal maneuver by turning right from the left turn only lane, crossing over three lanes of traffic. This action violated traffic laws and resulted in Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Acura RL) striking Vehicle 1 on its right side, causing it to overturn onto its left side.
