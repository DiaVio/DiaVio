The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or speed of V2 (the Ford F-250) and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a rear-end collision. This is supported by the fact that V1's front impacted V2's back bumper. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a history of being involved in two other crashes within the past year, suggesting a pattern of poor driving judgment. The driver's hearing impairment and unknown vision level, along with the presence of prescription sunglasses, further indicate potential factors that may have contributed to the misjudgment of the gap or speed of V2. On the other hand, no factors were coded for V2, indicating that the driver of V2 was not at fault in this particular accident.
