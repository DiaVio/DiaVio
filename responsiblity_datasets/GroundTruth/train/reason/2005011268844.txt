The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it exited the roadway to the right and contacted a tree, causing it to re-enter the roadway and roll over multiple times. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the driver's impaired ability to control the vehicle due to a combination of alcohol and medication further contributes to V1's responsibility for the crash.
