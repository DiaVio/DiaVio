The reason for this is that V1 drifted left across the center lane and into oncoming traffic, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane control. This resulted in V1 colliding with a wooden light pole and subsequently rolling onto its left side. The driver of V1 sustained serious injuries as a result of the crash.
