The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 experienced a vehicle control loss due to a non-disabling vehicle problem, specifically a stuck gas pedal. This caused the tires to spin and lose traction, resulting in the driver losing control of the vehicle. The driver's attempt to regain control by using the brakes and steering was unsuccessful, ultimately leading to the collision with the planter box and V2 (the Dodge Caravan). Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to feathering the throttle and not stomping on the gas pedal to get it to return to the closed position, which could have potentially prevented the loss of control. The driver's inattention, as they were focused on a financial matter, may have also contributed to the crash. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
