The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and struck the right side of V2 (the 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan). This indicates that V1 failed to yield to V2, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident in V1's case was "inattention/daydreaming," as the driver stated they were on their way to their sister's accident. This suggests that the driver of V1 was not paying attention to the road and failed to observe the traffic signal or the presence of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and their inattentive driving behavior.
