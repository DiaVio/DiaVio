The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it departed the right side of the roadway and struck a bridge with its left side. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the bridge. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of 113 kmph (70 mph) for V1 indicates that it was traveling significantly over the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (45 mph). This suggests that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, which were described as clear, dry, and dark. Without further information about the driver's condition or any other contributing factors, it can be concluded that V1's driver error, specifically traveling too fast for conditions and failing to maintain control of the vehicle, is the primary reason for the crash.
