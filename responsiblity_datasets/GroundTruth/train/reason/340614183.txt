The reason for this is that V1 was crossing over the southbound lanes to enter an access road, and it crossed the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2004 Chevrolet Impala. V2 was traveling in the center southbound lane and had the right of way. V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and crossing into the path of V2 resulted in the collision.
