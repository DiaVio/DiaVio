The reason for V2's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V1 (the white Chevrolet Express cargo work van) that was stopped in the traffic lane waiting to make a left turn. The driver of V2 indicated that she was looking forward prior to the collision and initially thought that V1 was in motion. However, by the time she realized that V1 was actually stopped, it was too late to avoid the collision.
