The reason for this is that V2 attempted to avoid a collision with Vehicle 3 (V3) by braking and steering to the left, but ended up impacting the back of V3. This action caused V2 to travel further into the northbound lane, resulting in the front of Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2000 Honda Odyssey minivan, impacting V2's right side. Therefore, V2's actions ultimately led to the collision between V1 and V2.
