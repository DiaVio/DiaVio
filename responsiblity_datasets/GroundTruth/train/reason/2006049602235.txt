The reason for this is that the driver of V1 tested positive for methamphetamines, cocaine, and opiates in his system. This indicates that he was under the influence of drugs while driving, which impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he did not have time to make any avoidance maneuvers, suggesting that he was not paying attention or reacting appropriately to the situation. On the other hand, there is no further information available for the driver of V2 (the 1993 Lexus EC400), so it is not possible to determine if any factors contributed to their involvement in the accident. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired state and lack of avoidance maneuvers.
