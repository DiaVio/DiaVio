The reason for this is that V1's front contacted the back of V2 while V2 was stationary in lane 1 of the entrance ramp waiting to merge. The driver of V1 admitted to following too closely and not expecting V2 to stop in the lane. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance and failed to anticipate the actions of the vehicle in front, resulting in the collision.
