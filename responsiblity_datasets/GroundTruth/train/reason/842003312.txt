The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the left pavement edge and enter the center median area, resulting in the impact with a reflector post. This initial event caused the vehicle to start a clockwise rotation and eventually led to a rollover. The driver's steering input and the vehicle's lateral motion against the soft soil caused the vehicle to tip over, resulting in severe top damage. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle 1 was reported as unrestrained and fully ejected during the rollover, indicating a lack of proper safety measures. On the other hand, the front right passenger of Vehicle 1 was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of Vehicle 1 due to their actions leading to the rollover and their failure to use proper restraints.
