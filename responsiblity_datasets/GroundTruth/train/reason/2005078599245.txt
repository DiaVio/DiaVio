The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road. The driver admitted to looking down at paperwork on the right front seat, which caused her to not notice that V2 (the Chevrolet Silverado pickup) had stopped at the stop sign. When the driver finally looked up and saw V2, she applied the brakes but was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a proper lookout for other vehicles on the road make her primarily responsible for the accident.
