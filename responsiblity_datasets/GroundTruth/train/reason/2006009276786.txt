The driver of Vehicle 1 failed to give full time and attention to Vehicle 2 (1988 Ford Thunderbird) and struck it in the rear end. The passenger in Vehicle 1 stated that Vehicle 2 had a slow start and assumed that it would proceed once the light turned green. However, Vehicle 2 did not proceed, and Vehicle 1 collided with it. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 misjudged the gap or speed of Vehicle 2, leading to the collision.
