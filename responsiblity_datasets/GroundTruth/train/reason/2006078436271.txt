The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1 and coded as a driver-related recognition error, specifically inadequate surveillance. This means that V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see the approaching V2, resulting in the collision.
