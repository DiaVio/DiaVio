The driver of V1 was distracted by being on his cell phone and looking for a pen in his glove box. This distraction caused him to veer off the roadway and collide with a pole. Additionally, the driver was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, which impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. The driver's multiple medical conditions and the medication he was taking may have also contributed to his impaired driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's negligence, distraction, and impaired state.
