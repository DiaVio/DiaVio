The reason for this is that V1, while intending to turn left into the driveway, misjudged the speed of V2 approaching from the opposite direction. V1 slowed down and began to turn across V2's lane of travel without ensuring that it was safe to do so. As a result, V2 was unable to avoid colliding with V1, despite attempting to brake and swerve to the right. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the other vehicle's speed and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
