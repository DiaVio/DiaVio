The reason for this is that V2 attempted to merge into V1's lane, causing V1 to swerve to the right in an attempt to avoid the collision. V1 lost control of her vehicle and ultimately collided with a light pole and came to a rest on the side of the road facing the opposite direction. There is no evidence to suggest that V1's vehicle was actually hit by another car, indicating that V2's incorrect evasive action was the main cause of the crash.
