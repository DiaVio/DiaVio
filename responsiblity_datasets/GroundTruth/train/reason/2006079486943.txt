The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately check for cross-traffic before making a left turn at the intersection. The driver admitted that she was focused on a large truck crossing in the number two lane traveling northbound and did not recheck northbound traffic behind the truck while negotiating her left turn. This failure to properly survey the intersection and check for oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2 (the Ford Windstar).
