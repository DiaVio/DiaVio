The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted that he did not look to the north to see if any traffic was approaching. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 turning into the path of V2 (the 1995 Plymouth Neon), causing the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly check for approaching traffic and ensure it was safe to make the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
