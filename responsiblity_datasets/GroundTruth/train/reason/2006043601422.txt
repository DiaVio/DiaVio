The driver of V1 stated that he was unable to avoid colliding with V2 (the 1999 Lexus RX) because another truck suddenly changed lanes, revealing the stopped vehicle in V1's lane. However, the critical reason for the critical event involving V1 was coded as "driver inattention." This suggests that the driver of V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road conditions and the vehicles ahead, which ultimately led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention.
