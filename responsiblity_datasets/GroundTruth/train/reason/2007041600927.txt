The reason for this is that V1 was witnessed running a red light and entering the intersection, causing the collision with V2. Additionally, there were skid marks on the roadway indicating that V1 attempted to stop prior to entering the intersection, further suggesting that V1 was at fault. Furthermore, V1 fled the scene, which is an illegal maneuver. On the other hand, V2 was in the northbound left turn-only lane with a green arrow, indicating that V2 had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that he heard a screech and saw V1 running the red light, leaving him with no opportunity to avoid the crash. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light and causing the collision.
