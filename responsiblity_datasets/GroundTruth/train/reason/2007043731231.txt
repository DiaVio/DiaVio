The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as indicated by the BAC of .14. This impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle and make appropriate decisions while driving. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a high speed of 89 kmph (55 mph), which was too fast for the turn onto the ramp. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's impaired state, led to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent crash into the guardrail.
