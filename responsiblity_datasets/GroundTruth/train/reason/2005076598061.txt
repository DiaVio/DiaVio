The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the rear of V2 (the 2001 Ford Windstar) while it was slowing down to let a pedestrian cross the road. This indicates that V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead and did not react in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating," suggesting that V1 was aware of V2 slowing down but still failed to stop in time. Therefore, V1's lack of attention and failure to maintain a safe following distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
