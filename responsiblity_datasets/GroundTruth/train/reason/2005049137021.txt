The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left-hand turn into a residential driveway, crossing the path of V1. The driver of V2 did not see V1 and did not take any evasive action prior to the impact. Additionally, the driver of V2 was distracted by looking to his left for a parking space across the street, instead of paying attention to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and being distracted by an external factor contributed to the collision, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
