The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to execute a left turn from the northbound left turn lane, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1995 four-door Ford Bronco, which was traveling eastbound in the far right straight lane. V1 entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 rotated counter clockwise 60 degrees after the initial impact, indicating that V1 was likely at fault for not properly yielding and causing the collision.
