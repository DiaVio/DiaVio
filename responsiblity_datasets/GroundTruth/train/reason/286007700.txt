The reason for this is that V1 crossed the center line into the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2004 Ford E350 Econoline commercial van, resulting in a frontal impact. V1's movement across the center line indicates a failure to maintain their lane and adhere to traffic regulations. This action directly caused the collision with V2 and subsequent injuries to the occupants.
