The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep prior to the crash, and this was confirmed by the critical pre-crash event coding, which indicated that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. Additionally, the blood tests for the driver of V1 indicated the ingestion of substances (amphetamine, benzodiazepine, and THC) that could impair driving ability. Therefore, V1's actions of falling asleep and potentially being under the influence of substances contributed to the accident.
