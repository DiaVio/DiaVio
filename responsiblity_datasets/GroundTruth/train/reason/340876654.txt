The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center-line while attempting to pass the case vehicle on the left, resulting in the front of V2 striking the left side of the case vehicle. This indicates that V2 was not maintaining a safe distance and failed to yield the right of way to the case vehicle, causing the collision.
