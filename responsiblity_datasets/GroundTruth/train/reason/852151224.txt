The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to pass V1 in the opposite westbound lane while V1 was slowing down to make a left turn into a driveway. V2 locked up the brakes and left skid marks in the westbound lane before colliding with the left side of V1. This indicates that V2 was not able to stop or avoid the collision, suggesting that V2 was not exercising proper caution and failed to yield to V1's turning maneuver.
