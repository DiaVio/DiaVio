The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the critical event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." This indicates that V2 was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the road conditions, which included construction zone warning signs. Additionally, the driver-related factor of "following too closely to respond to unexpected actions" suggests that V2 was not maintaining a safe distance from V1, which contributed to the accident. It is important to note that V1's avoidance maneuver was a result of the large truck attempting to change lanes, which caused V1 to steer left off the roadway. However, V2's decision to also steer left into the median to avoid the large truck ultimately led to the collision with V1. Therefore, V2's actions of traveling too fast for conditions and following too closely are the primary factors that led to the accident.
