The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to not looking to see if the light was green or not, indicating inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling between 31-40 mph, exceeding the posted speed limit of 25 mph. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and failed to adhere to traffic laws, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1993 Pontiac Bonneville).
