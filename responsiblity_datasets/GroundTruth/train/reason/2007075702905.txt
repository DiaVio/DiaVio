The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize that her traffic light was red instead of green, causing her to enter the intersection when it was not safe to do so. Additionally, V1 did not observe the presence of V2 (the driver of the 2002 Ford Taurus) until just prior to impact. Furthermore, based on the post-crash vehicle trajectories, V1 was traveling at a much higher rate of speed than V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to obey the traffic signal make her primarily responsible for the accident.
