The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to looking left and right for oncoming traffic but failed to notice V2 approaching from the north. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surroundings. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "inadequate surveillance." These factors further support the conclusion that V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle led to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord LX) does not bear primary responsibility for the accident. While V2 was involved in the crash, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroaching from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." This suggests that V2 was already in the intersection when V1 turned left in front of them, indicating that V2 had the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
