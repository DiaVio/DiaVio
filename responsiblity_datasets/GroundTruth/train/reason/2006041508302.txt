The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a sudden control loss, causing the vehicle to rotate and make contact with the guardrail. The driver stated that he felt the vehicle pulling to the right in a clockwise direction, and observed the steering wheel spinning on him. He also mentioned finding a large plastic wrap twisted tightly around the rotor of his left rear wheel the next day, which he believed caused the control loss. While the presence of road debris (the plastic wrap) may have contributed to the control loss, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle. The driver did not report any other factors such as hydroplaning or braking, and stated that he had both hands on the wheel prior to the incident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
