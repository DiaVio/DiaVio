The driver of V-1 was attempting to make an illegal left turn into a convenience store, which is a violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver put V-1 in the path of V-2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Tahoe), resulting in the collision. The driver of V-2 was traveling in the designated right turn lane, following the rules of the road. The congestion and sight line restrictions caused by the backed-up traffic may have contributed to the accident, but ultimately, it was the illegal left turn by V-1 that led to the collision. Therefore, V-1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their illegal maneuver of making a left turn where it was prohibited.
