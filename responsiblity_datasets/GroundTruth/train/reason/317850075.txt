The reason for this is that V1 drifted left and crossed over the left lane line, entering the center turn lane where V2 (the 2012 Chevrolet Equinox) was traveling straight. V1 made contact with the front right of V2, indicating that V1 was in the wrong lane and failed to yield to oncoming traffic in the center turn lane. This action caused the collision and subsequent rotation of both vehicles.
