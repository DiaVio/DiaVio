The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions. This is evident from the fact that V1 was traveling at 60 mph on a ramp with a posted speed limit of 70 mph, which indicates that the driver was exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, V1's loss of control and subsequent overcompensation while trying to avoid another vehicle led to the rollover and crash. While there is a mention of possible side effects of prescribed medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol, it is not explicitly stated that these side effects contributed to the driver's loss of control. Therefore, the primary responsibility still lies with V1 for traveling too fast for the conditions and overcompensating during the avoidance maneuver.
