The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, which resulted in V1 turning across the path of V2 (the 1996 Honda Civic). V1's driver claimed to have stopped and looked, but a witness stated that V1 did not look and only stopped briefly. Additionally, V1's driver suffers from epilepsy and is on medication, which may have affected her ability to properly surveil the intersection. On the other hand, V2's driver reported that he did not see V1 turning until just a second before impact and was unable to avoid the collision, despite braking without lockup. While V2's driver was fatigued and experiencing work-related stress, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to properly surveil the intersection and turning across the path of V2.
