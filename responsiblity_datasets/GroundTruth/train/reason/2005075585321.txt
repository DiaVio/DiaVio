The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others, specifically V2 slowing down and attempting to change lanes to avoid V3. V1 was unable to slow down enough to avoid colliding with V2, which ultimately led to the subsequent collision with V3. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 had several health issues, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and a "bad back," and was taking prescription medications regularly. The driver also reported difficulty sleeping and feeling fatigued, having slept less than five hours the night before the crash. These factors may have contributed to the driver's reduced ability to respond effectively to the situation on the road. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their excessive speed and inability to respond to the actions of other vehicles.
