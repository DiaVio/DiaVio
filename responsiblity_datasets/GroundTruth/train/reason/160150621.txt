The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north on the three-lane, two-way roadway, and V1, the 2005 Toyota Prius, was driving westbound on the two-lane, one-way roadway. Both vehicles entered the intersection, and the front of V1 made contact with the right side of V2. Since V2 was traveling on the roadway that had the right of way, it had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V2 failed to yield to V1, resulting in the collision.
