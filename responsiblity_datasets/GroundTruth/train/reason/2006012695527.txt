The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 failed to properly observe the approaching westbound vehicle (V2) before initiating the left turn. Despite having a blinking red turn signal, the driver of V1 did not exercise due diligence in ensuring that it was safe to proceed with the turn. This lack of attention and failure to properly survey the intersection led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the witness testimony supports the claim that the driver of V1 was distracted by a cell phone conversation at the time of the crash. This further demonstrates the driver's inattention and failure to prioritize safe driving practices. Therefore, based on the inadequate surveillance, inattention, and distraction by a cell phone conversation, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
