The reason for this is that V1 made a right turn out of the gas station driveway and crossed over three travel lanes into the path of V2, the Mitsubishi Eclipse. V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic and did not properly assess the situation before making the turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that he only gave a cursory glance to the left before pulling out of the driveway. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was identified as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 encroached into the adjacent lane while making the turn. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and encroachment into the path of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
