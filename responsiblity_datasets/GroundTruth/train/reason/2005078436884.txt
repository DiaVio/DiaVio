The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Although the driver looked to his left, he did not look to the right, where V2 (the 1996 Mazda Protégé) was approaching from. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 driving through the intersection and colliding with the left side of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle from the right side makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
