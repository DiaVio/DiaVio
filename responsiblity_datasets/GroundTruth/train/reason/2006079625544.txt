The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, leading to the decision to turn left during the yellow phase of the traffic signal. This misjudgment ultimately resulted in the collision with V2. While the driver of V2 could have potentially taken more caution and anticipated V1's turn, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making the incorrect decision to turn without ensuring a safe gap or sufficient time to complete the turn.
