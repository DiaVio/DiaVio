The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and were traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. Despite seeing the vehicles stopped in lane one, V1 attempted to merge into the adjacent left lane but was unable to do so due to another vehicle merging into that lane. As a result, V1 applied the brakes but skidded into the rear of V2, causing the subsequent chain reaction collision with V3. In summary, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and inability to respond to the unexpected actions of others led to the crash.
