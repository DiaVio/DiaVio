The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was the one that departed the right pavement edge, resulting in the frontal area and undercarriage impacting a ditch culvert. This initial event caused Vehicle 1 to rotate counterclockwise and continue in a northeasterly direction, subsequently causing the side surfaces to strike a chain-link fence, a utility pole, and a telephone junction box. These subsequent impacts were minor in nature and likely produced little to no kinematic response from the occupant. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 1, specifically the departure from the pavement edge and subsequent rotation, led to the series of events that caused the accident.
