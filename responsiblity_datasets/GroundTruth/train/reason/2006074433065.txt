The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and did not adequately surveil the road ahead. This is supported by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which is "inadequate surveillance." Additionally, V1 stated that the signal was green and could not understand why the other vehicles stopped. This suggests that V1 may not have been paying attention to the traffic signal or the actions of the vehicles in front of them. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inadequate surveillance are the primary factors that led to the accident.
