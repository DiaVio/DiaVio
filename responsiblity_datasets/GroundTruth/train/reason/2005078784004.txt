The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about V2's actions. V1 attempted to pass V2 on the left, crossing the double yellow lane line, without realizing that V2 was actually turning left at the intersection. This decision to illegally pass and the act of aggressive driving led to the collision between the left side of V2 and the right side of V1.
