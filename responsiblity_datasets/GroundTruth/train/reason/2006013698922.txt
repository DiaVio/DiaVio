The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that he overcorrected when his vehicle started to slide, causing it to cross the centerline and collide with V2. This indicates a driver-related performance error of overcompensation. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not being totally comfortable with the vehicle, suggesting inexperience. Furthermore, the associated factor of traveling too fast for conditions indicates that the driver of V1 did not realize the caution required due to the slick road conditions. On the other hand, V2 (the 2000 Chevy Blazer) was not found to have contributed to the crash. The driver of V2 applied her ABS when she saw V1 spinning sideways into her lane, but due to the slick roads, she was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcorrection, inexperience, and failure to adjust speed for the road conditions.
