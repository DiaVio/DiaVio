The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a decision error by engaging in aggressive driving behavior. The driver admitted to attempting to pull out fast in front of approaching traffic, which led to the tires spinning and the loss of control of the vehicle. This decision, combined with the driver's inexperience and the heavy traffic, ultimately resulted in the crash.
