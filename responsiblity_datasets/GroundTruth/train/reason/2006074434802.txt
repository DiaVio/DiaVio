The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which caused the vehicle to depart the road and ultimately collide with the embankment and utility pole. This indicates that the driver failed to adjust their speed according to the posted advisory speed limit and the road conditions, leading to the loss of control and the subsequent crash.
