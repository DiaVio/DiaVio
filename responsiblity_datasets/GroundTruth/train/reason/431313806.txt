The reason for this is that V1 lost control on the icy roadway, traveled off the south road edge, and onto a gravel driveway before impacting a tree with its front bumper. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle in the snowy and icy conditions, leading to the crash.
