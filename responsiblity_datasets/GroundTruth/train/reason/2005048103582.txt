The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and made an error by being on their cell phone while driving. This distraction caused V1 to steer sharply to the right, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two (V2) in lane one. V1 then crossed multiple lanes and ultimately collided with the cement barrier wall. Although the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" and the critical reason was not attributed to V2, the lack of information about V2 and the fact that V2 did not stop for the crash makes it difficult to assign primary responsibility to V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and error while attempting to avoid a collision.
