The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed its travel lane to the left, resulting in a collision with the impact attenuator. This initial impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and subsequently rollover multiple times before coming to a rest. The driver of V1 sustained serious injuries, indicating that the actions of V1 were the main contributing factor to the accident.
