The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see V2 approaching before making the left turn, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while making the left turn.
