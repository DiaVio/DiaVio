The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1987 Mazda B2000 pickup truck). This resulted in a collision between the front left areas of both vehicles. The impact caused severe damage to Vehicle 1 and both vehicles rotated counter-clockwise before coming to rest. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not wearing a seatbelt, despite claiming to be belted. The lack of restraint use is evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seatbelt system. This indicates that the driver was not properly restrained at the time of the collision. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the lack of seatbelt use, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
