The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reaching down to pick up cigarettes and a lighter from the floorboard, which caused V1 to depart the roadway and strike the guardrail. This internal distraction was identified as the critical reason for the accident. Additionally, the driver had ingested Methadone less than forty-five minutes before the crash, which may have impaired their ability to operate the vehicle safely.
