The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before proceeding. This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event for V2, which states "this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection" and the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event, which is coded as "inadequate surveillance". V1 (the Chevrolet Camaro) was traveling southbound in lane one and had the right of way. The driver of V1 reported that V2 pulled out in front of him and he could not stop in time. However, since V2 was making a left turn, it was their responsibility to ensure that it was safe to proceed before turning. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
