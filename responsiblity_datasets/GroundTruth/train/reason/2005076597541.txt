The reason for this is that V1 was backing down the center turn lane and entered the second westbound lane, which is a violation of traffic rules. This action caused V1 to encroach into the path of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Ford Aspire sedan), resulting in the collision. Since V1 was backing down the center turn lane and departed her lane, it indicates a driver error on her part. The specific reason for this behavior is unknown, as the driver was not interviewed. However, regardless of the reason, V1's actions were in violation of traffic regulations and contributed to the accident.
