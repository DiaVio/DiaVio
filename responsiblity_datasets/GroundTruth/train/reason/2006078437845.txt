The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that impacted the rear of V2 (the Chevrolet K-2500). V1 was making a left turn to cross the bridge, indicating that V1 was the one changing lanes or merging into the flow of traffic. It is the responsibility of the driver making the lane change or merging maneuver to ensure that it is safe to do so and to yield to any oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," suggesting that V1 failed to notice or react to the stopped vehicle (V2) in front of them. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
