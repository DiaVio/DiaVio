The driver of V1 made a false assumption about the intentions of V2 and proceeded with a left turn without correctly judging V2's actions. This decision error led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area and was distracted by the unexpected instruction from the passenger to turn. These factors contributed to the driver's inability to properly assess the situation and avoid the accident.
