The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 128 kmph (80 mph), which was above the posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol with a BAC level of .128, which impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. These factors, along with the witness statement that the driver appeared to be out of control, indicate that V1 was primarily responsible for the crash.
