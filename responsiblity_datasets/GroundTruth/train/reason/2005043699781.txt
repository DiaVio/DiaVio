The reason for V2's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance of the oncoming vehicles. V2 failed to properly assess the traffic conditions before crossing the roadway, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, V2's view of V1 was obstructed by a non-contact vehicle, which further contributed to the inadequate surveillance. The driver of V2 also had family issues on his mind and was unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have affected his ability to make a safe crossing.
