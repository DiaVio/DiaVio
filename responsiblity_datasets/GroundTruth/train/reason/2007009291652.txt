The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by steering to the right over the lane/shoulder line onto the slick, muddy roadside in an attempt to avoid a potential collision with another vehicle. This incorrect evasive action caused V1 to lose control and ultimately crash into a sign and a tree. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions and the hazardous road. The posted speed limit for the curve was 64 kmph (40 mph), but the radius of curvature of the curve should have limited the speed to no more than 48 kmph (30 mph). This indicates that V1 was exceeding the safe speed for the curve, further contributing to the driver's decision error and loss of control. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error, incorrect evasive action, and traveling too fast for the conditions and the curve.
