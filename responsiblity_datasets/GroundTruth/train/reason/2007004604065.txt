The reason for this is that V1 lost traction on the icy road surface and crossed the centerline, entering the southbound travel lane and ultimately leaving the roadway. Despite the driver's attempt to regain control by applying the brakes, the truck continued to slide and ended up in a ditch. The critical pre-crash event and critical reason for V1 were both related to the poor road conditions caused by the icy surface. The driver should have been aware of the hazardous conditions and adjusted their driving accordingly, such as reducing speed or taking extra precautions. However, the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane indicates a lack of proper care and responsibility, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
