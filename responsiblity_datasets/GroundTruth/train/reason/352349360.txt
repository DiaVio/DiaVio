The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 experienced a medical event, causing her to drift left and into the left turn lane while traveling east. This resulted in Vehicle 1 colliding with the median wall and subsequently rolling over. The driver's medical event and resulting loss of control of the vehicle led to the accident.
