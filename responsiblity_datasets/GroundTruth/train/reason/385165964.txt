The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, intending to continue traveling southbound. However, it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2008 International Model 4300 heavy/medium truck), which was traveling north and intended to cross through the intersection. As a result, Vehicle 1's front left plane struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection when it was not safe to do so. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
