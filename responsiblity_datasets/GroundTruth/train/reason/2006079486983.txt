The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted a left turn across the center double-yellow lane lines into a private driveway, without having a clear view of V2's presence due to the obstructed view created by the non-contact vehicles in front of him. This decision to turn with an obstructed view is considered a driver decision error, which ultimately led to the collision.
