The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she initiated a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so. She stated that she did not see V2 (the driver of the Ford Bronco) due to sun glare, but it is the responsibility of the turning driver to ensure that the path is clear before making a left turn. V2 noticed V1 turning into her path and attempted to steer to the right to avoid the collision, indicating that V2 was aware of V1's actions and took evasive measures. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
