The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed over the left lane line and entered the opposing lane, resulting in a head-on collision with V2. The driver of V1 was distracted and admitted to potentially looking down and brushing something off her shirt at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that there were very few lane markings, which may have contributed to the confusion. The driver's medical conditions and use of prescription medications were also factors that could have affected her ability to safely operate the vehicle.
