The driver of V1 admitted to not being able to stop in time and acknowledged that he may have been following too closely to the vehicle in front of him. The critical reason for the critical event was a driver-related recognition error and driver inattention. Although the driver stated that he was not distracted at the time of the crash, his admission of following too closely suggests that he failed to maintain a safe distance and react in time to the sudden stop of V2. Additionally, the presence of a pre-existing health condition and the use of prescription medication for high blood pressure may have contributed to the driver's recognition error and inability to stop in time. V2 (the Ford Windstar) cannot be determined as primarily responsible due to the lack of interview data and the critical reason for the critical event not being coded to this vehicle.
