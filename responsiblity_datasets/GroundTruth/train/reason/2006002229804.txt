The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. This is evident from the fact that V1 began to skid and rotate, ultimately losing control and leaving the roadway. The driver's failure to adjust their speed to the conditions resulted in the loss of control and subsequent crash.
