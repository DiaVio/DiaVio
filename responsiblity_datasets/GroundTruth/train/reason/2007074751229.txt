The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 was distracted by looking at and talking to her passenger, as well as looking at the boys off the right side of the road. This distraction caused her to not see V1, which was stopped in the travel lane. Additionally, the driver of V2 had only one year of driving experience at the time of the crash, which may have contributed to her inability to react in time to avoid the collision.
