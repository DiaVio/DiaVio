The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 ran a red light, as indicated by the officer's observation and the vehicle damage. This illegal maneuver caused Vehicle #1, which had a green arrow, to collide with the right side of Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 reported being unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to stop at the red light.
