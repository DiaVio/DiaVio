The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead. The driver admitted to glancing into her rearview mirror and then looking forward again, but she did not see V2 (the Jaguar XKR) stopped in front of her until after she looked back forward. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to look far enough ahead, which led to the collision. Additionally, V1's driver reported that she applied her brakes but was unable to stop before hitting V2. This suggests that V1 was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the congested traffic conditions, as the driver was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, failure to look far enough ahead, and potentially excessive speed.
