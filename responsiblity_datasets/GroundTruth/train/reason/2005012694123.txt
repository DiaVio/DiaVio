The reason for this is that V1 was changing lanes into lane 1 without realizing that V2 (1991 Buick Century) was slowing down to make a right turn. V1's driver stated that he looked over his right shoulder to check for clearance before executing the lane change, but failed to see V2 stopped in front of him. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1's driver. Additionally, an associative factor for V1 is that the driver assumed that V2 would continue to proceed, which further contributed to the collision.
