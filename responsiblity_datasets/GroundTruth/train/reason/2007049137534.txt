The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. The driver stated that they stopped for 1-2 seconds prior to entering the intersection but did not see V2 (the 1999 Ford F-150) before the crash. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to look or look carefully enough before proceeding into the intersection. While V2's driver also had an associated factor of inadequate surveillance, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment-from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 was already in the intersection when V1 collided with it, indicating that V1 had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to V2.
