The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 while V2 was stopped behind two non-contact vehicles at the intersection. V1's distraction of plugging his cell phone charger into the adapter just prior to the collision indicates a lack of attention to the road and failure to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, V1's speed of 40 kmph (25 mph) in a 72 kmph (45 mph) zone suggests that V1 may have been traveling too fast for the conditions, especially considering the wet roads due to snow. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
