The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 lost control of the vehicle and went into a counterclockwise rotation, crossing over into the northbound travel lane where Vehicle 1 (the 2002 Honda Civic) was traveling. Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck Vehicle 2's right side (rear quarter panel), indicating that Vehicle 2 was in the wrong lane at the time of impact. Additionally, Vehicle 2 continued to rotate and ultimately collided with a fence on the east side of the roadway, further indicating a lack of control and responsibility on the part of the driver of Vehicle 2.
