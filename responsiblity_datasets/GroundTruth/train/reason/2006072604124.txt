The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related error by being externally distracted. The driver's focus on the water splashing onto her windshield and her attempt to change lanes while driving through a large puddle led to a loss of control of the vehicle. This indicates a lack of attention and proper judgment on the part of the driver, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
