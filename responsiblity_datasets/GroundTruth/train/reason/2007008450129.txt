The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a higher than posted speed on a curvy uphill road. The driver lost control of the vehicle while trying to navigate the curve, which indicates that the speed was too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver's attempt to correct the vehicle's position by steering right and then left further contributed to the loss of control. Although it is mentioned that the curve does not meet AASHTO specifications, the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the posted limit is the main factor in this accident.
