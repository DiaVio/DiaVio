The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a left turn at the intersection, which required him to yield on a green light. However, it is mentioned that the driver of V2 may have misjudged the closing speed of V1 and attempted to beat V1 through the intersection. This indicates a potential error in judgment on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, the lack of a complete interview with the driver of V2 prevents any further associated factors from being coded to him, further supporting the primary responsibility of V2.
