The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway on the left side into the median, causing the vehicle to overturn and ultimately resulting in the driver's death. The critical pre-crash event was coded as V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating that the driver made an error in maintaining control of the vehicle. Since there were no environmental factors or sight line restrictions that contributed to the crash, and no other vehicles involved, the responsibility falls on V1 and the driver's actions.
