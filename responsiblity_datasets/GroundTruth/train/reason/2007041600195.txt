The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and collided with the left rear side of V2, which was traveling southbound in lane one. V1's failure to stop at the stop sign indicates a violation of traffic rules and a lack of adequate surveillance. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the stop sign and stated that she never saw V2 prior to the collision. This suggests a failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1's driver was cited for the crash for failure to stop at a traffic control device. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident. On the other hand, V2's driver was traveling at the speed limit and attempted to accelerate to the right to avoid V1, but was unable to do so. The driver of V2 was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as the critical reason was not coded to her. In summary, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
