The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making a left turn. This is evident from the fact that V1 entered the intersection when V2 (the Lincoln LS sedan) was already passing through, resulting in a head-on collision. While V2's driver made a false assumption that V1 would yield the right of way, the critical reason for the accident, inadequate surveillance, is attributed to V1. V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and ensure it was safe to make the left turn ultimately led to the collision.
