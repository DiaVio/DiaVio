The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to stepping on the gas pedal instead of the brake, which caused the vehicle to drive off the roadway to the left and collide with the curb, roadway sign, and light pole. This indicates a performance error on the part of the driver, specifically a failure to properly control the vehicle's speed and braking. Additionally, the police report mentioned "unsafe speed," suggesting that the driver was traveling at a speed that was not appropriate for the wet and rainy conditions. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance error and failure to adjust speed according to the road and weather conditions.
