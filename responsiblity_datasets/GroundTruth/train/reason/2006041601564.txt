The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a decision error by choosing the wrong direction to go around the debris in the roadway. Instead of steering away from the debris, she steered into lane three, directly in the path of V2 (the 1996 International truck). This incorrect evasive action led to the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued due to not having slept and being up all night partying and dancing. This fatigue likely contributed to her slowed reaction time and impaired judgment, further increasing her responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 International truck) attempted to avoid the collision by applying his brakes but was unable to do so. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V1's actions of cutting into his lane were unexpected and not directly caused by V2. Therefore, V2 is not considered primarily responsible for the accident.
