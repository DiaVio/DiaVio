The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the gore area and entered the exit lanes in front of V2 (the 1994 Lincoln Town Car), resulting in a collision. V1's inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason code, suggests that the driver failed to properly observe and assess the traffic situation before making the maneuver. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly merge into the exit lanes makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
