The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed over the center lane lines and entered the lane of travel of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1990 Kenworth T600 tractor-trailer. This action caused the front of V1 to collide with the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's airbag and serious injuries to the driver of V1. Additionally, V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, indicating that V2 was in its proper lane of travel. V2's right side subsequently impacted the north guardrail, further supporting V1's responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the level of medical treatment for the child passenger in V1 is unknown, but the fact that the child sustained a facial laceration suggests that the impact was significant. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to crossing over the center lane lines and colliding with V2, resulting in serious injuries to the driver of V1 and potential injuries to the child passenger.
