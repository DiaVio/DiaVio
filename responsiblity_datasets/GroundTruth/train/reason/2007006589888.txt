The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to feeling tired and fatigued, having only slept for 6 hours instead of her usual 8 hours. She also mentioned that she saw the traffic light turning yellow but decided to continue through the intersection, assuming she would make it without any issues. Additionally, she stated that the other vehicle "came from nowhere all of a sudden," indicating that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle 1 is "inadequate surveillance," which aligns with the driver's statement. The associated factors include inadequate surveillance, looking but not seeing, and the snowy roadway conditions. On the other hand, there is no information available regarding the Critical Reason or associated factors for Vehicle 2, as the driver could not be reached for comment. Therefore, based on the available information, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to the right of way.
