The driver of V2 was cited for driving on a suspended license and admitted to being in a hurry. Additionally, she appeared drowsy during the on-scene interview, indicating possible fatigue. These factors suggest that the driver of V2 was not fully attentive and may have been driving recklessly. Furthermore, V2 had a tire deficiency with mismatched tires and low tread on the left front tire, which could have contributed to the driver's loss of control. While the driver of V1 mentioned a willow tree partially blocking her line of sight, she stopped at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection after not seeing any oncoming traffic. Therefore, the driver of V1 followed the appropriate traffic rules and did not contribute significantly to the crash. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driving on a suspended license, being in a hurry, possible fatigue, and a tire deficiency.
