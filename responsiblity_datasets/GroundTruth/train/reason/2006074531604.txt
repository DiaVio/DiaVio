The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Dodge Caravan, failed to yield the right of way to V1, the Ford Focus, which was already in the intersection. V2 proceeded into the intersection without ensuring that it was clear, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 made a false assumption about the actions of V1, as they did not notice that V1 had changed lanes to avoid the bus. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and false assumption of other's actions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
