The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the wet conditions and failed to negotiate the right turn at the intersection. This is evident from the fact that V1 started to rotate clockwise and departed the roadway, ultimately rolling onto its top and colliding with a utility pole and fence. The critical precrash event of vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, along with the driver-related factor of "too fast for curve/turn," clearly indicates that V1 was at fault for the accident.
