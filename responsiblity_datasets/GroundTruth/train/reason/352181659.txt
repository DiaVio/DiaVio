The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the southbound lane of the north/south roadway and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was attempting to turn left at the intersection. Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 did not properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic before entering the intersection.
