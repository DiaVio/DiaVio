The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection. The driver's recognition error and external distraction, caused by looking at street signs for an intended turn destination, led to inadequate surveillance and unfamiliarity with the roadway. Additionally, the driver's use of prescription medication to control high blood pressure may have contributed to the recognition error. While V2 (the Toyota T-100) did not have a stop sign and proceeded through the intersection, the driver's inadequate surveillance by failing to look ahead to either side as he approached the intersection was an associated factor. However, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign is the primary cause of the accident.
