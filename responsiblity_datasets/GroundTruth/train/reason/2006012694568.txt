The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. V2 stated that he looked left, right, left, but did not see the westbound vehicle in lane two. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming vehicle. Additionally, V2 admitted to being inattentive and engaged in conversation with his family, which further contributed to his inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V2's failure to properly observe the intersection and exercise caution while making a left turn makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
