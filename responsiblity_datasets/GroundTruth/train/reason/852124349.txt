The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it swerved to the right and made no contact with the stopped semi truck in the westbound lane. V1 then lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise, causing the trailer to slide laterally and fully depart off the roadway. V1 then returned to the paved roadway and rolled over, ultimately coming to a rest partially on the north shoulder and off the edge of the roadway. This sequence of events suggests that V1's actions, such as swerving and losing control, were the main contributing factors to the rollover crash.
