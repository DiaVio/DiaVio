The driver of Vehicle One admitted to being distracted by looking at a pedestrian right before the crash. This external distraction caused the driver to fail to yield the right of way to Vehicle Two (2001 Saturn SC), which was already in the intersection. Therefore, Vehicle One's driver-related factor of external distraction and failure to yield to the right of way of Vehicle Two led to the collision.
