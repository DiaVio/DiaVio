The driver of V1 was attempting to turn left at the intersection and failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that she saw herself clear of a car in the first lane but did not see the car in the second lane that struck her before she could react. The driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to see the approaching vehicle in the second lane led to the collision.
