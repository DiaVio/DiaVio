The reason for this is that V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down to read his directions, which caused him to misjudge the distance between his vehicle and V2 (the 2000 Toyota Camry) in front of him. Despite attempting to avoid the collision by applying his brakes, V1 was unsuccessful and ended up rear-ending V2, which then pushed V2 into V3 (the 2001 Ford E-250 van). V1's distraction and misjudgment of the gap distance were critical factors that led to the collision. Additionally, it was noted that V1 was a first-time driver on that road, which may have contributed to his lack of familiarity with the traffic conditions and the appropriate following distance.
