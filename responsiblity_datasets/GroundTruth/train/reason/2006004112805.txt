The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by a vehicle in the opposing lane and was not paying attention to her own lane and what the car in front of her (V2) was doing. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in a social conversation with her passenger, which further contributed to her distraction. Furthermore, the driver of V1 had only been driving for approximately 4 months at the time of the accident, indicating inexperience. Therefore, V1's distraction, lack of attention, and inexperience led to the rear-end collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
