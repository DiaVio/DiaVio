The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high speed of 105 kmph (65 mph) in a posted speed limit zone of 80 kmph (50 mph). Additionally, the driver made an incorrect assumption that V2 (the GMC truck) would clear the roadway before his arrival, leading to a decision error of not checking if lane one was open to avoid the crash by changing lanes. The driver's speeding, lack of familiarity with the roadway and vehicle, and overall driver inexperience are also contributing factors to V1's primary responsibility.
