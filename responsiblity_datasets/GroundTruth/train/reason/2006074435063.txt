The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was physically and mentally impaired by their medical condition (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) and/or the medications used to treat the condition. This impairment likely contributed to the driver's inattention, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver was running late to a doctor's appointment and was thinking and worried about being late, which may have further distracted them from their driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's impaired condition, inattention, and distraction.
