The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, which led to the collision. Despite seeing V2 approaching, the driver of V1 attempted to make the left turn, thinking there was enough time. This misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, an associated factor was the underinflated tires of V1, which may have affected the vehicle's handling and braking capabilities, potentially contributing to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
