The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, which was identified as the critical non-performance factor. This resulted in V1 crossing the centerline and driving directly at the witness vehicle, forcing it off the road. The driver's admission of being really tired and planning to take a nap further supports the fact that she was not alert and capable of safely operating the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's use of cocaine and marijuana may have contributed to her fatigue and impaired driving ability.
