The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it lost control and crossed both eastbound lanes, rode over the barrier curb of a raised median, and struck a traffic light standard. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off its intended path, ultimately causing the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2).
