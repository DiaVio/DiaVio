The driver of Vehicle # 1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. This inadequate surveillance, coupled with possible sight line restrictions caused by parked cars and bushes, led to her not seeing Vehicle # 2 approaching from the southbound lane. As a result, Vehicle # 1 made impact with the front of Vehicle # 2, causing the crash.
