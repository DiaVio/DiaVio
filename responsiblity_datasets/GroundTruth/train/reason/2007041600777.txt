The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed over the lane line and drove into the westbound traffic, causing the collision. The driver admitted to falsely assuming that the road turned into a one-way and believed that the SUV in the westbound lane would yield to him. Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving under a suspended license, which further demonstrates negligence on their part.
