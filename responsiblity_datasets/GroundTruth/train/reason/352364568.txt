The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to avoid a collision with Vehicle 2 (the 1996 Toyota Tercel 2-door coupe) despite attempting to steer right. The front left corner of Vehicle 1 struck the back right corner of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 was at fault for not being able to avoid the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 1 subsequently veered off the roadway, striking a mailbox, a curb, and ultimately a utility pole, indicating a loss of control on the part of the driver.
