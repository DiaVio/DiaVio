The driver of V1 was traveling westbound and encountered congested traffic. Instead of taking appropriate evasive action, such as steering right towards the shoulder, the driver steered left into oncoming traffic, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2 (V2). The driver of V1 failed to recognize the congested traffic due to the bright sun and misjudged the gap distance and speed of the forward traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 tested positive for opiates and cocaine, which may have impaired their judgment and ability to react appropriately. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was traveling eastbound and had no forward traffic congestion. The sun glare was also not a factor for this driver. While the driver of V2 did encroach over the left lane line, the critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that their actions did not contribute significantly to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to incorrect evasive action, impaired judgment, and failure to recognize the congested traffic conditions.
