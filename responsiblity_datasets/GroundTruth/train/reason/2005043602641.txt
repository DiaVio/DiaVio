The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver's sightline was obstructed by vehicles turning into the driveway, but this does not absolve her of the responsibility to ensure it was safe to proceed. Additionally, the driver's inexperience as a 16-year-old with a graduated driver's license may have contributed to her failure to properly assess the situation. V2 (the 1993 Mazda Protégé) attempted to avoid the collision by steering left and locking her brakes, indicating that she took evasive action when she saw V1 turning in front of her. However, V2's actions do not absolve V1 of responsibility for failing to yield the right of way and causing the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way when making a left turn.
