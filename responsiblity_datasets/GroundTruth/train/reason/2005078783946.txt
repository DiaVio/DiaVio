The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, 37 kmph (23 mph) over the posted speed limit, and was also engaging in aggressive driving behavior by passing on the right and making lane changes in front of the vehicle she had just passed. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced and unfamiliar with the capabilities of the vehicle, which contributed to her poor directional control and ultimately led to the loss of control and the accident.
