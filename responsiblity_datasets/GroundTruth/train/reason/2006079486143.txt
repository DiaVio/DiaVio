The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the back of V2 (the 2005 Honda Element SUV). The driver of V1 claimed that her brakes were unresponsive, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the critical precrash event for V1 was attributed to driver-related factors, with the specific type of driver error unknown. On the other hand, V2 was traveling at a constant speed and was impacted from behind by V1. The critical precrash event for V2 was simply another motor vehicle in the lane traveling at a higher speed, which suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and the lack of evidence supporting the claim of brake failure.
