The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they lost control of their vehicle due to poor road conditions (wet road with icy patches). This loss of control caused V1 to move into the opposing travel lane and ultimately collide with V2 (the 1992 Geo Metro). V1's inability to control their vehicle on the icy road is the critical pre-crash event and the critical reason for the crash. V2, on the other hand, was not involved in the first harmful event and their critical pre-crash event was not coded to their vehicle. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the crash.
