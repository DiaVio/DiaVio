The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to observe the traffic slowing down ahead, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. This resulted in the front right area of Vehicle 1 impacting the back left area of Vehicle 2, causing severe damage. The driver of Vehicle 1 was also found to be unrestrained, which suggests a failure to take necessary precautions for safety.
