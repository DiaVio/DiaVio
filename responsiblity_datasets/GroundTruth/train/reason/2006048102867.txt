The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to not realizing that V2 (the black 1999 Mercury Cougar) was stopped. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to maintain a safe following distance and to be aware of the traffic ahead. Additionally, V1's misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed further supports their responsibility for the accident. In contrast, V2 was in the process of making a left turn to go across the road to the produce stand, which suggests that they were not at fault for the collision. The fact that V2's brake lights were reportedly on for the last 9.7 kilometers (6 miles) also indicates that they were taking appropriate measures to signal their intention to slow down or stop. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and their misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed.
