The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it crossed into the north parking lane, drove over the curb, struck two mail box posts, and ultimately collided with a tree in a frontal, small-overlap impact mode on the right side. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the tree.
