The police report indicates that V1 ran a red light, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. This action resulted in the front of V1 striking the right side of V2 (the 1994 Pontiac Bonneville) as it was turning left at the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This suggests that V1 crossed over into the opposite lane, potentially contributing to the collision. However, since no further information is available about the driver of V1, it is difficult to determine the exact reason for this behavior. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection." The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: "false assumption of other's actions." This indicates that the driver of V2 assumed that V1 would stop for its red light and yield the right of way, leading to the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light, while V2's assumption of V1's actions contributed to the collision.
