The reason for this is that V1 was found to be at fault due to a driver-related factor, specifically inattention or daydreaming. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 prior to the crash and stated that she was thinking about her appointment and personal concerns. This indicates a lack of attention and focus on the road, which ultimately led to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chrysler Pacifica) was not found to be primarily responsible for the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. It is important to note that the vision restriction created by the building and trees on the southeast corner of the intersection was an associated factor in this crash, but it does not absolve V1 of responsibility. The primary cause of the crash lies with the driver of V1 and her inattention while driving.
