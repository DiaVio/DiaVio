The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the rainy conditions, as indicated by the officer's estimate of her speed at approximately 72 kmph (45 mph) and her own admission that she was traveling between 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph). Additionally, the fact that three of the vehicle's tires were underinflated suggests a lack of proper maintenance, which could have contributed to the loss of control on the wet roadway. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling too fast for conditions," and the critical reason for this event was the rain/snow environment. The heavy rain and water on the roadway caused the vehicle to hydroplane, resulting in the loss of control and subsequent impact with the guardrail. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driving too fast for the rainy conditions and failing to maintain proper tire inflation.
