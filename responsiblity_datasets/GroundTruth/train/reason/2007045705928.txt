The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the fact that V1 lost traction, rotated clockwise, and departed the right roadside. This resulted in V1 colliding with two trees and coming to rest in a residential yard. Additionally, the presence of alcohol in V1 suggests that the driver may have been impaired, although no test was conducted to confirm this. Furthermore, the tire deficiency with only 1mm of tread depth on each tire indicates that V1 may not have had sufficient traction on the wet road surface, contributing to the loss of control. Overall, V1's acceleration, poor directional control, and potential impairment due to alcohol, along with the tire deficiency, make it primarily responsible for the crash.
