The driver of V1 failed to stop when approaching the intersection and struck the trailer being towed by V2. The driver admitted to being distracted by her dog and taking her eyes off the road. Additionally, she was found to be intoxicated with a BAC of 0.19, had taken Oxycontin for pain, and was emotionally upset. These factors contributed to her poor recognition of the situation and impaired driving ability, making her primarily responsible for the crash.
