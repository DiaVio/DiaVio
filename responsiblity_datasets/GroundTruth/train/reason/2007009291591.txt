The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was speeding on the access road and crossed over the lane line into the path of V2. - V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. - V1 ignored the stop sign at the intersection and continued across the public road, ultimately crashing into a telephone pole. - V1 exhibited aggressive driving behavior, as indicated by the witness's statement of traveling at a high rate of speed and making sharp turns. - V1 had a tire deficiency from a previous impact with a curb, which may have contributed to the loss of control. These factors indicate that V1's actions and behavior were the primary cause of the accident.
