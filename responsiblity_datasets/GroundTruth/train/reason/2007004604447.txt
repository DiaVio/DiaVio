The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at a police motor vehicle stop in his rearview mirror. This external distraction caused the driver to not pay attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2006 Toyota Avalon) that was stopped in traffic waiting to make a left turn. V1 did not attempt any avoidance maneuvers, further indicating the driver's lack of attention and responsibility in the situation.
