The driver of V2 admitted to attempting to merge into lane three while traveling at a high speed of approximately 129 kmph (80 mph). This action of accelerating and steering right caused him to lose control of his vehicle, resulting in the rotation and slide into lane three where the collision with V1 occurred. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions." This indicates that V2 was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the conditions of the road, which was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). Therefore, V2's actions of attempting to merge at a high speed and losing control due to traveling too fast for conditions make them primarily responsible for the crash.
