The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic, including V2, before entering the intersection.
