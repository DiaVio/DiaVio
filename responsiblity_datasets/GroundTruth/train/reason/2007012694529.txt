The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was observed by both the driver of Vehicle #1 and the witness to be traveling at a high rate of speed and moving in and out of traffic, cutting off other vehicles. Vehicle #2 then pushed Vehicle #1 off the roadway, causing the driver of Vehicle #1 to lose control and ultimately crash into the guardrail. Additionally, the witness stated that the driver of Vehicle #2 did not stop after the incident, indicating a lack of responsibility or concern for their actions. Therefore, Vehicle #2's reckless driving behavior and failure to maintain control of their vehicle are the main factors contributing to the crash.
