The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted by using a cell phone while driving, which is a form of internal distraction. This distraction caused her to initially veer off the right side of the road. However, instead of correcting her mistake appropriately, she overcompensated by steering left, resulting in a yaw and ultimately causing the vehicle to leave the left side of the road. The EDR information confirms that there was no braking during the entire pre-crash sequence, indicating that the driver failed to take appropriate actions to prevent the crash. Additionally, the driver was not wearing a seatbelt, which could have mitigated her injuries.
