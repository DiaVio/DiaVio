The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The investigating officer noted that V1 had been in the oncoming lane for quite a distance before drifting off the left side of the roadway. Additionally, the driver's statement that he "must have dozed off" further supports the conclusion that driver fatigue was the main factor in causing the accident.
