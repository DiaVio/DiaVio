The reason for this is that V1 was pulling out of a restaurant parking lot and intended to stop at the intersection before making a left turn. However, the brakes of V1 failed, causing it to enter the right southbound lane on the arterial road and collide with V2 (the 2002 Toyota Highlander). V1's failure to stop and yield the right of way, combined with the fact that the driver was cited for multiple violations (no driver's license, no insurance, improper equipment), indicates that V1's actions were the main cause of the crash.
