The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to avoid a collision with a non-contact recreational vehicle by accelerating and steering to the right, which caused V1 to depart the roadway and lose directional control. This overcompensation by the driver ultimately led to the vehicle rotating and rolling onto its side, resulting in the crash. Therefore, V1's actions of overcompensating and losing control of the vehicle are the main factors that contributed to the crash, making them primarily responsible.
