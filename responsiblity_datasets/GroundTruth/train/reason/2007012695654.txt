The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which resulted in a loss of control when encountering a snowdrift. The driver's excessive speed, combined with overcompensation and unfamiliarity with the roadway, contributed to the crash. Additionally, the low tread on the tires and the slick surface of the roadway further compromised the vehicle's ability to maintain control.
