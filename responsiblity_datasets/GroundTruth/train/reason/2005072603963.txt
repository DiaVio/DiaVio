The reason for this is that the driver of V1 falsely assumed that the bus would stop before the intersection, even though the bus had the right of way. This false assumption led to V1 proceeding straight ahead without yielding to the bus, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was in a hurry and late for work, indicating a possible disregard for traffic rules and a potential factor contributing to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their false assumption and failure to yield to the bus.
