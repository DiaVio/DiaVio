The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound in the number-one lane with the intention of traveling straight through the intersection. V1 (2003 Volkswagen Jetta) came to a stop at the intersection limit line and proceeded into the intersection to make a left turn. V2 struck V1 on the left side (left rear door area), indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1.
