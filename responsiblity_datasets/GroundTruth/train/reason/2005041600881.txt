The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 experienced an epileptic seizure while driving, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and veer off the roadway. The driver's medical condition, low medication levels, and history of seizures indicate that he was aware of the potential risks associated with driving. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle #1 bears responsibility for the crash due to his failure to ensure that he was in a fit condition to operate a vehicle safely.
