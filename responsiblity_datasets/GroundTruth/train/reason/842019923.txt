The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline into the northbound lane, directly into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Toyota 4Runner SR5 4x4 sport utility vehicle), resulting in the collision. This indicates that Vehicle 1 was not able to maintain its lane and caused the accident by entering the opposing lane of traffic.
