The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). Additionally, the presence of trees and a parked vehicle causing a sightline restriction may have contributed to V1's failure to properly assess the situation. It is important to note that there is no further information available for the driver of V2, so their role in the accident cannot be determined.
