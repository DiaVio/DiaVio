The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to make a left turn at the intersection while traveling too fast for the conditions. This resulted in V1 skidding, hitting the curb, and ultimately crashing into landscape timbers. Additionally, the driver was distracted by loud music in the vehicle and was in a hurry, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle properly. Therefore, V1's excessive speed, distracted driving, and lack of familiarity with the vehicle all played a role in causing the crash.
