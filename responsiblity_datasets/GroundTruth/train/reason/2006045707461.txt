The reason for this is that Vehicle #2, a 1990 Lincoln Town Car, was traveling west on the road in the center turn lane and proceeded to make a left turn into the driveway without stopping. This action of turning across the path of oncoming traffic without yielding the right of way resulted in the collision with Vehicle #1. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left" and the Critical Reason was coded as "misjudgment of gap and speed." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #2 failed to accurately assess the distance and speed of oncoming traffic, leading to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the gap and speed of oncoming traffic.
