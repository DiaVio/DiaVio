The reason for this is that V1 made an unsafe lane change directly in front of V2 (the driver of the Volvo XC-70), without providing enough time or space for V2 to react and avoid a collision. This is supported by the statement of V1's daughter, who concurred with V2's account that V1 changed lanes suddenly. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 failed to maintain their lane position and encroached into the adjacent lane, which contributed to the collision. While V2 mentioned that the wet roadway may have contributed to the skidding and control loss, it is important to note that V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction); over right lane line," suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the initial lane change and encroachment. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their unsafe lane change and failure to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic.
