The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling eastbound and approaching the intersection with the intention of passing straight through. - The driver of V1 reported that the tri-light was in the green phase as he approached the intersection. - However, the driver of V1 admitted to drinking alcohol, including four beers on the day of the crash, and had a measured BAC of 0.189. - The driver of V1 also stated that bright lights momentarily blinded him as he entered the intersection. - Despite seeing V2 turning, V1 was unable to avoid the collision and impacted the right side of V2. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and failure to avoid the collision despite having the opportunity to do so make them primarily responsible for the accident.
