The reason for this is that V2 made a right turn at the intersection without noticing V1 (the hit-and-run vehicle) behind her. V2 then crossed into the number two travel lane, where V1 struck the back of V2. This caused V2 to lose control and collide with V3, V4, and V5. Although V1 is responsible for initially striking V2, V2's failure to properly check her surroundings before making the right turn is the main contributing factor to the accident.
