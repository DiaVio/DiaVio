The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 became distracted and failed to notice that Vehicle 1 (V1) had stopped in traffic. This lack of attention led to the front bumper of Vehicle 2 impacting the rear bumper of Vehicle 1. Additionally, after the initial impact, the driver of Vehicle 2 mistakenly reversed instead of braking, resulting in a second impact with the rear of Vehicle 1. These actions indicate negligence on the part of the driver of Vehicle 2, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
