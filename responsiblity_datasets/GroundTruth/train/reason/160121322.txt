The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was involved in a severe right side collision with a tree. The impact with the tree caused various injuries to the case occupant, including a scalp hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal hemorrhage, T1 transverse process fracture, small spleen laceration, facial abrasions, and knee abrasions. These injuries indicate that the driver of V1 was directly affected by the collision and suffered significant harm as a result.
