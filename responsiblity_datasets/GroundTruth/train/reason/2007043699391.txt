The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve, which resulted in the loss of control. Additionally, the driver admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the crash, which impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. The driver's lack of experience with the vehicle, as it was their first time driving it after a long-term overhaul, may have also contributed to the loss of control.
