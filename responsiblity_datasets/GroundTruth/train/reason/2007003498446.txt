V1 swerved into lane two, causing the left side of V1 to strike the right side of V2. This action by V1 resulted in V2 rotating clockwise and rolling onto its left side. The driver of V1 reported that he swerved to avoid another vehicle, which led to the contact with V2 and the subsequent overturning of V2. However, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 was already in violation of proper lane usage before the crash occurred. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from the adjacent lane over the right lane line. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the initial contact with V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which ultimately led to the collision with V2.
