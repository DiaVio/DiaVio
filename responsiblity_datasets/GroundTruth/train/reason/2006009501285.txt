The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal factor, specifically turning her head to address an argument between the passengers. This distraction caused her to lose focus on the road and resulted in V1 departing its lane, entering the shoulder, and ultimately colliding with a light pole. Additionally, the driver admitted to not being confident in the braking and steering capabilities of the vehicle, which could have contributed to her inability to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and lack of confidence in the vehicle's handling.
