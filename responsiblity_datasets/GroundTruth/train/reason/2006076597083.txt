The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep for a split second before the crash and could not remember the events prior to the crash. He also stated that he did not see the stoplight or V2 crossing the intersection. Additionally, V1 entered the intersection against the red traffic control signal. The driver's fatigue and failure to obey traffic signals make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
