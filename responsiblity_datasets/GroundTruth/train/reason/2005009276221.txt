The reason for this is that Vehicle one made a U-turn across the path of Vehicle two (the 1991 Ford Crown Victoria) without yielding or giving the right of way. The driver of Vehicle two stated that he blew his horn and tried to avoid the collision, but Vehicle one continued with the U-turn, resulting in the front of Vehicle two striking the left side of Vehicle one. Since there is no information or interview with the driver of Vehicle one, it is unclear why they made the U-turn without yielding or if there were any extenuating circumstances. However, based on the available information, the driver of Vehicle one's failure to yield and make a safe U-turn is the primary reason for the crash.
