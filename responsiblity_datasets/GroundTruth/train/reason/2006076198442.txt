The reason for this is that V2 was rapidly decelerating in the same lane as V1, which caused V1 to steer right in order to avoid a collision. V2 was slowing down quickly to avoid a pedestrian who was crossing the travel lanes. As a result, V1's rear left side made contact with the rear end of V2. While the critical reason for the pedestrian's presence in the roadway was not coded to V2, it can be inferred that V2's sudden deceleration to avoid the pedestrian created a hazardous situation for V1, leading to the collision.
