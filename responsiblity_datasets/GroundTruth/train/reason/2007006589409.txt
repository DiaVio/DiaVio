The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that she was cut off by another vehicle and steered right to avoid a collision. However, instead of safely maneuvering back onto the roadway, V1 collided with a fence/wall, crossed over oncoming traffic, and struck another fence/wall before coming to a rest. This indicates that V1's driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle after the evasive action, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned being emotionally upset and stressed at work, as well as not taking her prescribed antidepressant medication on the day of the crash. These factors may have contributed to her impaired judgment and ability to handle the situation effectively. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle after evasive action and the potential influence of emotional distress and medication non-compliance.
