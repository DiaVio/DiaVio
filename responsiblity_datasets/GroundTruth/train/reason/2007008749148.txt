The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V1 stated that she looked in both directions but did not see V2 until the impact. However, it was observed that if the vehicle had pulled forward several feet from the stop sign, the view would have been unobstructed. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not take proper precautions to ensure a clear intersection before entering.
