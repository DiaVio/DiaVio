The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the traffic signal at the intersection, which was a critical pre-crash event. Additionally, V2 claimed to have had a seizure and cannot recall any details about the crash, suggesting a potential medical condition that may have impaired his ability to drive safely. Furthermore, the background check on V2's license revealed that he had been involved in eight crashes in the past five years, indicating a pattern of unsafe driving behavior. Therefore, V2's failure to obey the traffic signal and potential medical condition make him primarily responsible for the crash.
