The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at a red light and entered the intersection, causing the collision with V2. The driver admitted to not paying full attention and being preoccupied with personal problems, which led to a recognition error and an illegal maneuver of failing to stop for a traffic control device.
