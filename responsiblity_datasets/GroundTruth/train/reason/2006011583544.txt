The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as evidenced by the hidden bottle of liquor found at the scene. This impaired his ability to maintain control of his vehicle and stay within his lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by attempting to re-enter his original lane of travel after drifting into the oncoming lane. This action caused the collision with V2. The driver of V2, on the other hand, was traveling at a reasonable speed and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and incorrect evasive action make them primarily responsible for the crash.
