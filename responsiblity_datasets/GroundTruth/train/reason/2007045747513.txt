The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down at the ashtray and his drink, which caused him to not notice that V2 had stopped in front of him. Despite applying the brakes, V1 was unable to avoid colliding with the rear of V2. This indicates that V1's driver was not maintaining proper surveillance and failed to look far enough ahead, leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's internal distraction and inadequate surveillance.
