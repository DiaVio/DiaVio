The driver of V1 was making a left turn across traffic at the T-intersection without adequate surveillance. This means that the driver failed to properly check for oncoming traffic before making the turn. As a result, V1 was struck on the right side by Vehicle Two (V2), which was traveling straight in its lane. V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and properly assess the situation led to the collision.
