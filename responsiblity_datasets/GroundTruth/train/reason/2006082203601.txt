The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 (the 1998 Honda Accord), indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating," suggesting that V1 was aware of V2's deceleration but still failed to react appropriately. It is important to note that without further information or interviews with the drivers, it is difficult to determine the exact factors contributing to the driver error of V1. However, based on the available information, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react to V2's deceleration makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
