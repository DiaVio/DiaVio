The reason for V1's responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." Additionally, the critical reason for the event was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for conditions - snow/ice on roadway." This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed that was not appropriate for the icy and snowy road conditions. As a result, V1 lost control of the vehicle and slid off the road, ultimately colliding with a railroad tie fence. Since V1 was the vehicle that lost control and was traveling too fast for the conditions, it is primarily responsible for the crash.
