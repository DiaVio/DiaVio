The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 ran a red light at the intersection, as concluded by the police report. The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not recognize that other vehicles in their direction of travel were stopped for the red light. This failure to recognize the red light and the assumption that they had a green light led to the collision with V2. V2, on the other hand, followed a vehicle in front of them that passed through the intersection. While V2's driver made a false assumption that V1 would stop at the red light, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for running the red light. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their disregard for the stop and go signal.
