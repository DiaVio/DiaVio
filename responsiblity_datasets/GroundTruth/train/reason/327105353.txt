The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that it slowed down to make a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This action caused the driver of the case vehicle (V1) to attempt to steer right to go around V2, resulting in the collision between the left fender of V1 and the right-rear corner of V2.
