The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the westbound travel lane and intended to cross through the intersection, while Vehicle 2, the 2003 Mercedes-Benz E320 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound and intended to turn left at the intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, resulting in the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 striking the frontal plane of Vehicle 2. Since Vehicle 1 was crossing through the intersection, it had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic, including Vehicle 2. Therefore, Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way, leading to the collision.
