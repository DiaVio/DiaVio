The driver of V-1 was traveling in the number 2 lane when the left side wheels struck the rumble and the tires departed the left side of the roadway. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident was determined to be driver-related, specifically the driver being asleep at the time of the crash. The fact that the driver woke up approximately 22 hours before the crash suggests that he may have been fatigued or sleep-deprived, which likely impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Fatigue can significantly impact a driver's reaction time, decision-making, and overall alertness, increasing the risk of accidents. Therefore, V-1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the critical factor of being asleep while driving.
