The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. She did not look to her right, which resulted in her not seeing V1 approaching from the northbound lane. This lack of surveillance led to her accelerating and almost completely crossing the intersection when she was struck by V1. Additionally, associated factors such as the driver's physical conditions of hypertension and high cholesterol, as well as the use of prescription medications, may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and overall ability to safely operate the vehicle.
