The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 became distracted, possibly by oncoming headlights, and allowed the vehicle to track diagonally out of the number-one lane, resulting in a frontal impact with a parked semi-trailer. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and failed to stay within their lane, leading to the collision.
