The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 drifted off the west edge of the roadway and attempted to steer back into the southbound lane. However, this action resulted in a counterclockwise yaw, crossing the center line, and ultimately causing the vehicle to rollover multiple times. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane led to the accident.
