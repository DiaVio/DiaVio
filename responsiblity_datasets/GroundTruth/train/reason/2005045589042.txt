The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was the one that switched lanes to avoid slowing down and subsequently struck the left rear of Vehicle #2 (1996 Chevrolet Blazer). This initial impact caused Vehicle #2 to go into a counterclockwise rotation and collide with Vehicle #3 (2004 Nissan Frontier pickup) before rolling over. Although Vehicle #2 was reported to be traveling between 41-50mph in the left lane and not braking when it was struck, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for making the lane change without being able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. Additionally, a witness reported that the driver of Vehicle #1 had been speeding and weaving through traffic prior to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to careless driving and the inability to respond to the situation appropriately.
