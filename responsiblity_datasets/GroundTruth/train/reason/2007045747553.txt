The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering right to avoid the oncoming non-contact vehicle. Instead of slowing down or stopping, the driver chose an inappropriate and unsuccessful evasive action, which caused V1 to drive off the right side of the road and lose control, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control and overcompensation further contributed to the crash.
