The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he was distracted and not paying attention to the road. He admitted to reaching and looking down inside the vehicle to retrieve a soft drink just prior to the collision. This distraction caused him to fail to decelerate and collide with the back of V2 (the Chrysler Town and Country) as it was slowing down for the signal-controlled intersection. V2 (the 41-year-old female driver) also had some contributing factors, such as inattention due to conversing with her daughter, but the critical reason for the accident was the recognition error and internal distraction of V1.
