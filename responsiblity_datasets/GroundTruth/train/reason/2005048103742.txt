The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) and failed to stop in time to avoid colliding with the stopped V2 (Kia Optima) in front of it. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not maintain a safe following distance or failed to pay attention to the traffic ahead, resulting in the rear-end collision with V2. While V2 was also stopped in lane one, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 may have been impacted by the force of the collision between V1 and V2, causing it to collide with V3 (Nissan Maxima) in front of it. However, V2's primary responsibility is secondary to V1's failure to stop in time.
