The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a decision error by backing up in an inappropriate area. V1 was attempting a 3-point turn by backing across the northbound lane, which is not a safe maneuver to perform in the middle of an intersection. This action created a hazardous situation for other vehicles, including V2. V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Tahoe) was traveling in the northbound lane and had the right of way. V2 attempted to steer left to avoid the impact, but due to the sudden presence of V1's trailer in their path, they were unable to avoid the collision. V2's actions were a reaction to V1's improper backing maneuver. Therefore, V1's decision to back up in an inappropriate area and create a hazardous situation makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
