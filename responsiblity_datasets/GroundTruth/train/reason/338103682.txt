The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was attempting to turn right from a parking lot onto the main thoroughfare and entered the path of Vehicle 1, which was proceeding straight in the southbound lane. Vehicle 2's front left area impacted the right front wheel of Vehicle 1, causing the initial collision. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the accident.
