The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver took his eyes off the road to check the lane to his right, and when he looked back, he found that the traffic ahead was braking. This action of not paying attention to the traffic ahead and failing to look far enough ahead to observe what the forward vehicles were doing led to the collision with the rear of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption that V2 would continue to proceed, indicating a misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead make them primarily responsible for the crash.
