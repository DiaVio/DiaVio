The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she attempted to make a left turn in front of V2 (the 1994 Dodge Dakota) without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 admitted to being unfamiliar with the roadway and not seeing the truck that struck her. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that she failed to properly observe the traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and judgment while making the left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
