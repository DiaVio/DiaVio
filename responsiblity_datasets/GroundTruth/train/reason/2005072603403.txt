The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to not paying full attention and being distracted by looking down in her vehicle prior to the impact. This interior distraction caused her to misjudge the gap and speed of the traffic ahead, resulting in her cutting in front of V2 (the driver of the 2000 Chevrolet Blazer) and causing the collision. Additionally, it was mentioned that the driver of V1 was driving in an aggressive manner prior to the crash, which further supports her responsibility for the accident.
