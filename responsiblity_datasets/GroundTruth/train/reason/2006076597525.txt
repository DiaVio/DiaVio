The driver of V1 made a driver decision error by entering the roadway without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. Despite seeing a large pickup truck in the #1 lane heading south, the driver of V1 failed to notice the small car (V2) coming up in the #2 southbound lane. This resulted in V1 entering the roadway and being impacted by V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the traffic conditions before entering the roadway.
