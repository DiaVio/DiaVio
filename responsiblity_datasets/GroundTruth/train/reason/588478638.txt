The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling in the wrong direction (eastbound in the right westbound travel lane), which directly contributed to the head-on collision with Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 attempted to steer left and brake to avoid the crash, indicating that the driver of Vehicle 1 was taking appropriate evasive action. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 2 for traveling in the wrong direction on the roadway.
