The driver of V1 stated that he was attempting to merge into lane two when he hit some ice and lost control of the vehicle. He admitted that he did not realize how icy the road was and was traveling at a speed of 82-97 kmph (51-60 mph), which was too fast for the icy conditions. Additionally, the driver failed to regain control of the vehicle despite attempting braking and steering left and right. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the icy road conditions and their inability to control the vehicle properly.
