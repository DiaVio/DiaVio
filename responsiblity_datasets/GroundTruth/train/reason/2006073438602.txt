The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior by attempting to pass V2 on the right while both vehicles were heading southbound on the access ramp. V1 then changed lanes to the left without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 crossed both lanes of traffic and ultimately crashed into the center barrier, indicating a lack of control and reckless driving. While V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado) was cited for encroaching over the right lane line, this action alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2 had been driving for about fifteen minutes and was unable to avoid the collision as V1 attempted to pass in front of him. Overall, V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to safely change lanes and maintain control of the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
