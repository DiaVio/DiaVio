The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by either his phone or pager, which caused him to glance down and take his attention away from the road. When he looked back up, he noticed the line of traffic stopped ahead of him and attempted to brake and steer right to avoid hitting V2 (the Ford Ranger). However, his actions were unsuccessful, and V1 ended up colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention on the road.
