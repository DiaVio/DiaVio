The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes without detecting V2, which was located in his blind spot near the right front corner of his vehicle. Despite claiming to have checked his mirrors, V1 did not see V2 and proceeded to change lanes, resulting in the collision. The lack of front mirrors on V1's vehicle is cited as a contributing factor, as mirrors in the front of the vehicle could have helped prevent the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to detect V2 in his blind spot and the lack of front mirrors on his vehicle make him primarily responsible for the accident.
