The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic laws. - V1's driver admitted to not seeing the red light until she was under it, indicating inattention and a failure to observe traffic signals. - V1's driver also admitted to not seeing V2 until it was in front of her, further indicating inattention and a failure to properly surveil the intersection. - The driver of V1 was also taking medications for chronic fatigue syndrome, which can cause side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, and light-headedness, potentially impairing her ability to operate a vehicle safely. It is important to note that the driver of V2 was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol, which is a contributing factor to the accident. However, since V1 ran a red light and failed to yield to V2, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
