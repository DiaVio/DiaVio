The driver of V1 misjudged the gap in traffic and made the decision to proceed with the left turn without sufficient clearance. This resulted in V1 stopping suddenly and straddling the center left turn lane, obstructing the path of V2. Although the driver of V2 assumed that V1 would complete the turn, it was ultimately V1's actions that led to the collision. V2 attempted to brake but was unable to avoid the crash due to the sudden stop by V1. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and decision to proceed without sufficient clearance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
