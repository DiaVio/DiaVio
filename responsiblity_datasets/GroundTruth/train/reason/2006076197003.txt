The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit and advisory speed for the curve. Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, which impaired their judgment and ability to safely navigate the curve. The police report also mentions that the driver was sleepy and fatigued, further contributing to their inability to control the vehicle. These factors indicate that V1's driver was negligent and failed to exercise reasonable care, making them primarily responsible for the crash.
