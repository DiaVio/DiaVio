The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway onto the soft gravel shoulder, then attempted to steer back onto the roadway but rotated slightly clockwise. V1 then straightened out briefly across both lanes at a northwest angle before rotating counterclockwise and going off the north edge of the roadway on the soft gravel shoulder. This series of actions ultimately led to V1 tripping and rolling over to the right, resulting in the accident.
