The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that he did not see V1 prior to the impact, indicating a failure to look to his left before entering the intersection. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance is the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2.
