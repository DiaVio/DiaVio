The driver of V1 admitted that he lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve on a wet road surface with standing water. He mentioned encountering a puddle and a drainage grate at the curve, which likely contributed to the loss of traction. The driver also stated that he was not familiar with the roadway and may not have been aware of the potential hazards. The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was the vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions caused by the recent heavy downpour. The Critical Reason was traveling too fast for conditions, specifically the wet road surface with standing water. The associated factors coded to V1 were a slick road surface and overcompensation.
