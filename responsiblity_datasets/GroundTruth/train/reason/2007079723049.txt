The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, and V1 had the right of way as it was traveling straight in its lane. V1 stated that they saw V2 in the turn lane but assumed that V2 would wait until they had passed through the intersection. However, V2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and turned left, resulting in the collision with the front of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
