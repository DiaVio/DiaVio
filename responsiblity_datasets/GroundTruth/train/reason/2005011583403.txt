The reason for this is that V1's critical reason for the pre-crash event was inadequate surveillance. V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection without adequately seeing the presence of oncoming traffic in lane 2. This lack of proper surveillance led to V1 pulling across the path of V2, resulting in the collision.
