The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the roadway, specifically failing to notice the elk in the roadway. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical event being coded as a driver-related factor: inadequate surveillance. Despite the driver's claim of applying the brakes, the inability to avoid the crash suggests a lack of proper attention and reaction to the presence of the elk.
