The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver took incorrect evasive action when faced with the merging of the unknown white, non-contact vehicle. Instead of safely maneuvering to avoid a collision, V1 turned right and applied the brakes, causing the vehicle to depart the right side of the road and collide with a non-breakaway light pole. V1's incorrect evasive action ultimately led to the crash, indicating that the driver failed to respond appropriately to the merging vehicle, resulting in the loss of control and subsequent collision.
