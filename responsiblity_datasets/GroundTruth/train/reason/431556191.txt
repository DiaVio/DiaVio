The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the left side of Vehicle 1 (the 2004 Honda CR-V) as both vehicles entered the intersection. This impact resulted in severe damage to Vehicle 1 and caused it to rotate counterclockwise to its final rest position. Additionally, Vehicle 2 sustained only minor damage. Therefore, it can be inferred that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way or violated traffic laws, leading to the collision with Vehicle 1.
