The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had a seizure, which caused the loss of control and resulted in the vehicle departing the left roadside and striking V2. The driver's decision to drive despite knowing about his regular seizures also contributes to his responsibility for the accident. Additionally, the internal distraction of smoking a cigarette may have further impaired the driver's ability to react and avoid the collision.
