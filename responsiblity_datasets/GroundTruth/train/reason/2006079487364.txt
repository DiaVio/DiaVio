The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one admitted to falling asleep and waking up just before the impact. This indicates that the driver was not alert and failed to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with the rear of Vehicle two (1997 Toyota Camry). The driver of Vehicle one's actions of hitting the brakes and swerving left at the last moment also suggest a lack of proper control and awareness. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver-related factor of falling asleep while driving.
