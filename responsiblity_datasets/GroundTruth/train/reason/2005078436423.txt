The driver of V1 was preoccupied and inattentive to the driving task due to thoughts about the death of her friend and making funeral arrangements. This inattention caused her to fail to notice the stopped vehicles ahead and ultimately resulted in her rear-ending V2 (the 2004 Jeep Cherokee), which then caused V2 to collide with V3 (the 1993 Isuzu Amigo pickup).
