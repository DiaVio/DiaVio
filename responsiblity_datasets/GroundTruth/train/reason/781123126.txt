The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 initiated a U-turn maneuver without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. The driver failed to see V2, the 2004 Volvo XC90, approaching in the number-two lane, resulting in a near side impact between the two vehicles. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver of V1 to yield the right of way and exercise caution while making the U-turn.
