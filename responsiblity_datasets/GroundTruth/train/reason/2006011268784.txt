The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before pulling out of the bank driveway. Despite being waved on by non-contact vehicles in lane one, V1 did not have a clear view of the traffic in lane two due to the congestion. This lack of proper surveillance and failure to look to the side contributed to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, having only been driving for 2 years, and was also late for work, which may have contributed to her impatience and decision to pull out without a clear view of the oncoming traffic.
