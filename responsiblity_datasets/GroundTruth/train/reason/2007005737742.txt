The reason for this is that V2 was traveling on the east/west roadway and had a stop sign at the intersection. V2 attempted to make a right turn at the intersection, but failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling straight on the northbound roadway. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the witness interview supports this conclusion, as the witness stated that V2 was stopped at the stop sign and attempted to make a right turn. The witness also mentioned that V1 was traveling at the appropriate speed limit and did not observe any negligent behavior from V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way.
