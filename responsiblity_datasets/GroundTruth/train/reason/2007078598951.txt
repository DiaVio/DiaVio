The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she overcompensated after being cut off by the non-contact vehicle. Instead of maintaining control of her vehicle, she rapidly steered to the right to avoid contact, then quickly steered left and applied the brakes, causing a loss of control and resulting in the counterclockwise yaw and subsequent rollover. V1's overcompensation and failure to maintain control of her vehicle ultimately led to the crash.
