The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a left turn in front of V1 (the Nissan Sentra) while traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. This is considered an illegal maneuver and a driver error. V1, on the other hand, was making a left turn from the correct lane and was not at fault for the collision.
