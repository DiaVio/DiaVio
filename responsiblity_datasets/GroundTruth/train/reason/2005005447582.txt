The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a seizure while driving, which is considered a critical non-performance error. This physical impairment of the ability to act led to V1 traveling off the roadway and ultimately colliding with a utility pole. The fact that the driver had a history of alcohol abuse, although not a contributing factor in this specific incident, may also be considered as a potential risk factor.
