The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the railroad crossing. She stated that she did not notice the signal lights flashing or the bells ringing, indicating that she did not pay attention to the warning signs. This lack of surveillance led to her being unable to back off the tracks in time, resulting in the collision with the train. Additionally, the driver's use of medication to help her fall asleep may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance. The possible side effects of drowsiness, dizziness, and daytime tiredness could have impaired her ability to fully focus on the road and notice the warning signals. Overall, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the railroad crossing and the potential impairment caused by medication use.
