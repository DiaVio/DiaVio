The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the right rear plane of Vehicle 1 (the 2012 Ford Edge) in a right-angle configuration, causing Vehicle 1 to rapidly rotate clockwise and subsequently collide with a metal utility pole. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way or violated the traffic signal at the intersection, resulting in the collision and subsequent injuries to the driver of Vehicle 1.
