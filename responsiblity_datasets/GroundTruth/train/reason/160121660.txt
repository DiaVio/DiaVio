The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the case occupant's injuries, such as rib fractures, pneumothoraces, pulmonary contusion, spinal cord contusion, forearm contusion, patella fractures, knee laceration, and hip contusion, were primarily caused by the forces exerted within her own vehicle during the collision. The deployment of the driver front airbag and the positioning of the seatbelt played a significant role in causing these injuries.
