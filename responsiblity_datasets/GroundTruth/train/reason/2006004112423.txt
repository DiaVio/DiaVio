The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making a left turn out of the private driveway. Despite looking three times in each direction, the driver did not see V2 approaching and incorrectly believed the roadway was clear. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was in a hurry and distracted by thoughts of the upcoming trip, which likely contributed to the failure to properly observe the oncoming vehicle. The driver's physical conditions and use of prescription medications may have also affected her ability to perceive the approaching vehicle. On the other hand, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking when she saw V1 pulling out of the driveway. However, when V1 stopped instead of turning, the driver of V2 assumed that V1 saw her and would wait for her to pass. This false assumption of V1's actions led to the driver of V2 speeding up, resulting in the collision. While the driver of V2 may have made an incorrect assumption, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for failing to properly surveil the roadway before making the left turn.
