The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, intending to go across the path of V1. V2 stated that she had the green arrow, indicating that she had the right of way to make the turn. However, V1 was traveling straight through the intersection in the eastbound lane, and V2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic. As a result, V2's false assumption that she had the right of way led to the collision with V1. V2's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic caused the accident.
