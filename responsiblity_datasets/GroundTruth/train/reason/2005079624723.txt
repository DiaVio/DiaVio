The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before executing the left turn. This is evident from the statement given to the police by the unlicensed driver of V1, who admitted to not seeing V2's approach prior to making the turn. The critical reason for the event, as coded by the police, is inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the sideswipe collision between V1 and V2, which subsequently led to the collision between V2 and V3.
