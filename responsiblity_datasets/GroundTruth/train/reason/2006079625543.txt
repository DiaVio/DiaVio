The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while changing lanes in a wet and curved section of the road. The driver's decision to change lanes in such conditions, combined with the slick road surface, led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the concrete divider. Additionally, the driver's speed of 56 kmph, which exceeded the advisory speed of 40 kmph, may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's actions and the environmental factor of slick roads.
