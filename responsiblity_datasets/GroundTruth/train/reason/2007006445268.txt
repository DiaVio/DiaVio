The driver of V1 failed to stop for a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. This indicates that V1 did not have the right of way and should have yielded to the traffic signal. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 at all, suggesting inadequate surveillance. These factors contribute to V1's responsibility for the collision.
