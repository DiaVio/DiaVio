The driver of V1 was distracted by looking left at approaching traffic, which was an external factor. Additionally, inadequate surveillance was coded as an associated factor. The driver's fatigue, due to lack of sleep as a full-time college student, may have also contributed to the accident. V2 (the 1995 Toyota 4-Runner) was stopped on the ramp due to a non-contact vehicle in front of it stopping to merge. While V2 was involved in the accident, the critical reason for the crash was not coded to this vehicle. The driver of V2 was taking a potent painkiller for pain relief from a recent neck/back surgery, which may have affected their ability to react to the situation. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's distraction and inadequate surveillance.
