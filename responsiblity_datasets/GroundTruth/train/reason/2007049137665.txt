The reason for this is that V1 drifted over the centerline and struck the left side of V2 (the 2006 Nissan Frontier) and V3 (the 1995 Ford Escort). V2 was stopped in the northbound lane, waiting to make a left turn at the intersection, and V3 was stopped behind V2. V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the left side of travel lane," indicating that V1 crossed over into the opposite lane. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." Therefore, V1's failure to maintain their lane and drifting into oncoming traffic resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
