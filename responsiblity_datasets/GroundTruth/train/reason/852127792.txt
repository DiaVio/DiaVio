The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the injuries sustained by the driver, including traumatic brain injury, chest and abdominal injuries, and multiple fractures, were all a result of the impact of V1 with the steering wheel and steering column. The injuries to the head, chest, and abdomen were directly caused by the driver's contact with the windshield, steering wheel, and steering column. Additionally, the fractures in the pelvic, femur, tibial, radial, and metacarpal bones were all a result of the driver's impact with the knee bolster, steering wheel, and windshield. Therefore, based on the injuries sustained by the driver and the corresponding impact points, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
