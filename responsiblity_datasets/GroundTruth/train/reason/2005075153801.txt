The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at storm clouds to the left, which was coded as an external distraction. This distraction caused V1 to be unable to stop in time and resulted in its front contacting the rear of V2 (1998 Chrysler Cirrus sedan), initiating the chain reaction of the collision.
