The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection against the red light, indicating a failure to obey traffic signals. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported that he did not see the red light until he was nearly in the intersection, suggesting inadequate surveillance and a lack of attention to the road. The driver's inexperience, having just obtained his license a week prior to the crash, further contributes to his responsibility for the accident.
