The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was reported to be decelerating and had an occupant distraction within the vehicle, which likely contributed to the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 1 (2005 Ford Taurus SE 4-door sedan) remained within its initial travel lane and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2, including decelerating and being distracted, were the primary factors that led to the accident.
