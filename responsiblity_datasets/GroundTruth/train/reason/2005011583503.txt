The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver reported that the vehicle began to hydroplane while trying to merge from the entrance ramp. The driver mentioned that braking lightly made the situation worse, and the vehicle started spinning counterclockwise until it crossed all three travel lanes and eventually rolled over. The contributing factor of the low tread on the left tires of the Jeep may have played a role in the hydroplaning. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was coded as V1 losing control due to poor road conditions, specifically puddling caused by heavy rain.
