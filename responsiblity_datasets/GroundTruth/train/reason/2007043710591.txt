The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to look far enough ahead due to being distracted by removing her sunglasses. This distraction caused her to not notice V2 (the 2000 Nissan Frontier) stopped in her lane. Additionally, V1 was driving too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the lack of visible skid marks prior to impact. V1's inexperience as a driver, with only 9 months of driving experience, may have also contributed to her inability to react in time to avoid the collision. While V2 was stopped in the lane, it is important to note that V1 is responsible for maintaining a safe following distance and being attentive to the road ahead. V2's actions, such as not having his brakes applied while waiting for a break in traffic, do not absolve V1 of her responsibility to avoid a collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to her distraction, failure to look ahead, and driving too fast for the conditions.
