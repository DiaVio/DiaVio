The driver of V1 suffered a seizure, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. This physical impairment of the ability to act caused V1 to continue eastbound and collide with the rear of V2 (the 2006 Dodge Charger), initiating the chain reaction. V2, on the other hand, was behind two other vehicles that were stopped at a stop sign. It is unclear whether all the vehicles were at a complete stop or still in motion. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was identified as "Other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed," but no critical reason was coded to V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's seizure, which impaired their ability to act and resulted in the collision with V2.
