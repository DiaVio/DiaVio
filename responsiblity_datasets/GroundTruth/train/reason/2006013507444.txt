The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver proceeded to turn left at the intersection without waiting for eastbound traffic to clear. This indicates a failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver admitted to being distracted and not knowing why she proceeded to turn left when the light turned green. These factors suggest a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver, contributing to the crash.
