The reason for V2's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the green light. She mentioned that the traffic in southbound lane two was backed up, obstructing her view of oncoming traffic in lane one. This decision error, combined with the recognition error of being distracted by talking to her daughter, led to her striking the left side of V1 in the intersection.
