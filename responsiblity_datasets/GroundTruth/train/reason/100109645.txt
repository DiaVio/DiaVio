The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to travel off the roadway onto the left shoulder and median, ultimately resulting in the vehicle going over the embankment and colliding with an upward embankment. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lanes.
