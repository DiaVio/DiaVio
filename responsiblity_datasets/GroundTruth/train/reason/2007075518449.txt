The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a fifteen-year-old female, was traveling too fast for the conditions. She was unfamiliar with the vehicle and the roadway, having only driven the vehicle a few times before and being on the roadway for the first time. Additionally, she was conversing with her passengers about directions to the school, indicating a potential distraction. The driver's poor directional control, overcompensation, and inexperience further contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Finally, it is worth noting that the driver did not have a license or permit to drive and did not have permission to take the truck to the school, suggesting a potential rush to return the vehicle before being discovered. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's excessive speed, poor directional control, inexperience, and potential distractions.
