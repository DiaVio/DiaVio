The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while trying to negotiate the left curve. The driver admitted that he was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which were compounded by the presence of slushy spots mixing with falling snow. Additionally, the curve itself had a roadway deficiency, as the measured radius of curvature was smaller than what is recommended for a curve with a superelevation of 10 percent and a posted speed limit of 35 mph. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the road conditions and the roadway deficiency of the curve.
