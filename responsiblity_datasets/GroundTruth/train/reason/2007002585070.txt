The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by talking on his cell phone and arguing with his ex-wife at the time of the crash. This distraction caused a driver recognition error, leading to V1 misjudging the turn and driving off the right side of the roadway, ultimately resulting in the collision with the tree. Additionally, the driver was also cited for speeding, indicating that he was traveling too fast for the curve. The combination of distraction, speeding, and possible aggressive driving due to the ongoing argument all contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
