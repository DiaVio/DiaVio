The driver of V1 failed to take adequate evasive action to prevent the crash or lessen the severity of the impact. Despite anticipating a lane change and checking his mirrors, he did not react in time when he looked back to the front and saw that V2 had stopped to make a left turn. This lack of evasive action contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions, as he admitted to traveling between 51-60 mph in a 45 mph zone. This excessive speed further compromised his ability to react in a timely manner. While V2 (the driver of the 2000 Chevrolet Silverado pickup) was involved in the critical pre-crash event by changing lanes in front of V1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to take evasive action and their excessive speed for the conditions.
