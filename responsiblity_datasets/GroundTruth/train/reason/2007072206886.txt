The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that a non-contact vehicle stopped in lane one to allow him to enter the roadway, so he assumed that V2 would also stop. However, V2 did not stop and collided with the left side of V1 as it entered the turn lane. While V2's failure to look to the side ahead was an associated factor in the crash, V1's false assumption and failure to properly assess the situation before entering the roadway were the critical factors that led to the collision.
