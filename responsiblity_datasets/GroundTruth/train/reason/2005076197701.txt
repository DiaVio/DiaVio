The reason for this is that V1 failed to take the correct evasive action to avoid the collision. The driver of V1 stated that he saw the crash unfolding but did not think there was any way to avoid it. However, he also mentioned that if he had steered left into the second lane, the crash could have been avoided. This indicates that there was a possible alternative course of action that V1 could have taken to prevent the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating," suggesting that V2 was slowing down to turn right into a driveway. V1 should have been aware of this and adjusted their driving accordingly to avoid a rear-end collision. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to take appropriate evasive action and the fact that there was a possible alternative course of action available, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
