The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by reaching for his dropped cell phone, which was an internal distraction. This distraction caused him to veer off the road and ultimately collide with a light post. Additionally, an incorrect avoidance maneuver was performed by swerving to the left, which further contributed to the crash.
