The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the crash occurred when V1 drove off the roadway to the right, possibly due to a syncope episode experienced by the driver. This action led to V1 striking a large pole anchored by a concrete slab. The subsequent rotation and rolling of V1 resulted in it coming to a final rest on its driver side, partially on the right shoulder of the roadway and partially in the unpaved area adjacent to the roadway. Therefore, V1's departure from the roadway and subsequent collision with the pole indicate that it was the primarily responsible vehicle in this frontal crash.
