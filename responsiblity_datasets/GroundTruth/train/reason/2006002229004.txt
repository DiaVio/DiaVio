The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass the tractor-trailer while negotiating a curve, entering V2's lane of travel. This is an illegal maneuver as V1 passed against a double yellow line in an unsafe location. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he had fallen asleep, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving.
