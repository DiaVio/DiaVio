The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection without stopping or slowing down prior to entering the intersection. This is considered an illegal maneuver, as the driver should have yielded to oncoming traffic before making the turn. Additionally, V1 did not attempt any evasive maneuvers to avoid the collision. While V2 (the driver of the 1988 Oldsmobile Delta 88) also had obstructed sightlines and was feeling tired and hungry, V1's failure to yield and make a safe left turn is the main contributing factor to the accident.
