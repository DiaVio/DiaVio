The reason for this is that V1 pulled out to cross the southbound lanes of the divided highway after stopping at the stop sign. V2 (the 2004 Lincoln Aviator) was traveling on the uncontrolled highway and struck V1 in the left rear door and rear quarter panel. V1's action of pulling out into the path of oncoming traffic without yielding or ensuring it was safe to do so is a violation of traffic rules and is considered the primary cause of the accident.
