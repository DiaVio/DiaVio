The reason for this is that V1 proceeded into the intersection with insufficient clearance and failed to yield the right-of-way to V2 (the brown 2000 Volvo tractor pulling a flatbed semi-trailer). V1 also attempted to pass V2 to the right within the same travel lane, which was a false assumption of V2's actions. V1's driver made a decision error by falsely assuming the actions of V2, leading to the collision.
