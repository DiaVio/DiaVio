The driver of V1 was distracted by external factors, which led to inadequate surveillance. This means that she failed to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming traffic before proceeding. Additionally, she admitted to accelerating to clear the intersection before the light turned red, indicating a lack of caution and disregard for traffic rules. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2001 Chevrolet Express) was not at fault for the accident. Although he was driving between work locations and felt drowsy, it was stated that this was not a factor in the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment," indicating that V1 crossed into V2's path. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving and inadequate surveillance, while V2 was not at fault.
