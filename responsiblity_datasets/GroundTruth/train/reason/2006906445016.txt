The driver of V1 became distracted by pedestrians on the sidewalk and when he returned his attention to the roadway, he saw that traffic was slowing down. In an attempt to avoid striking the vehicle in front of him, he braked hard and steered left into the center turn lane, but lost control of his vehicle. This action caused V1 to partially enter the westbound side of the roadway and sideswipe V2, initiating the chain of events that led to the subsequent collisions. The driver of V1 admitted to being fatigued and having consumed alcohol the previous night, which may have impaired his judgment and reaction time.
