The driver of V2 was traveling over the speed limit and admitted to being distracted by looking for a CD on the floorboard. This distraction caused the driver to not realize that V1 was decelerating in the traffic lane, leading to the collision. Additionally, V2 under rode V1, indicating that V2 was following too closely and did not maintain a safe distance. Therefore, V2's speeding, distraction, and failure to maintain a safe distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
