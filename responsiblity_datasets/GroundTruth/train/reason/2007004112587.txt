The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left turn in front of oncoming traffic without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This is evident from the statement of V2's driver, who mentioned that V1 made a quick left in front of him and then stopped. Additionally, the police report stated that V1 stopped in the direct path of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Furthermore, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was identified as "This vehicle traveling - turning left at intersection," and the Critical Reason for this event was coded as "Panic/Freezing." This suggests that the driver of V1 panicked and froze up, which prevented them from taking appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and their panic/freezing response, which led to the collision with V2.
