The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 veered to the right side of the roadway, ultimately impacting a wooden utility pole. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 removed their license plates and left the scene on foot, indicating a potential attempt to evade responsibility. Without any skid marks on the roadway, it is unclear what caused Vehicle #1 to veer off the road. However, the fact that the driver fled the scene suggests a possible violation of traffic laws or negligence on their part.
