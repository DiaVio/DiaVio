The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the vehicles ahead or realizing that the vehicle in front of him was slowing down until it was too late to avoid the collision. The driver was distracted by a conversation with his passenger, which led to a recognition error. Additionally, the driver of V1 was also using prescription medication and had an unspecified heart condition, which may have contributed to his failure to react in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, failure to recognize the slowing traffic, and inability to avoid the collision.
