The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. The driver of V2 stated that he was looking straight ahead and assumed the intersection was clear after a vehicle in the westbound direction turned left. However, he failed to notice V1 approaching from the northbound direction, resulting in the collision. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance led to the critical pre-crash event of V2 crossing over the intersection and ultimately causing the accident.
