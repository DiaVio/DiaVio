The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of his vehicle, crossed over the center line, and entered into the eastbound travel lane, ultimately striking the front end of Vehicle 2 (the 1998 Toyota 4-Runner) in a head-on configuration. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was at fault for causing the collision.
