The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by something to her right as she rounded the curve. This distraction caused her to drift into the oncoming lane and make contact with V2 (the 2005 Chevrolet Silverado) before colliding head-on with V3 (the 2005 Toyota Camry). Additionally, the driver of V1 tested positive for cocaine and marijuana, which can impair driving abilities. The combination of external distraction, drug use, fatigue, and heavy congestion contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of her vehicle and avoid the crash.
