The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the left side of the roadway, struck a guardrail, and then crossed all four southbound lanes before colliding with a bridge wall. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the collision.
