The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. The physical evidence also suggests that V1 steered to the right prior to the impact, indicating a lack of attention or control on the part of the driver. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others - vehicles stopping in front." This further supports the conclusion that V1 was traveling at an unsafe speed for the conditions and was unable to react appropriately to the vehicles ahead. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and their inability to respond to the stopped vehicles in front of them.
