The driver of V1 drifted over the left lane line, causing the vehicle to head straight into the path of V2 (the Peterbilt tractor-trailer). Despite attempts by V2 to avoid the collision by honking the horn, steering left, and braking, V1 was unsuccessful in avoiding the crash and struck the front of V2. The driver of V1 was reportedly distracted by adjusting the climate controls, which likely contributed to the driver drifting out of their lane. Additionally, the presence of drug paraphernalia in the driver's purse raises concerns about potential impairment. However, without the results of the driver's blood test, it cannot be definitively determined if the driver was under the influence of drugs at the time of the crash. Nonetheless, the driver's inexperience, having been licensed for only a month, is also a contributing factor to the crash.
