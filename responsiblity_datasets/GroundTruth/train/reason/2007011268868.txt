The driver of V1 stated that he saw the red traffic signal and applied the brakes to try to stop in time. However, he was unable to stop in time due to the full load he was carrying, which included a trailer loaded with lawn mowers. The driver also mentioned that he had only started driving the truck and pulling the trailer a few months ago, indicating a lack of experience and comfort with the trailer. Additionally, the witness stated that she observed V1's trailer swinging to the left and then out to the right before striking V2, who was stopped at the red signal. This suggests that V1's loss of control and jackknifing of the trailer contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inability to stop in time and the control loss of the trailer.
