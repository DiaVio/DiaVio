The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being "driver related factor; poor directional control." The driver stated that her foot slipped off the brake as she was approaching V2, which suggests a lack of proper control over the vehicle. Additionally, V2 (the driver of the 1990 Lincoln Town Car) was stopped and had seen V1 when looking in her rearview mirror. She attempted to avoid the collision by turning the wheels to the right, but was unable to do so. This indicates that V2 took appropriate measures to prevent the accident, but V1's lack of control over their vehicle resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to control the vehicle properly.
