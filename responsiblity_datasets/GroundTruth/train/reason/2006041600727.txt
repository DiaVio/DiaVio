The reason for this is that V1 was driving in lane one while distracted by his cell phone. When the traffic in front of him slowed down, he was unable to stop in time due to his distraction and the cargo trailer he was pulling. As a result, he collided with the back of V2, which then caused a chain reaction and pushed V2 into the back of V3. V1's distracted driving and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him led to the collision.
