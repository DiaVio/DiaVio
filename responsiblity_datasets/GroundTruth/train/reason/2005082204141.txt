The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the red light and collided with the rear of V2 (the black Nissan Sentra), causing a chain reaction that involved V3, V4, and V5. V1's failure to stop indicates a clear violation of traffic laws and a disregard for the safety of other vehicles on the road. Additionally, the fact that V1 did not recall being in the crash and was later found to have a medical condition (seizure) that could impair their ability to act further supports their responsibility for the accident.
