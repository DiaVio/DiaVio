The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver took the turn too wide, resulting in the vehicle striking the curb multiple times and ultimately losing control. The passenger's claim of steering failure was found to be incorrect after inspecting the vehicle for mechanical failures. Additionally, no other factors such as fatigue or health issues were identified as contributing to the crash. Therefore, the driver's error in judgment and failure to properly navigate the turn led to the accident.
