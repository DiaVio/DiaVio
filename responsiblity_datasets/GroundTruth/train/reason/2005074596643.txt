The reason for this is that V1 admitted to rolling through the stop sign without properly checking for oncoming traffic. This indicates a clear violation of traffic rules and a failure to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1995 Nissan Altima) who was already in the intersection. Additionally, V1 stated that he misjudged the speed of V2, further indicating a lack of attention and awareness while making the left turn. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the gap and failure to yield to oncoming traffic are the primary factors that led to the collision.
