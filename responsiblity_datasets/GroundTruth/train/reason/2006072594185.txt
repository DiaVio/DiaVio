The reason for this is that V1 failed to detect the traffic control signal, entered the intersection without stopping, and struck V2 (the Jeep Grand Cherokee). V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment-from opposite direction-over left lane line" and the critical reason was inadequate surveillance. V1 claimed to have a green light, but in fact, the signal was red. Additionally, V1 attempted evasive maneuvers but not in time to avoid the crash. On the other hand, V2 was driving on a protective green arrow and did not stop prior to initiating a left turn at the intersection. However, V2's critical pre-crash event was simply coded as "this vehicle traveling-turning left at intersection" and no critical reason was coded for V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to obey the traffic control signal and inadequate surveillance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
