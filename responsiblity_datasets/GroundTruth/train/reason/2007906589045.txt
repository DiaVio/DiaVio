The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and recognize the presence of V2 (the 2006 Chevrolet Impala) approaching with lights and siren on. This recognition error, combined with possible inattention/distraction and an illegal maneuver of failing to stop at a traffic control device, led to V1 speeding through the intersection on a red light and colliding with V2. Although V2 was traveling with lights and siren on, indicating an emergency response, the witness account confirms that V2 entered the intersection on a full green traffic light. Therefore, V2 was not at fault for the accident.
