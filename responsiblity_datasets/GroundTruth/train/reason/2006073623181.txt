The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 struck the rear of V2 (the Ford F-250 truck) while V2 was slowing down to make a turn into the crossover. V1 failed to recognize V2's intentions and was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there were no skid marks from V1 to indicate any attempt to brake prior to the crash, suggesting a recognition error on the part of V1's driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to recognize and react to the slowing of V2.
