The critical pre-crash event for V1 was that it was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that it was cutting the corner while traveling around the curve. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as the driver-related factor of being too fast for the curve/turn. This suggests that V1 was not able to maintain control while navigating the curve at the appropriate speed, resulting in it encroaching into the opposite lane and colliding with V2 (the 1994 Ford Explorer SUV). V2, on the other hand, was simply traveling on the right side of the road and entering a straight part of the road, indicating that it was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control and drive at a safe speed for the curve.
