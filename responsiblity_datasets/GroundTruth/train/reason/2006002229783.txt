The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 113kmph (70mph), which is significantly above the posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph). Additionally, the driver of V1 was addicted to prescription pain medication and alcohol, which could have impaired her ability to drive safely. The witness also stated that there were no signs of braking or vehicle correction during the crash, indicating a lack of driver response to the situation. Finally, V1 went off the roadway to the right and sideswiped a guardrail, indicating poor directional control. Overall, the combination of excessive speed, impaired driving, and poor vehicle control make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
