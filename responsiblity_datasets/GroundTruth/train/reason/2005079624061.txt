The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn. The driver of V1 stated that they did not see V2 approaching the intersection, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness of other vehicles on the road. This failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2.
