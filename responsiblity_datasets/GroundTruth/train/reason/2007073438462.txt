The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when a dog entered the roadway. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle, the driver steered left and applied the brakes, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise and ultimately collide with a tree. This overcompensation was a driver-related factor that led to the crash. Additionally, the snow-covered roadway and the vehicle's speed were associated factors in this accident. The driver's speed of 48-64 kmph (30-40 mph) may have been too fast for the snowy conditions, making it more difficult to maintain control of the vehicle when encountering an obstacle. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's overcompensation and potentially excessive speed given the weather conditions.
