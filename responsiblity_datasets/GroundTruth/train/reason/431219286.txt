The reason for this is that V2 entered the northbound travel lanes from an exit ramp, traveling in the wrong direction. This action resulted in an offset frontal crash configuration with Vehicle one (V1), the 2004 four-door Volvo S60, which was properly traveling in the northbound left lane. V2's incorrect entry onto the roadway caused the collision.
