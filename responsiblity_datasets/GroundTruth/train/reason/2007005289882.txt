The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as an illegal maneuver (failing to stop for a traffic control device), indicating that V1 did not stop at the red light before entering the intersection. Additionally, associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include the use of prescription medications and inadequate surveillance. V2 (the driver of the 2007 Lincoln MKZ) had the right of way as the light had turned green for her. She claimed that she did not see the other vehicle approaching, indicating that V1 failed to yield to the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stop at the red light and yield to the right of way of V2.
