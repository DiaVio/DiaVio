The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 made an overcompensation error while trying to avoid the second non-contact vehicle. This error led to the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as she had only been licensed for 6 months, may have contributed to the overcompensation error.
