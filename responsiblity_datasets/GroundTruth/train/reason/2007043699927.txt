The driver of V1 made a left turn without being able to see out of the windshield due to smudges caused by pine tar and the glare from the rising sun. This decision error led to the collision with V2 (the Jeep Wrangler) that was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's estimated travel and impact speeds were significantly lower than V2's, indicating that V1 was likely at fault for not yielding the right of way.
