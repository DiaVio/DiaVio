The driver of V1 admitted to attempting to change lanes to avoid V2 (the Toyota Corolla) when V2 slowed down for traffic ahead. However, V1's attempt to change lanes resulted in a collision with V2. This indicates that V1 made a driver-related decision error by traveling too close to respond to the unexpected actions of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by a phone conversation with her husband, which could have contributed to her failure to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error and distraction.
