The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes without properly checking for other vehicles, specifically the witness who was behind her in lane one. This action resulted in V1 veering back to the left and colliding with V2 in V2's lane of travel. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reportedly talking on a cell phone while driving, which indicates driver inattention and distraction. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the crash. It is important to note that V2 (the Kenworth T300) did not have any critical reason or associated factors that contributed to the crash, indicating that V2 was not at fault.
