The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the school bus's actions. The driver of V1 stated that he noticed the school bus with its right turn signal on and observed it slowing down. Based on these observations, the driver assumed that the school bus was going to make a right turn at the intersection where V1 was exiting. However, the school bus was actually intending to continue straight through the intersection and make a right turn further north. V1's false assumption of the school bus's actions led to the driver attempting to make a left turn in front of the school bus, resulting in the collision. V1 had a stop sign and should have yielded the right of way to the school bus, which was traveling on the main road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption of the school bus's intended actions and failure to yield the right of way.
