The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was cited for following too closely. This indicates that Vehicle #1 was not maintaining a safe distance from Vehicle #2 (1996 Nissan Sentra) and failed to stop in time, resulting in a rear-end collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by an argument with her passenger, which is considered a recognition error and an internal distraction. These factors contribute to the driver's failure to recognize that Vehicle #2 had stopped at the red light, leading to the collision.
