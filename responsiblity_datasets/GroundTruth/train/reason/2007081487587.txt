The driver of V1 admitted to being extremely fatigued, unfocused, and out of it at the time of the collision. She reported not being able to eat or sleep much for 11 days due to personal issues, including her husband's affair and request for a divorce. She also mentioned having an argument with her husband shortly before the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inattention (daydreaming), indicating that the driver was not paying proper attention to the road and her surroundings. Therefore, V1's lack of sleep, emotional distress, and inattention are the main contributing factors to this collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
