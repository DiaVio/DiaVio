The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle drifting off the roadway and ultimately colliding with multiple trees. The driver's drowsiness/fatigue, possibly due to attending a party the night before and consuming alcohol, contributed to the driver falling asleep. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway may have played a role in the accident. While speed is not believed to be a factor, the driver's decision to operate the vehicle while fatigued and drowsy ultimately led to the crash.
