The driver of V1, an 18-year old male, made a right turn into lane one without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This was a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, having only been driving for one year, and was driving on a learner's permit. The tires of V1 also had deficiencies, with the left rear and right rear tires having low tread depths and the right rear tire having low air pressure. On the other hand, V2 (the 2001 Nissan Altima) was traveling at or just under the speed limit in the right curb lane. The driver of V2 did not take notice of V1 until it pulled out in front of him, at which point he attempted to avoid V1 by steering to the left and locking his brakes. However, V2's critical event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment, from driveway, turning into same direction," indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the given information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error, inadequate surveillance, inexperience, and tire deficiencies.
