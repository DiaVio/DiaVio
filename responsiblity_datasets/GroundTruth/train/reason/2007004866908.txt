The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that she did not look to the left again after being waved on by a non-contact truck, which resulted in her not seeing V2 (the 2003 Dodge Ram) approaching from the east. This lack of surveillance and failure to look to the side led to V1 pulling into the intersection and colliding with the right rear side of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was also coded with factors such as being focused on an extraneous vehicle and having inexperience as a driver, which may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the situation before making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately survey the intersection and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
