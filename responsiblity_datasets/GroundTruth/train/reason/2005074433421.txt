The reason for this is that the driver of V2 misjudged the speed and gap of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 had visual impairments and a history of stroke, which may have affected their ability to accurately assess the situation. The driver of V2 also made a performance error by proceeding slowly across the southbound lanes instead of waiting for V1 to clear the intersection or entering the intersection at a higher speed to clear the lanes. These actions by the driver of V2 contributed to the collision.
