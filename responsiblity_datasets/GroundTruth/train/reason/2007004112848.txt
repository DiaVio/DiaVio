The driver of V1 stated that he was intending to make a left turn at the intersection and believed that the roadway coming from the opposite direction was clear. However, he failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 (the GMC 2500) approaching in lane one. Despite attempting to brake, V1 was unable to avoid the collision and struck the left front of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
