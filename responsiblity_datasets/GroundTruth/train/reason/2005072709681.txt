The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver exhibited poor directional control and failed to maintain her vehicle within her travel lane. She admitted to looking for the feeder area on the left side and not seeing the truck beside her. This resulted in V1 drifting across the right lane line and colliding with the external gas tank of V2's tractor. Additionally, V1's overcompensation while attempting to return to her original travel lane caused a second impact with the back left corner of V2's tractor cab. Therefore, V1's failure to control her vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected and her failure to maintain her lane are the primary reasons for the crash.
