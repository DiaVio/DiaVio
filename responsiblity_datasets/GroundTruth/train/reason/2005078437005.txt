The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the Nissan Altima) when attempting to change lanes. Despite looking in the rearview mirror and seeing V2 approaching, V1 still proceeded to enter the left turn lane, resulting in the collision with V2. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, leading to the accident.
