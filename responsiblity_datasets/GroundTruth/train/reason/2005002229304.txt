The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions, as indicated by the statement that she was going 45MPH (72KMPH) in a curve with a posted speed limit of 55MPH (89KMPH). Additionally, the driver mentioned that the vehicle started to skid and she tried braking and steering to the right, but it didn't help. This suggests a lack of control over the vehicle due to excessive speed. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the lead tire (Left Front tire) of Vehicle #1 had only 1mm of tread at the time of the crash, which could have contributed to the loss of control. The Critical Precrash Event coded for Vehicle #1 was "Vehicle Control Loss Due to Traveling too fast for conditions," and the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was "Driver Related Factor Decision Errors, Too fast for conditions." Therefore, based on the driver's excessive speed, lack of control, and the critical factors identified by the police, Vehicle #1 (the 1993 Mazda 626) is primarily responsible for the crash.
