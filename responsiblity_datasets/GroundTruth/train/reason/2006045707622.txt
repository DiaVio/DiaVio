The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated after the right front tire edged off the right side of the pavement. This overcompensation led to the vehicle swerving left, crossing the centerline, and ultimately departing the right side of the road, resulting in the collision with the utility pole. Factors such as the driver's fatigue due to recent flu symptoms, lessened sleep, and unfamiliarity with the roadway may have contributed to the poor directional control and overcompensation.
