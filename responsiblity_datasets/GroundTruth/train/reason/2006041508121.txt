The Critical Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from the adjacent lane - over the right lane line. This suggests that V2 crossed over the lane line and encroached into the lane of V1, the medium/heavy truck. As a result, the left side of V1 made contact with the right front quarter panel of V2, causing V1 to veer to the right and roll onto its left side. Since V2 encroached into the lane of V1, it can be inferred that V2 failed to maintain its lane and caused the collision. However, it is important to note that the Critical Reason for the Critical Event of V2 was not coded, and no associated factors could be determined due to lack of data.
