The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they engaged in an illegal maneuver by traveling into the opposing traffic lane to pass another vehicle. This action violated the no-passing zone indicated by the double yellow center lines. Additionally, V1 was reported to be traveling at a speed of 97 kmph, which is significantly higher than the speed limit of 56 kmph. V2 (the driver of the 1991 Honda Accord) was traveling within their own lane and took evasive action by applying the brakes and steering right upon noticing V1. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and excessive speed make them primarily responsible for the accident.
