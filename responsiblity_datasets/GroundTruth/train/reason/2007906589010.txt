The driver of Vehicle 1 may have had a seizure or experienced a medical condition that caused him to lose control of the vehicle and collide with the rear of Vehicle 2. This initial impact then caused Vehicle 2 to collide with the rear of Vehicle 3, resulting in a chain reaction. The driver of Vehicle 1's medical records indicate that he has diabetes and was treated for hypoglycemia, which may have caused him to black out. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle 1 is "other motor vehicle in lane, stopped," suggesting that the driver failed to notice the stopped vehicles ahead and was unable to stop in time. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's medical condition and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
