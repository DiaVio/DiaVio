The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling at a high speed of 75 MPH, which was above the speed limit of 55 MPH. Additionally, the driver failed to look far enough ahead and was unable to respond in time to the unexpected actions of Vehicle #2. The driver's decision error of being too fast to respond to the situation led to the collision with Vehicle #2. Rush hour congestion was also a contributing factor. Vehicle #2 (the 2003 Chevy Trailblazer) is not primarily responsible for the crash. The driver of Vehicle #2 was in the far left lane and had plenty of room to stop. The driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle. Vehicle #3 (the 1988 Chevy S10 pickup truck) is not primarily responsible for the crash. The driver of Vehicle #3 was in the far right lane and was slowing down along with the other vehicles due to traffic congestion. The driver stated that Vehicle #1 hit the brakes too late and hit Vehicle #2, causing it to go out of control. Vehicle #3 then collided with the back of Vehicle #1. This driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle.
