The reason for this is that V1 was accelerating in a low-speed turn on a road that was ice, slush, and snow-covered. This indicates that the driver was not exercising caution and adjusting their driving behavior to the road conditions. As a result, V1 lost control of the vehicle, leading to the counterclockwise and clockwise rotations, ultimately resulting in a collision with the concrete barrier wall. It is important for drivers to adapt their driving to the prevailing road conditions, especially when there is ice, slush, and snow present. In this case, V1 failed to do so, leading to the accident.
