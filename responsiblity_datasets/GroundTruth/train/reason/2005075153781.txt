The reason for this is that Vehicle one veered to the left, crossed the center two-way left turn lane and the westbound lane, and ultimately departed the roadway. It then collided with Vehicle two (the parked 1994 Ford Explorer) on its left side. Vehicle one's swerving and departure from the roadway indicate a lack of control and failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident was determined to be driver-related, specifically "other critical non-performance (alcohol impaired ability to drive)." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle one was impaired by alcohol, which likely contributed to their inability to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to their erratic driving behavior and impaired ability to operate the vehicle safely.
