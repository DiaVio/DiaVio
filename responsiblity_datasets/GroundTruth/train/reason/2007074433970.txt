The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the opposite lane, specifically the left lane, which resulted in the collision with V1. V2 assumed that V1 would yield the right-of-way, but this assumption was incorrect. Therefore, V2's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
