The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol level of .21, which is significantly above the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely and resulted in her veering out of the travel lane and colliding with the parked vehicle. Additionally, the driver admitted to being distracted by reaching for something that had fallen, further contributing to the crash.
