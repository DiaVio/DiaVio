The reason for assigning primary responsibility to Vehicle 1 is that the injuries suffered by the passenger, including severe chest injuries, rib fractures, diaphragmatic laceration, aortic injury, spine fractures, and ulna fracture, were all sourced to the impact and the restraint system of Vehicle 1. The seatbelt in Vehicle 1 restrained the passenger's body during the impact, causing injuries to various parts of her body, including the chest, abdomen, spine, and arm. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the injuries sustained by the passenger.
