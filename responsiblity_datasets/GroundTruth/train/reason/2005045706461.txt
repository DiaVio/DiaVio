The reason for Vehicle 1's responsibility is that the driver swerved right into the parking lanes and onto the sidewalk, causing multiple collisions with objects and ultimately coming to rest on the sidewalk. The driver admitted to being distracted by looking at store signs to her right, which led to inadequate and incorrect evasive action and poor directional control. Additionally, the EDR data showed that the throttle was at 100% instead of the brake being activated when avoidance actions became necessary.
