The driver of V1 admitted to making a rolling stop at the stop sign and then attempting to make a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. The witness also confirmed that V1 made a rolling stop while attempting to make the left turn. Additionally, there was a possible partial sight-line restriction for V1 due to a tree on the left corner. Therefore, V1's failure to properly stop at the stop sign, inadequate surveillance, and potential sight-line restriction contributed to the collision with V2.
