The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive speed, which prevented her from being able to respond to the unexpected actions of the phantom vehicle changing lanes into her path. Additionally, the driver admitted to changing lanes too quickly and jerking the wheel to the right in order to avoid the phantom vehicle, which ultimately led to her losing control of the vehicle and colliding with the concrete barrier. The driver's excessive speed, hurried driving pattern, and the presence of an argument within twelve hours preceding the crash all contributed to her inability to maintain control of her vehicle.
