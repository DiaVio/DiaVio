The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was leaving the side of the roadway (sidewalk) to re-enter the roadway, and the driver failed to adequately surveil the road before making the left turn. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver did not look or failed to see the approaching Vehicle 1. This lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with Vehicle 1.
