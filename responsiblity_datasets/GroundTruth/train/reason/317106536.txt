The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kph (60 mph), exceeding the posted speed limit of 80 kph (50 mph). Additionally, V1 collided with both Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado pickup, and Vehicle 3 (V3), a 2009 Ford F-350 pickup. V1 struck the rear left of V2 and then continued into the fourth lane, where it struck the rear of V3. The fact that V1 was unable to maintain control and collided with two other vehicles suggests that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belts, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained in the crash.
