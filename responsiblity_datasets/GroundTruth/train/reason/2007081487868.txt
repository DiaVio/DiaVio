The reason for this is that V1 attempted to turn left into a private driveway without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. Although a non-contact vehicle left a gap and waved V1 to cross, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to do so. V1 turned with an obstructed view, which indicates a failure to exercise proper caution and judgment while making the left turn.
