The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which indicates a lack of attention and control over the vehicle. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated the driver's travel speed to be 96 kmph (60 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The witness also reported that the driver was traveling at excessive speed and almost struck them prior to the crash. These factors suggest that V1 was being operated in a careless and reckless manner, contributing to the occurrence of the accident.
