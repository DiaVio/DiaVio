The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the roadway to the right, striking two posts with its left side, and then overturned with the left side leading. It then went airborne and struck a utility pole with its left side before overturning onto its right side. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle, potentially due to the icy road conditions and sleet at the time of the crash. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the roadway ultimately led to the collision.
