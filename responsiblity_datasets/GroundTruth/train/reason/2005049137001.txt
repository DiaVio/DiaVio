The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was using a cellular phone while driving, which is a form of driver distraction and inattention. This distraction caused the driver to be unaware that she did not have a protected left turn arrow at the intersection. Additionally, the driver failed to adequately surveil the traffic controls, further contributing to the accident. V2 (the driver of the 1997 Ford Mustang Coupe) is not primarily responsible as there is no information provided to suggest any fault on their part.
