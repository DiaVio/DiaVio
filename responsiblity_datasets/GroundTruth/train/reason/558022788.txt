The reason for this is that the case vehicle, a 2003 Buick LeSabre sedan, was traveling northbound on a six-lane divided roadway and had the right of way. V2, on the other hand, was eastbound on the intersecting five-lane divided roadway. The case vehicle crossed the path of V2, indicating that V2 failed to yield or stop at the intersection. This resulted in the left side impact between the two vehicles. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way at the controlled intersection.
