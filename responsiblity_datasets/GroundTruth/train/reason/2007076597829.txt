The reason for this is that V1 entered the primary roadway and crossed the eastbound lanes intending to turn left into the westbound lanes without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. V1 stated that she looked both ways while stopped at the stop sign, but did not see V2 until the impact occurred. This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the traffic situation before making the left turn. Additionally, the associative factors of having a conversation and driver inexperience contribute to V1's responsibility. Being engaged in a conversation and listening to an audio tape may have distracted V1 from fully focusing on the task of driving. Furthermore, being a 17-year-old driver suggests a lack of experience and potentially less developed driving skills. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance, distraction from conversation, and driver inexperience make her primarily responsible for the crash.
