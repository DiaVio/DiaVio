The reason for this is that V1 was changing lanes from lane three to lane two while passing a slow-moving truck, and in doing so, the front of V1 struck the rear of V2 (the 2001 Dodge Ram), causing V2's front to strike the rear of V3 (the 2003 Jeep Liberty). This indicates that V1 failed to properly control their vehicle and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the inexperience of the 16-year-old driver and their physical impairment (cerebral palsy) may have contributed to the driver's poor directional control and inability to properly handle the vehicle under the given conditions.
