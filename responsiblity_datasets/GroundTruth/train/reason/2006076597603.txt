The reason for this is that V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering to the right into the second lane to avoid the non-contact vehicle that entered the third lane. This action resulted in the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis). V1's decision to steer into the second lane instead of braking or taking other appropriate evasive actions contributed to the cause of the accident.
