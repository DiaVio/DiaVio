The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the road conditions. Despite the posted speed limit being within the driver's speed range, they failed to take into account the advisory speed limit for the sharp curve and the fact that the road was covered in snow and ice. This lack of consideration for the road conditions and the driver's inexperience ultimately led to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent crash.
