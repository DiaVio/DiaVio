The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver of the Ford Expedition was distracted by looking at an exterior site to the right of his vehicle and failed to realize that Vehicle #2 (2004 Dodge Ram 1500) was stopped in front of him. This distraction, combined with the driver's possible drowsiness from the prescription medications he was taking, led to a recognition error and the subsequent rear-end collision with Vehicle #2. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was stopped in the roadway, waiting for several vehicles to pass before making a left turn into a parking lot. The driver of Vehicle #2 did not contribute to the crash as she did not see Vehicle #1 approaching and had no time to react. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of him.
