The driver of V1 stated that his view was obstructed by the parked school bus, preventing him from seeing the stop sign or the eastbound traffic. However, the scene inspection revealed that if V1 was stopped within 10 meters (33 feet) of the intersection, the bus did not obstruct the view of the stop sign or the eastbound traffic. This suggests that V1 did not stop at the appropriate location, which would have allowed for a clear view of the intersection. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), which exceeds the speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) on the intersecting roadway. This indicates that V1 was not driving at a safe and appropriate speed for the road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance, failure to stop at the appropriate location, and exceeding the speed limit.
