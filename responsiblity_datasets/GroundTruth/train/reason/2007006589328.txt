The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted to avoid contact with an unknown vehicle by steering left and braking, which caused them to enter the third southbound lane and collide with V2 (the 2007 Honda Civic) that was stopped at the red light. V1's evasive action was deemed incorrect, and factors such as fatigue and the use of prescription medication for diabetes were associated with the driver of V1.
