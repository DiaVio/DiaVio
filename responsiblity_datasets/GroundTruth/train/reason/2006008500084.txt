The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, which resulted in the collision with V2. The driver's claim of blocked view due to parked cars was not supported by the absence of parked cars at the location upon investigation. Additionally, the presence of shrubbery may have further obstructed the driver's view, but it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to ensure a safe crossing of the intersection.
