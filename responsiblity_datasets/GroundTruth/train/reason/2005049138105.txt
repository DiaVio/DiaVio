The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the lane to the right in order to exit, and in doing so, made contact with the right front side of V2 (the 2003 Oldsmobile Alero). V2, on the other hand, was traveling straight in the first lane and steered right to avoid the collision. Since V1 fled the scene, it indicates a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, suggesting that V1 was not maintaining their lane properly. Therefore, V1's actions of crossing over the lane and causing contact with V2, as well as fleeing the scene, make them primarily responsible for the crash.
