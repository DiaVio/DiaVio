The reason for this is that V2 departed its lane to the left and traveled across multiple lanes of traffic, including the center turn lane, and entered the lane of travel of Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2013 Chevrolet Cruze four-door sedan. This action by V2 caused the collision with V1, resulting in the deployment of V1's airbags and serious injuries to the driver of V1.
