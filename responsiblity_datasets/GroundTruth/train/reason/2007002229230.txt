The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to operating the vehicle and consuming alcohol, which was found in an open container in the vehicle at the scene. The driver also left the scene of the accident and refused to cooperate with the police investigation. Additionally, the driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was tested approximately 8.5 hours after the crash and was found to be 0.104, which is above the legal limit. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired state, leaving the scene of the accident, and crossing official markings.
