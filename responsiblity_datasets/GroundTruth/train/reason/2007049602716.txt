The driver of V1 admitted that he did not realize his friend in V2 was stopped at the red light. This indicates a lack of adequate surveillance and failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead. Despite following at a distance of 4 car lengths, the driver did not maintain proper awareness of the road conditions and failed to react in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
