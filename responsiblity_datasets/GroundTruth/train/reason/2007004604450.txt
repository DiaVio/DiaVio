The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the 2000 Mitsubishi Galant, entered the intersection without observing the traffic signal. V1 admitted to being upset about her father's surgery and thought she had the green light, leading to a recognition error. This emotional factor likely contributed to her failure to recognize the red light and resulted in the collision with V2, the 2001 Ford Crown Victoria. On the other hand, V2, the driver of the Ford Crown Victoria, reported that she was stopped at the intersection and proceeded through when the light turned green. V2 claimed that V1 ran the signal and struck her on the left side. However, since V1's failure to observe the traffic signal was the primary cause of the accident, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible.
