The reason for V1's responsibility is that he made an unsafe lane change without properly checking his blind spot and without ensuring that the lane he was changing into was clear. This resulted in him encountering a phantom vehicle in the lane he intended to change into. Instead of safely maneuvering back into his original lane, V1 attempted to cut back into lane 2, where another vehicle was also changing lanes at the same time. This sudden maneuver, combined with slamming the brakes, caused V1 to lose control of the truck and veer off the roadway to the right. V1's overcompensation and failure to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the truck rolling over and coming to rest on top of a drainage culvert. Although V1 stated that he was trying to avoid hitting any vehicle, his actions of changing lanes without proper caution and awareness contributed to the crash.
