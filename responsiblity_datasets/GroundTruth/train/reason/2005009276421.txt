The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was attempting to turn left from the left turn lane, and it struck Vehicle 2 (Sante Fe) with its front. Vehicle 2 was traveling straight in its lane, and it entered the intersection when Vehicle 1 was turning left. Therefore, Vehicle 1's left turn maneuver resulted in the collision with Vehicle 2, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
