The driver of V1 failed to recognize the stopped traffic ahead and impacted the rear of V2, which then caused V2 to impact the rear of V3. The driver of V1 admitted to being unfamiliar with the rush hour traffic patterns on this roadway and being lost in internal thoughts, possibly related to a meeting he had just attended or the radio he was listening to. This diverted his attention from the driving task, causing a driver recognition error and inattention. Therefore, V1's failure to react to the stopped traffic and misjudgment of speed and gap distance to the forward vehicle led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
