The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the right side of the road, returned to the road, and then traveled off the left side of the road. This indicates poor directional control by the driver of V1, failing to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, physical evidence at the scene suggests that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, which further supports the driver's lack of control. While an animal in the roadway was a contributing factor, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid collisions. In this case, the driver's poor directional control and potential high speed were the primary factors leading to the accident.
