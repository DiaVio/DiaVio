The reason for this is that V2 was parked along the curb in the same lane where the case vehicle was traveling. The case vehicle struck the back-left corner of the trailer, indicating that V2 was stationary and obstructing the lane of travel. As a result, V2 failed to yield the right of way to the case vehicle, leading to the front impact and subsequent injuries to the driver.
