The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 drifted over the left lane line and onto the west shoulder of the road, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the driver overcorrected to the right, leading to a skid and ultimately causing V1 to depart the roadway and impact the embankment. This suggests a lack of control and potentially reckless driving behavior.
