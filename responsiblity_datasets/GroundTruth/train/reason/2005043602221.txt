The reason for this is that V2 admitted to not paying attention to the bus in front of him and attempting to change lanes instead. When he realized that the bus had stopped, he had to slam on the brakes, but it was too late to avoid the collision. This indicates a decision error on the part of V2, as he failed to take appropriate evasive action in response to the stopped bus. Additionally, the fact that V2 is an 18-year-old driver with limited experience may have contributed to his incorrect decision-making in this situation.
