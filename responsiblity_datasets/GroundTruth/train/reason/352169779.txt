The reason for this is that the impact was described as a near side impact, indicating that the Dodge Durango struck the Chevrolet Cobalt on its right side. As a result of this impact, the case occupant sustained multiple injuries, including head trauma and fractures, which were caused by contact with the door panel of the Chevrolet Cobalt. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the Dodge Durango, as it was the striking vehicle in this near side impact.
