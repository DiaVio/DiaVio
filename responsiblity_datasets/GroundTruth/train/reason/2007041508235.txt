The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of the non-contact Honda Accord cut off V1 while changing three lanes to the right, in order to get to the exit lane. This sudden maneuver caused V1 to lose control and weave wildly from side to side, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2. Although the non-contact vehicle did not make physical contact with V1, it was the driver's action that directly caused V1 to lose control and initiate the chain of events leading to the crash.
