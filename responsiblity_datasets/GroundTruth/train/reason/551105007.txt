The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop and locked up the brakes, resulting in the collision with the back side of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1993 International flatbed truck. V1's inability to stop suggests that the driver was either traveling at an excessive speed for the road conditions or failed to maintain a safe following distance, considering the wet roadway surface and the lack of street lights.
