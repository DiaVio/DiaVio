The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver drifted across the yellow dashed line, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the driver overcorrected after drifting, causing the vehicle to skid off the roadway and ultimately collide with trees. The driver's overcompensation and loss of control are considered driver-related factors contributing to the crash. Furthermore, the driver's fatigue, heroin use prior to the crash, inattention due to financial problems, traveling too fast for conditions, and emotional upset are additional factors that contributed to the driver's responsibility for the accident.
