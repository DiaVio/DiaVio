The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 departed the roadway to the right while negotiating a left-handed curve, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's oversteering and counter steering maneuvers further contributed to the loss of control. The multiple impacts with the embankment, utility pole, and tree suggest a lack of proper vehicle control and judgment.
