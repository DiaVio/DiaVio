The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he was driving with a suspended license, which is a violation of traffic laws and indicates that he should not have been operating a vehicle in the first place. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 89 kmph (below the posted speed limit of 105 kmph), suggesting that he was not driving recklessly or at an excessive speed. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, which indicates that V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road. The critical reason for this event was coded as an environment-related factor, specifically the presence of standing water in a sag with no drainage, which caused V1 to hydroplane. While the lack of drainage for the standing water may have contributed to the hydroplaning, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and take necessary precautions when encountering adverse road conditions. In this case, V1's lack of control and subsequent collision with the concrete barrier can be attributed to his own actions and the fact that he was driving with a suspended license.
