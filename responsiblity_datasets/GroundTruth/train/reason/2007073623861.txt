The driver of V1 was distracted by disciplining her daughters and looking at them in the back seat while driving. Additionally, she had a cell phone in her hand, indicating that she was not fully focused on the road. This distraction caused her to fail to notice that V2 and V3 had stopped in front of her, resulting in her vehicle colliding with the back of V2 and subsequently pushing V2 into the back of V3. Therefore, V1's distracted driving and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of her make her primarily responsible for the accident.
