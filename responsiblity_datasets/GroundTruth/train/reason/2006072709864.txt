The reason for this is that Vehicle Two was struck on its right side by the front of Vehicle One (1998 Dodge Caravan), indicating that Vehicle Two encroached into the path of Vehicle One. Since both vehicles were traveling in straight paths and Vehicle One's front plane impacted Vehicle Two's side plane, it can be inferred that Vehicle One had the right of way and Vehicle Two failed to yield or crossed into the intersection without giving way.
