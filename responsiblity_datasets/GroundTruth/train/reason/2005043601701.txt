The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by staring at a flowerbed and lost control of her vehicle. Additionally, the driver admitted to overcompensating her recovery effort after realizing she had driven off the road. The presence of fatigue due to her work schedule and the possibility of falling asleep further contribute to her responsibility for the accident.
