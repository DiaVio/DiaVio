The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the roadway before turning left. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 prior to the impact, indicating a failure to detect oncoming traffic. This failure to properly observe the roadway and anticipate the presence of other vehicles led to V1 pulling out in front of V2, resulting in the collision.
