V3 attempted to pass V1 on the right side, which is an illegal maneuver. This resulted in contact between V3 and V1, causing V1 to be forced off the road. As a result, V1 then entered the exit ramp and collided with V2. Therefore, V3's illegal maneuver and attempt to pass on the right side ultimately led to the chain of events that caused the crash.
