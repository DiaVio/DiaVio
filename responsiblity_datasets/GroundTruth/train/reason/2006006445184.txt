The driver of V1 passed out behind the wheel, which was determined to be a result of a physical impairment, possibly related to his diabetes. This impairment caused V1 to strike the rear of V2 (the 2001 Honda Accord) and subsequently collide with V3 (the 2001 Pontiac Bonneville) in the oncoming lane. V1's unconscious state and inability to control the vehicle directly led to the chain of events that resulted in the crash.
