The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn across oncoming traffic, and the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The critical reason coded for V2 was "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver did not look or failed to see the oncoming V1. This assumption that oncoming vehicles would stop while completing the left turn was an associated factor in the crash.
