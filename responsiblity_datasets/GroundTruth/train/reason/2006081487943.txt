The driver of V1 was traveling at an unsafe speed, above the posted speed limit, and was inexperienced, having been licensed to drive for less than 7 months. The driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle when encountering an uninvolved pickup backing out of a driveway. Instead of accurately assessing the situation and realizing that the pickup had already stopped, the driver overreacted and overcompensated in their steering, causing the vehicle to veer off the roadway, impact a shrub and mailbox, and ultimately roll over. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their unsafe speed, inexperience, and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
