The reason for this is that V1, driven by an 89-year-old male, admitted that his foot slipped off the brake and he mistakenly pressed on the gas pedal instead of the brake. This poor directional control caused V1 to shoot out from the driveway and strike the left side of V2. Although V2 was traveling slightly over the speed limit, it is not believed to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's performance error and poor directional control.
