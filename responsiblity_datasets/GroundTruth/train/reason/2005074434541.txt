The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by poor vehicle performance and related noises. She noticed the traffic light turn yellow and attempted to accelerate to clear the intersection. However, when her vehicle did not respond, she noticed the light turn red and tried to stop. The witness following V1 also stated that the driver ran two red lights prior to the incident. Additionally, there were no brake lights observed from V1 before the crash. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior, failure to stop at red lights, and potential brake issues contribute to her primary responsibility for the accident.
