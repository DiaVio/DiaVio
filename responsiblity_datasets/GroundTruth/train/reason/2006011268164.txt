The reason for this is that V1, the green Pontiac Bonneville, was engaged in aggressive driving behavior by attempting to pass the pick-up truck in the eastbound lane. This action resulted in V1 colliding with V2, the Ford Taurus, which was in the process of making a left turn into a private driveway. V1 then left the scene of the crash, indicating a hit and run situation.
