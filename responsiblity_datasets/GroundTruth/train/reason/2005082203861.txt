The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, specifically racing with another vehicle on the westbound roadway. This behavior led to the driver being unable to complete the left turn at the intersection at the speed they were traveling. As a result, V1 left the southbound roadway, struck a pole, and came to rest. The presence of skid marks on the concrete and painted crosswalk, corresponding to the left and right tires of V1, indicate that the vehicle was traveling at a high speed through the turn. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior and excessive speed are the primary factors that led to the collision.
