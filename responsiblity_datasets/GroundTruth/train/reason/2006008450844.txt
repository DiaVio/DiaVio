The reason for this is that the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically incorrect evasive action. This suggests that V1 did not take the appropriate action to avoid the deer in the roadway, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a utility pole. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 steered right, which indicates that there was an opportunity for the driver to potentially avoid the collision by steering left or taking a different evasive action. However, without an interview with the driver, it is not possible to determine the exact circumstances or reasons behind the incorrect evasive action. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action.
