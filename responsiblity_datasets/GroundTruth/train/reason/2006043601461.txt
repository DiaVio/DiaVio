The reason for this is that V1 was traveling south and entered the intersection with a red signal, indicating that they did not have the right of way. V2 (the driver of the 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass) was traveling east and entered the intersection with a green signal, indicating that they had the right of way. V1's failure to stop at the red signal and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 fled the scene after the crash raises suspicion and suggests that they may have been aware of their responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their disregard for the traffic signal and subsequent fleeing from the scene.
