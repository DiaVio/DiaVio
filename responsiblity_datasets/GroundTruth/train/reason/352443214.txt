The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 missed the westbound exit ramp deceleration lane while attempting to change lanes to the right. As a result, Vehicle 1 departed the roadway and struck and under rode the back plane of Vehicle 2's cargo trailer. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to properly navigate the roadway and maintain control of their vehicle, leading to the collision.
