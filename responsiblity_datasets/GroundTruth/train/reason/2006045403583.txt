The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling over the speed limit, between 97 and 113 kmph (60 and 70 mph), which is too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. The driver of V1 swerved to the left to avoid contact with the unknown vehicle, but this evasive action was unsuccessful, resulting in V1 striking the concrete barrier. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed that the unknown vehicle made contact with V1, but there was no evidence found on V1 or on the roadway to support this claim. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and unsuccessful evasive action make it primarily responsible for the crash.
