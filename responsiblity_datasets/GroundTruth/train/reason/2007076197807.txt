The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a sixteen-year-old male, was distracted by an internal factor. He was engaged in a playful argument with his passenger about which CD to listen to and was swatting at her hands while steering with his left hand. This distraction caused him to take his eyes off the road and lose control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted that he was looking inside the vehicle towards the CD player and failed to notice that he was going too fast until it was too late. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the driver was relatively inexperienced, having only been driving for 2 months, and this was his first time driving on this particular roadway. This lack of experience may have contributed to his inability to properly assess and control the speed of the vehicle. Overall, the driver's distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle due to inattentiveness make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
