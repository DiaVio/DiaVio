The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. This is evident from the driver's statement that they noticed traffic slowing/stopping ahead, but were unable to brake and steer in time to avoid colliding with V2 (the 2004 Volkswagen Passat). As a result, V1 departed the road, impacted the center divider, and then collided with the rear of V2. V2, on the other hand, was stopped well in advance of the non-contacted vehicle and was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, V2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the crash. V3's driver was not interviewed, and there is no information indicating their involvement in the first harmful event. Therefore, V3's responsibility cannot be determined based on the given case summary.
