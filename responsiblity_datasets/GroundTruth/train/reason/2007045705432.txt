The reason for this is that V2 was traveling west through the intersection in lane one when it struck V1, which was turning left/north from lane three on the west leg of the intersection. V2 stated that he thought V1 would stop, indicating a false assumption that the other vehicle would yield the right of way. Therefore, V2 failed to yield to V1, resulting in the collision.
