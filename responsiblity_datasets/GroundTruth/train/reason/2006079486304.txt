The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed in congested traffic, which was deemed "too fast for conditions." Additionally, the driver of V1 had limited experience driving on this road and was not familiar with the area. These factors, combined with the driver's fatigue from working long hours, likely contributed to their inability to react in time to avoid colliding with V2. V2 (the 2001 BMW) was stopped in the southbound number one lane, indicating that they were not actively contributing to the collision. The driver of V2 attempted to steer right to avoid the collision, further suggesting that they were not at fault. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their excessive speed, lack of familiarity with the road, and failure to adapt to the congested traffic conditions.
