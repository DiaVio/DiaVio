The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to looking to the right to change lanes and not paying attention to the slowing of V2 in front of her. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and failed to respond appropriately to the deceleration of the vehicle in front. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; following too closely to respond to unexpected actions."
