V2 was traveling westbound and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling northbound. V2 pulled out from the stop sign without adequately surveilling the intersection and did not see V1 approaching. This lack of surveillance and failure to see V1 resulted in the collision between V2 and V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
