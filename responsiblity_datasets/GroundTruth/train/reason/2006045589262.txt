The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 attempted to make a left turn onto the side street too early, 29 meters before the intersection. This resulted in the vehicle going down a steep embankment and ultimately crashing. The driver's confusion and poor directional control, along with the obstruction of view caused by debris on the instrument panel, contributed to the recognition error and the failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver's poor vision, as indicated by the need for eye surgery to correct cataracts, and her multiple health problems, including diabetes and heart conditions, may have further impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's errors and impairments.
