The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drove off the right side of the road and collided with a tree. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper control while driving on a snowy road. The driver's inability to stay on the road and the subsequent collision with the tree suggest negligence or error on their part, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
