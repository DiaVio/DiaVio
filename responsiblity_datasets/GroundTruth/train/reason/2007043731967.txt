The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane" and the critical reason for the critical event was coded as "incorrect evasive action." Additionally, other factors coded to the driver of V1 include "chose inappropriate evasive action" and "poor directional control (failure to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." This suggests that V1 made a mistake in attempting to avoid the unknown vehicle that cut in front of them, resulting in a collision with V2 and subsequent spinning across all travel lanes.
