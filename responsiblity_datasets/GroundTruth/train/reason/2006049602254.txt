The reason for this is that V1 was reported to have moved to the right and struck the left side of V2 (1999 Dodge Ram pickup). This indicates that V1 made an improper lane change, encroaching into the adjacent lane where V2 was traveling. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," suggesting that V1 was not maintaining proper lane position. While the driver of V2 was reported to have encroached over the left lane line, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. Therefore, based on the available information, V1's improper lane change and failure to maintain lane position make them primarily responsible for the crash.
