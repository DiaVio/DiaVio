The driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which is a driver-related factor. This resulted in V1 veering to the right and partially entering lane four. When the driver woke up and realized the impending rear-end collision, they made a sudden steering movement to the left, causing V1 to depart the roadway and collide with the concrete median. The driver's fatigue, caused by working night shifts and not getting any sleep the night before, contributed to the driver falling asleep at the wheel. This lack of sleep and fatigue impaired the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle, ultimately leading to the crash.
