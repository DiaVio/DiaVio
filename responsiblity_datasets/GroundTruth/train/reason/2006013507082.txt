The driver of V1 entered the intersection under a red light, indicating a failure to obey traffic signals. Additionally, the driver admitted that her foot slipped off the brake while attempting to soothe a fussing infant in the back seat, suggesting driver inattention and distraction. These factors, combined with the placement of the crash within the left lane of traffic, indicate that V1 did not yield the right of way to oncoming vehicles in the eastbound travel lanes.
