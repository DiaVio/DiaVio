The reason for this is that V2 struck V1 (the 2004 Jeep Wrangler Limited) in the left side, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, the fact that V1 was traveling through the intersection and V2 was traveling in the through lane suggests that V2 may have disregarded the traffic light or failed to stop when required.
