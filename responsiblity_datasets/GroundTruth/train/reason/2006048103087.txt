The driver of V1 stated that they steered right into lane one in an attempt to avoid a non-contact vehicle that encroached from their left into lane two. However, the driver's evasive action was deemed incorrect, resulting in the collision with V2 (the Volvo tractor-trailer). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their incorrect evasive action.
