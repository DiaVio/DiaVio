The reason for this is that the driver of V2 made a false assumption about the actions of the driver of V1 (the 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML320). The driver of V2 assumed that V1 would go through the second set of traffic lights after he went through the first set. This false assumption led to the driver of V2 failing to maintain a safe distance and subsequently rear-ending V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering right, but was unable to prevent the collision. This suggests that the driver of V2 was not able to react in time or take appropriate evasive action to avoid the accident. Furthermore, the wet road conditions may have contributed to the accident as an associated factor. However, it is important to note that the driver of V1 was not thought to have contributed to the crash, indicating that their actions were not a significant factor in causing the accident. Overall, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the false assumption of the actions of the driver of V1 and the failure to maintain a safe distance.
