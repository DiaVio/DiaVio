The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1998 Toyota Camry) at a controlled intersection. V1 entered the intersection while V2 had already started to turn left on a green arrow. This indicates that V1 did not recognize the traffic control or made a false assumption that V2 would yield to their vehicle. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 became aware of V2's presence just prior to the first impact and steered left as an avoidance action. This suggests that V1's lack of attention or failure to recognize the situation contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and their potential driver error make them primarily responsible for the accident.
