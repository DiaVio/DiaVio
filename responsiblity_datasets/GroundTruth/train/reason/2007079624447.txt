The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting a left turn at the intersection. Despite seeing the approaching vehicle, the driver of V1 believed it was far enough away to make the turn. This misjudgment led to the collision. V2 (the driver of the Toyota Rav-4) was not primarily responsible for the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. However, the critical reason was not coded to V2, indicating that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2 while making a left turn at the intersection.
