The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and turned left across the path of V2, who had the right of way. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, but was unable to avoid hitting V1. V1's failure to yield and make a safe turn resulted in the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 was charged with DUI and driving with a revoked license, indicating a disregard for traffic laws and safety.
