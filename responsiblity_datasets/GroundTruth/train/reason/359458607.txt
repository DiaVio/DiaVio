The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in lane one of a two-lane, two-way roadway but drifted out of the lane and departed the roadway to the right. V1 then collided with two trees, resulting in the deployment of both frontal airbags. The rotation and final rest position of V1 indicate that it was the vehicle that veered off the road and caused the accident.
