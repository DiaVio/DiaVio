The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they swerved into the oncoming traffic lane (lane two of the northbound lane) in an attempt to avoid hitting V2 (the driver of the 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee) who was making a left turn into the parking lot. However, in doing so, V1's vehicle collided with the right rear corner of V2's vehicle. Subsequently, V1's vehicle continued heading left into the northbound lane and collided with V3 (the driver of the 2005 Dodge Magnum) in the front. V1's inadequate evasive action and failure to maintain control of their vehicle resulted in the collision with both V2 and V3, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
