The driver of V1 stated that she was driving in her lane when she noticed the other vehicle encroaching into her lane. She tried to alert the driver by beeping her horn, but the other vehicle continued to move into her lane. To avoid a collision, she steered to the left and hit her brakes, which caused her to lose control of her vehicle and roll over in the grassy median. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V2 was the one who moved into V1's lane. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the crash was coded as a driver-related error of overcompensation, suggesting that V1's evasive actions were a response to V2's encroachment. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash because they failed to maintain their lane and caused V1 to take evasive action, resulting in the loss of control and rollover.
