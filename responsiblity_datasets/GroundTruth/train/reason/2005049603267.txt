The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 did not notice V2 (the 2004 Suzuki Verona) approaching from the northbound lanes, as she was looking straight ahead and not to her left. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision between V1 and V2.
