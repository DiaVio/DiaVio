The driver of V1 was observed weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating, and speeding prior to the crash. This erratic driving behavior, as reported by a witness who called the police, indicates a lack of proper control and disregard for traffic laws. Additionally, the driver's admission of being sick and taking medication raises concerns about their physical and mental state at the time of the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. This, combined with the witness's account of the driver's erratic behavior, suggests that the driver's poor directional control and failure to drive with the skill ordinarily expected led to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's reckless driving and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
