The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and continued to travel in a westerly direction with a slight right turning travel path, crossing multiple lanes of traffic and ultimately colliding with the embankment. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to properly navigate the intersection, resulting in the collision.
