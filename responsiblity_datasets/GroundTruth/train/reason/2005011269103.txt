The driver of V1 turned left on a red signal at the intersection, which is a violation of traffic laws. This action resulted in V1 crossing into the path of V2 (the 2002 Peterbuilt 357 CBE tractor trailer semi-truck), causing the collision. Although the driver of V2 noticed V1 moving across his lane and attempted to brake, the responsibility for the crash lies with V1 for making an illegal left turn on a red signal.
