V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and struck the right side of V2 (the 2002 Ford Expedition). V1 then rotated and struck the right side of V3 (the 2000 Volkswagen Jetta). The critical reason for V1's involvement in the accident was a "degraded braking capability" as reported by the driver. This indicates that V1's brakes were not functioning properly, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to stop or slow down in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and the degraded braking capability are the reasons why V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
