The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection while making a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. Even though V1 (the driver of the Chevrolet Cavalier) stated that her shoe was stuck under the brake pedal, it is ultimately the responsibility of V2 to ensure that the intersection is clear before proceeding with the left turn. V2's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
