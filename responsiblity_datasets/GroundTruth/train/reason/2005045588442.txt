The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap distance and panicked when realizing they couldn't make it across to the center turn lane, resulting in stopping in the eastbound lanes. This decision error and misjudgment of the gap or other's speed led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (the 2001 Nissan Sentra).
