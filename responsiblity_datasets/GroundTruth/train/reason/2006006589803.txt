The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right-of-way, veered right, and departed the roadway. The witness reported that the driver of V1 was speeding through the intersection at approximately 80kmph (50 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). Additionally, the witness stated that the driver of V1 departed the roadway and hit the wall for some unknown reason. Therefore, V1's actions of entering the intersection without the right-of-way, speeding, and veering off the road indicate that the driver of V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
