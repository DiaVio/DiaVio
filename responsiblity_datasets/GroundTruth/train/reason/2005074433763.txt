The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to recognize the red traffic light and proceeded through the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1. The driver of V2 was found to be daydreaming and not paying attention, which was identified as the critical reason for the event. Additionally, the driver's view of eastbound traffic was partially obstructed by the hillcrest, fence, pole, and trash bin, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to see the red light and the approaching V1.
