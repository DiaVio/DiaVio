The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted by looking at a nearby construction site, failed to look far enough ahead to see the stopped traffic, and was running late to get back to work. Additionally, the driver was not licensed and had several prescription medications with him at the time of the crash. The fact that Vehicle #1's left rear wheel was missing a lug nut may have also had some bearing on the handling of the vehicle.
