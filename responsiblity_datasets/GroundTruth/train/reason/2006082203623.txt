The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to traveling "too fast" for the curve and sliding on the wet pavement, which caused the vehicle to cross over the left lane line. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to adjust their speed appropriately for the road conditions. While V2 (the driver of the 1996 Freightliner tractor) did turn left from the driveway and was in the center turn lane, their actions alone do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident. V2 stated that they looked both ways before entering the roadway and believed that V1 was traveling at the speed limit, giving them enough time to merge safely. However, it is important to note that V2's minimal information and lack of coding for the critical reason of the pre-crash event may indicate a potential contributory factor. Further investigation may be required to determine if there were any additional factors that could have contributed to the accident.
