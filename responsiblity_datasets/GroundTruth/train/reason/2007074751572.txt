The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, and V2 (the driver of the 1997 Mercury Tracer) had the right of way as they were traveling straight in their lane. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking on the phone and reaching for their cell phone when it rang. This distraction likely contributed to their failure to notice V2 approaching and take appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and their distracted driving make them primarily responsible for the accident.
