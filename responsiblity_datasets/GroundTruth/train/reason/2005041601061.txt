The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that it was disabled and left unattended in the middle of the entrance ramp. This created a hazardous situation for other vehicles entering the ramp, including V1 (the 2001 Jeep Cherokee). V2's presence on the ramp without proper warning or indication of its disabled state contributed to the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed." Although the critical reason for V2 was not explicitly mentioned, the fact that it was disabled and unable to move off to the side of the road suggests that it was not able to maintain a safe speed or position on the ramp. Therefore, V2's failure to properly address its disabled state and its presence in the middle of the entrance ramp make it primarily responsible for the accident.
