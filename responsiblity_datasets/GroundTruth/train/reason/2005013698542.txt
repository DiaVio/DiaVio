The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver took incorrect evasive action when the trailer started to sway. Instead of hitting the throttle to stabilize the trailer, the driver pressed down on the brake pedal, which caused the trailer to sway even more. Additionally, it is noted that the truck was loaded on the trailer the wrong way, with the weight not properly distributed on the hitch of the towing vehicle.
