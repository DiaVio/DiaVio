The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it lost control while exiting a left curve, traveled off the right side road edge, and impacted an unknown object with its right front wheel. V1 then steered back onto the road before traveling off the south road edge and began to rollover, impacting trees and a rock before coming to its final resting position on its left side. This sequence of events suggests that V1's driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve, resulting in the loss of control and subsequent rollover. The driver's actions of steering back onto the road and then traveling off the road again indicate a lack of proper control and decision-making, contributing to the crash. Additionally, the severe injuries sustained by the driver suggest that the crash was a result of V1's actions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the frontal crash.
