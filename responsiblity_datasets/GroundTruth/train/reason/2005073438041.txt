The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without being given the right of way. Although V1 had activated its lights, it did not activate the siren, which is required by law to request the right of way. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed without the siren, which could have alerted other drivers to its presence and allowed them to yield. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to follow proper protocol in requesting the right of way contributed to the collision with V2.
