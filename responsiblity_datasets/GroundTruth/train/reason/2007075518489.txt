The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for traffic and rear-ended V2 (the 2001 Honda Accord) while it was stopped in lane two. V1's driver admitted to being distracted by adjusting the radio and not noticing that traffic had stopped ahead. This distraction caused V1 to fail to apply the brakes in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and react in a timely manner to the stopped traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
