The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and rear-ended V2 (the Honda Accord) while it was stopped in the eastbound lane. V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down at his road map while driving, which led to him not noticing V2 in time to stop. Additionally, V1 stated that if the ground were not wet, he would have had time to stop, indicating that he was not maintaining a safe following distance considering the road conditions. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in the appropriate lane, waiting to turn left into an intersecting driveway. V2 was not found to have any critical reasons or associated factors contributing to the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain attention and adjust his driving behavior to the wet road conditions makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
