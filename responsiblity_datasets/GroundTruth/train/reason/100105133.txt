The reason for this is that the driver of V1 allowed the front of their vehicle to strike the back of Vehicle 2 (V2) in a minor impact while both vehicles were moving forward. This initial collision indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining a safe distance or paying sufficient attention to the road ahead. Furthermore, after the collision with V2, V1 continued forward and went straight without any driver input, crossing the painted median and the westbound lanes before ultimately colliding with a large palm tree. This suggests a lack of control or proper steering by the driver of V1, contributing to the accident.
