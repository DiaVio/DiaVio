The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 stated that Vehicle 2 suddenly merged into her lane, striking the front left corner of her vehicle. This indicates that Vehicle 2 made an improper lane change, causing the initial collision. Additionally, Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3 fled the scene, which further suggests their involvement in the crash and their attempt to avoid responsibility. However, it is important to note that without further information or interviews with the drivers of Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3, it is difficult to determine the exact circumstances and factors that led to the crash.
