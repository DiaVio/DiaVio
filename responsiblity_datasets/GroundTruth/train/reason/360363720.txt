The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it departed the roadway to the left while entering a curve, resulting in the front impact with the embankment. This initial departure from the roadway led to the subsequent rollover and impacts with trees and a rock, ultimately causing V1 to come to a final rest on its top.
