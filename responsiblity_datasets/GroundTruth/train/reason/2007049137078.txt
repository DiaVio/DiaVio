The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they entered the intersection on a red light, indicating a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, V1 stated that they were unsure of the color of the traffic light when they entered the intersection, suggesting a lack of attention and inadequate surveillance. V2 (the driver of the Dodge Durango) had the right of way as they were traveling westbound and V1 was crossing their path. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment," indicating that V1's actions caused the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and their inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
