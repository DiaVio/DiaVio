The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it hydroplaned across all lanes of the highway, indicating a loss of control. Additionally, the investigation revealed that the tires on V1 had insufficient tread depth and were underinflated, which contributed to the loss of control. The driver's claim of traveling below the speed limit was contradicted by the investigating officer, who stated that V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit. Therefore, V1's hydroplaning, combined with the poor condition of the tires, ultimately led to the collision.
