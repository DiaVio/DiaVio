The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection and failed to recognize the presence of V2 (the Nissan Altima). The witness at the scene indicated that the traffic signal was in the red phase as V1 approached, suggesting that V1 ran a red light. Additionally, the researcher formed the opinion that V1 was engaged in a phone conversation during the crash, which may have distracted her and contributed to her failure to notice V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and potential distraction from phone use are the primary reasons for their responsibility in the collision.
