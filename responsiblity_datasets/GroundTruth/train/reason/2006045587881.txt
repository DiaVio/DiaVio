The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the traffic signal, disregarding a red light. The driver's inattention and failure to focus on the road, as well as potential fatigue and the influence of medication, contributed to the driver's failure to stop. Additionally, the data extracted from the vehicle's electronic data recorder (EDR) indicates that the driver was traveling at a high speed prior to the crash, further demonstrating a lack of attention and disregard for traffic laws.
