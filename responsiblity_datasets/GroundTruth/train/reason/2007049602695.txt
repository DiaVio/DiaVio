The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to V2 (the 2001 Nissan Maxima) and was unable to respond effectively to V2's actions. This is indicated by the fact that V1's critical reason for the critical event was coded as "following too close to respond to other vehicle's action." Additionally, V1's relatively long post trajectory and the driver's attempt to steer to the left instead of applying the brakes suggest that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed and was unable to avoid the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Nissan Maxima) was slowing down with the intention to turn right into the restaurant parking lot and had the right turn signal activated. There is no indication that V2 made any sudden or unexpected maneuvers that would contribute to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to following too closely and traveling at an excessive speed.
