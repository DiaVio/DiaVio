The driver of V1 admitted to not looking to see if she had the right-of-way before proceeding through the intersection. She stated that she did not see V2 because the semi-truck was blocking her view. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and an inexperienced driver. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with her friends, which further contributed to her failure to observe the traffic situation correctly. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that he saw V1 and the broken-down semi-truck. He proceeded with caution and wondered if V1 was going to attempt to turn or if she saw him. He did not have time to apply the brakes but did take his foot off the accelerator. This suggests that the driver of V2 was aware of the situation and took some evasive action. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance, distraction, and failure to yield the right-of-way.
