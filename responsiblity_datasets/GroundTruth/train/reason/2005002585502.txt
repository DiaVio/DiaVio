The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to crossing the centerline into the northbound lane while negotiating the curve. This action caused the collision with Vehicle #2 (the Freightliner School Bus). The police also issued a citation to the driver of Vehicle #1 for failure to keep right. The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane. The driver stated that the steering wheel would not turn, indicating a steering failure. However, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that their vehicle is in proper working condition before operating it on the road. The driver's inability to return to their lane and their failure to take appropriate action to avoid the collision contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
