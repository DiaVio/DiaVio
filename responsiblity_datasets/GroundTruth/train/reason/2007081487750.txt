The reason for this is that V1 failed to negotiate the curve to the left, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and causing the subsequent collision with the rock wall, street sign, mailbox, and garbage cans. The driver's admission to taking oxycontin for chronic pain and subsequent arrest for DUI suggests impairment, which could have contributed to the poor directional control and inability to navigate the curve properly. Additionally, the associated factors of medication, alcohol, and traveling too fast for the curve further support V1's responsibility for the accident.
