The driver of Vehicle one stated that she saw Vehicle two in the intersection but was unable to stop in time, indicating that she failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle two. This is supported by the fact that Vehicle two was making a left turn, which typically has the right of way over vehicles going straight. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one reported a false assumption that the traffic light was green, further indicating a failure to obey traffic signals.
