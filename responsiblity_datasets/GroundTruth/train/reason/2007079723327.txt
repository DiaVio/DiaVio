The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the velocity and distance to the forward vehicle (V2) and was unable to stop in time to avoid the impact. The driver of V1 admitted to following V2 at a distance of just one car length, which was not enough distance to stop in time after V2 had stopped. This indicates a failure to maintain a safe following distance and exercise proper surveillance. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 rarely drives this route and is uncomfortable driving on it at night. This lack of familiarity with the road and discomfort driving at night may have contributed to the driver's misjudgment and inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their misjudgment of the gap and speed of the forward vehicle (V2) and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
