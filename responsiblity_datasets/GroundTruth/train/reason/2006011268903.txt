The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control on the wet pavement while negotiating the right-hand curved highway ramp. This indicates a decision error of traveling too fast for the curve. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that there were vehicles in front and next to him as the ramp joined the collector lane, and he had to brake and steer right to avoid hitting the other vehicles. This suggests that V1 was not able to successfully merge and was traveling faster than the vehicles already in the lane. Therefore, V1's failure to control the vehicle on the wet pavement, traveling too fast for the curve, and inability to merge safely into the collector lane make them primarily responsible for the crash.
