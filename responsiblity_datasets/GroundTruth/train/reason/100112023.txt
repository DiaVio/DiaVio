The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise and collide with a stop sign post and a concrete block wall. Additionally, V2 fled the scene and backed into the front plane of V1. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way and left the scene of the accident, showing a lack of responsibility and accountability.
