The driver of V1 admitted that he was not paying attention to the traffic ahead and failed to stop in time, resulting in a rear-end collision with V2. The driver's claim of brake failure was contradicted by the lack of skid marks and the statement from his father, who confirmed that there were no issues with the brakes. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for the crash for failure to use due care. Therefore, V1's driver's inattention and failure to stop in time make them primarily responsible for the accident.
