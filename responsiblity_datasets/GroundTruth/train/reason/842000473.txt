The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was the only vehicle involved in the accident and it was the one that departed the pavement, struck a roadside ditch culvert, a mailbox, and a cluster of trees before coming to rest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was also injured in the crash, indicating that they were in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident.
