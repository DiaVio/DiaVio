The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed its lane to the left, crossed over a painted median, and entered the oncoming lane of travel, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2 (the 2011 Ford F-250 large pickup truck). This indicates that Vehicle 1 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain its proper position on the road, leading to the collision.
