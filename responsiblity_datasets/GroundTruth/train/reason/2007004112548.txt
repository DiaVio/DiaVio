The driver of V1 admitted to being tired and daydreaming, which led to her taking her eyes off the road and not realizing that V2 was slowing down. This inattention and failure to react in time resulted in V1 striking the rear of V2, which then caused a chain reaction involving V3 and V4. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's fatigue, inattention, and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
