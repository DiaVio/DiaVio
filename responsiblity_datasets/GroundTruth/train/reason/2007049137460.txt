The reason for this is that V1 was entering the roadway from the gas station and failed to adequately surveil the traffic before making the right turn. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic, including V2, before entering the roadway. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1993 Nissan Maxima) was already eastbound in lane two and was in the process of changing lanes to lane three. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment-from driveway, turning into same direction." This suggests that V2 was already in the correct lane and V1's failure to properly surveil the traffic resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the traffic before making the right turn.
