The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 lost control and departed the roadway, striking the center guardrail with its front and then spinning counter-clockwise, ultimately striking the same guardrail with its right rear side. The driver of Vehicle #1 claimed that an uninvolved vehicle moving from the driving lane to the passing lane caused him to take evasive action, leading to the loss of control. However, since there were no witnesses or evidence to support this claim, it cannot be considered a valid reason for the crash. Additionally, it should be noted that the driver of Vehicle #1 was driving a rented vehicle, which may suggest unfamiliarity with the vehicle and its handling characteristics. Furthermore, the fact that one of the passengers, a 9-year-old child, was not wearing a seatbelt is a contributing factor to the severity of the injuries sustained. Overall, the primary responsibility for the crash lies with the driver of Vehicle #1 due to the loss of control and departure from the roadway.
