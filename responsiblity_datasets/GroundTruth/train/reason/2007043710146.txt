The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and recognize that V2 (the Ford F-550) was stopped in her lane. This is evident from the fact that V1's critical pre-crash event was "Other vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped" and the critical reason for the event was "Inadequate surveillance, failed to look far enough ahead." Additionally, V1's inexperience as a driver, with only three years of driving experience, may have contributed to her failure to recognize the stopped vehicle. Furthermore, V1's distraction from talking and laughing with her passengers could have also played a role in her failure to notice V2. Although there was a sightline restriction caused by a non-contact vehicle in front of V1, it is ultimately V1's responsibility to maintain a safe distance and be aware of her surroundings. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford F-550) is not primarily responsible for the accident. While V2 did run out of gas and stall in the roadway, he took appropriate action by turning left into a driveway to get out of the flow of traffic. He also attempted to guide traffic around his truck while waiting for assistance. However, V2 should have had proper warning devices, such as roadway flares or a safety vest, to ensure the safety of other drivers. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to surveil the road ahead, her inexperience as a driver, and possible distraction from talking with her passengers. V2, although not primarily responsible, should have had proper warning devices to alert other drivers of his stalled vehicle.
