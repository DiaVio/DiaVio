The reason for this is that V1 lost traction while negotiating a left-hand curve, which caused it to skid on the wet grass and ultimately resulted in the vehicle departing the road and colliding with multiple trees. The driver's application of brakes in an attempt to decelerate also contributed to the loss of control.
