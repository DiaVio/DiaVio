The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 drifted onto the right shoulder and then abruptly steered to the left, causing the vehicle to enter a counterclockwise rotation and cross the northbound lanes. V1 then departed the left side of the road and tripped over its right wheels when reaching the south edge of the median turnaround access road. This series of actions by the driver of V1 ultimately led to the vehicle rolling over and coming to rest on its roof in the median.
