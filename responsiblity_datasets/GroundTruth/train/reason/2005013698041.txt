The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 attempted to pass Vehicle 1 on the left side while Vehicle 1 was in the process of making a left turn at the intersection. Vehicle 2 made a false assumption about the intentions of Vehicle 1 and failed to recognize that Vehicle 1 was in the process of turning. This resulted in the contact between the RF corner of Vehicle 2 and the left rear of Vehicle 1. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 2 stated that she had seen another vehicle pass Vehicle 1 before her, indicating that passing on the left side was not a safe maneuver in this situation. The driver of Vehicle 2 also mentioned that the turn signals of Vehicle 1 did not warn her of the intended left turn, but it is the responsibility of the passing vehicle (Vehicle 2) to ensure that it is safe to pass. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to attempting to pass in an unsafe manner and making false assumptions about the actions of other road users.
