The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to negotiate the right turning curve and stop at the intersection as intended. Instead, Vehicle 1 traveled into and through the intersection, ultimately colliding with an embankment and two small vertical metal sign posts. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 may have been distracted or made an error in judgment, leading to the accident.
