The witness traveling westbound stated that V1 was across the centerline and was eastbound in the westbound lane, which indicates that V1 was driving in the wrong direction. Additionally, the pre-crash critical event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane on the left side of the travel lane," further supporting the fact that V1 was driving in the wrong lane. Furthermore, contributing factors coded to V1 include an elevated blood alcohol level (0.20 per autopsy report) and driving the wrong way on the road. These factors suggest that V1 was impaired and made a serious error in judgment by driving in the opposite direction. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driving in the wrong lane, being impaired, and making a serious driving error.
