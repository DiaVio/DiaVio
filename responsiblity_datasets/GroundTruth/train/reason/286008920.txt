The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and entered the intersection, colliding with the left side of V1, the 2003 four-door Toyota Matrix, which was already in the intersection. V2's frontal plane impacted the left side plane of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, it is mentioned that the intersection was controlled by traffic signals, which suggests that V2 may have run a red light or failed to obey the traffic signal, further supporting the conclusion that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
