The reason for this is that V1 impacted the back of V2 (the 2003 International M/H truck) while it was stopped at an intersection, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the vehicle ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene on foot without exchanging any information, which is a violation of traffic laws and shows a lack of responsibility. Although the condition of the roadway, including the rain, wet roads, and potholes, may have contributed to the crash, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver of V1 to maintain control of their vehicle and drive safely, regardless of the road conditions.
