The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling north and entered the intersection when its traffic light was red. This indicates a clear violation of traffic laws and a failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was crossing through the intersection with a green light. Additionally, witnesses reported that the driver of Vehicle 2 was at fault, further supporting the conclusion that Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
