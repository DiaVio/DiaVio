The reason for this is that V1's driver blacked out while driving, crossed the center turn lane to the left, and impacted the left side of V2. This indicates that V1's driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle due to a physical impairment (heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act). The fact that V1 continued on, jumping the curb, impacting a fence, and traveling down a ravine further supports the driver's inability to control the vehicle.
