The reason for V1's responsibility is that they made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Pontiac Grand Am). V1 stated that they saw the non-contact vehicle turning right and believed that V2 would stop. However, V2 did not stop and collided with the left side of V1 as it was turning left onto the five-lane roadway. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
