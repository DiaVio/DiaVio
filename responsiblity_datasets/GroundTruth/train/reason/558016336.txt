The reason for this is that V2 made a left turn across the path of the case vehicle (V1), the 1996 Volkswagen Jetta, resulting in a collision. V2 was traveling in the left-turn lane, indicating an intention to turn, and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling straight in the westbound lane. This failure to yield and the subsequent collision caused both vehicles to rotate counterclockwise and resulted in V1 departing the roadway and striking a guardrail. Therefore, V2's improper left turn and failure to yield the right of way are the primary factors that led to the accident.
