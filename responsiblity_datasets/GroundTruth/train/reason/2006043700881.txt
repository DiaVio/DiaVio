The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 had a recognition error of inadequate surveillance, which means that they failed to properly observe and anticipate the presence of V2 (the 1997 Dodge Dakota) before entering the intersection. This is supported by the fact that V1's critical pre-crash event was crossing over the intersection, indicating that V1 was the vehicle in motion at the time of the collision. Additionally, V1's driver stated that he was making lunch deliveries for work and may have been rushing to complete more deliveries, which could have contributed to his inadequate surveillance and failure to avoid the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the 1997 Dodge Dakota) had waited at the red light for approximately 30 seconds before proceeding on green, indicating that V2 had the right of way and was following traffic rules. V2's driver also mentioned that he noticed V1 traveling at a high rate of speed and didn't have time to react, further suggesting that V1 was the vehicle at fault. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
