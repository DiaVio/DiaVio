The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason coded for this driver. V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2 (the Honda Accord). This is supported by V1's statement that she wasn't sure what happened when she turned left at the intersection. Additionally, V1's estimated travel and impact speeds were significantly lower (16 kmph or 10 mph) compared to V2's estimated speed (80 kmph or 50 mph). This suggests that V1 may not have accurately judged the speed and distance of the oncoming vehicle, further supporting the conclusion of inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while turning left at the intersection.
