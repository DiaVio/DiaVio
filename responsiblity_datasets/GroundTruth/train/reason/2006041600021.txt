The reason for V1's responsibility is that she cut across three lanes of traffic without properly estimating the time needed to stop. This misjudgment led to her colliding with the back of V2 (1993 Ford Mustang), which then caused V2 to be pushed into V3 (2006 Honda Accord). V1's failure to exercise caution and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of her resulted in the chain reaction collision.
