The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 blacked out while driving, causing the vehicle to depart the roadway and collide with V2. This loss of consciousness was likely due to a seizure caused by the driver's metastasized brain cancer. The driver's foot was on the gas pedal during the crash events, indicating that he was unable to control the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the critical reason was a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act.
