The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1995 Ford Crown Victoria), as reported by a witness who was traveling directly behind V1. V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and collided with the right side of V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to look to his left prior to entering the intersection. Inattention (daydreaming) was also considered an associative factor for V1. Therefore, based on the witness statement and the driver's failure to yield the right of way and adequately surveil the intersection, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
