The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes to the left, crossing three lanes of traffic, and made contact with V2 (the Volkswagen Toureg). This lane change by V1 was the critical pre-crash event, indicating that V1's actions directly led to the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was an unknown driver-related error, suggesting that V1's actions were due to a mistake or error on the part of the driver.
