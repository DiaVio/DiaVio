The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right while negotiating the S curve, indicating a loss of control. V1 then attempted to correct but ended up crossing both lanes and ultimately departing the roadway to the left, where it collided with multiple trees. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
