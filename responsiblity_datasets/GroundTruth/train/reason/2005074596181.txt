The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, crossed the centerline, and struck the left side of V2 (the Peterbilt tractor). This indicates that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and was unable to maintain their lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to always being tired at home and at work, and had sporadic sleeping habits due to asthma. The driver's fatigue and falling asleep at the wheel directly contributed to the accident. It is important for drivers to prioritize their safety and the safety of others on the road by ensuring they are well-rested and alert while driving. In this case, the driver of V1 failed to do so, resulting in the collision.
