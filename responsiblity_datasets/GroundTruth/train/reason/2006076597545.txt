The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while trying to avoid a small animal in the roadway. This overcompensation led to the vehicle rotating and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, the control loss of V1 was influenced by the poor condition of the tires, with zero tread depth and underinflation, which increased the likelihood of the rear end of the vehicle getting away from the driver during quick steering maneuvers.
