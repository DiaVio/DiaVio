The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it veered off the road and entered a grassy median, ultimately impacting the ground. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stayed on the correct path of the off ramp. Additionally, the fact that V1 continued to travel after the initial impact suggests that the driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle in a timely manner.
