The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 reported that he suddenly recognized that V2 was in front of him and attempted to avoid V2 by steering to the left. However, in doing so, the right side of V1 struck the rear corner of V2. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and failed to react in a timely manner to the presence of V2 in front of them, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's failure to maintain control of their vehicle and steer into the eastbound lane caused a collision with Vehicle three (V3), which was traveling in the opposite direction. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt, which may have contributed to the severity of their injuries. However, this does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for the accident.
