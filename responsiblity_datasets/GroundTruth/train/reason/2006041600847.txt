The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a decision error by attempting to complete a left turn with an obstructed view. She stated that her view of lane one was blocked by the line of traffic stopped in lane two, but she proceeded anyway, thinking the coast was clear. This decision error led to her crossing the southbound lanes and being hit by V2. V2 (the driver of the Hyundai) also had a contributing factor, as she encroached over the left lane line from the opposite direction. However, V1's decision error of turning with an obstructed view is the primary cause of the accident.
