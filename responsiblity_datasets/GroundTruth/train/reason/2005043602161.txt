The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. Despite the driver's claim that his view was obstructed by a real estate sign, it was determined by the on-scene inspection that the sign could not have obstructed his view. V1 approached a stop sign, stopped briefly, looked in both directions, and proceeded to cross the intersection. However, he failed to notice V2 approaching from the right side, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately survey the intersection and yield the right of way to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
