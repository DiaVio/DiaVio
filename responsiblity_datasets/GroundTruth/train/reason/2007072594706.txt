The reason for this is that V1 had a defective steering system prior to the crash, as determined by a motor carrier safety inspector. This defective steering system led to a loss of vehicle control, resulting in V1 crossing the lanes and striking the right side of V2. While V2 (the 2006 Chevrolet Malibu) was involved in the crash, the driver of V2 stated that he did not see V1 prior to the collision. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the vehicle-related factor of the defective steering system.
