The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle veering off the road and causing multiple impacts. The driver's fatigue and inexperience, as she had only been licensed for six months, contributed to the accident. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation after waking up further exacerbated the situation. Therefore, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
