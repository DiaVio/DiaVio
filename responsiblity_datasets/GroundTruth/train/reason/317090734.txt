The reason for this is that V2 swerved into the center lane, causing the non-contact vehicle in the center lane to swerve into the right lane, directly in the path of V1. This sudden swerving action by V2 created a dangerous situation and forced V1 to take evasive action by steering sharply to the right and departing the roadway. The actions of V2 directly led to V1 losing control and ultimately crashing into trees, resulting in the serious injuries and fatality of the occupants of V1.
