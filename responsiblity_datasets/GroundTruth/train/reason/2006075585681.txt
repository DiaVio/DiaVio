The reason for this is that V1 made a short left turn in the eastbound lane, which resulted in a head-on collision with V2. The driver of V1 admitted to looking down at her speedometer while turning left, indicating a distraction from the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned feeling uncomfortable driving the Pathfinder, as it was not her primary vehicle. This lack of familiarity with the vehicle's size may have contributed to the driver's difficulty in making the turn safely. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt) was simply traveling eastbound in lane one and did not have any contributing factors mentioned that would make them primarily responsible for the accident.
