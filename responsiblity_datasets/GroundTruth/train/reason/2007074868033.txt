The reason for this is that witnesses confirm that V1 encroached into lane 2 while attempting to make a right-hand turn. This action caused V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Suburban SUV) to collide with the back of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper lane position and control of the vehicle led to the accident.
