The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the red light. Despite noticing the malfunctioning light controls, the driver did not exercise proper caution and failed to see V2 approaching from the north. This inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2.
