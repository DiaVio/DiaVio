The reason for this is that the driver of V2 braked and swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid striking a non-contact vehicle that was slowing and stopping ahead of them to make a left turn. As a result of this evasive action, V2 crossed the center lane lines and entered the westbound lane, ultimately colliding with the front of Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2011 Toyota 4-Runner four-door compact utility vehicle. Therefore, V2's actions of crossing into the opposing lane and causing the collision make it primarily responsible for the accident.
