The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was driving with bald tires, which significantly reduced traction on the wet road. - V1 admitted to knowing the danger of driving with bald tires on a wet roadway but chose to drive anyway. - V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to accelerate up the steep hill, causing the car to rotate counterclockwise and cross the double yellow line into the opposite lane. - V1's loss of control and crossing into the opposite lane resulted in a collision with V2, which was traveling in its own lane. - V1's poor directional control and failure to maintain control of the vehicle with skill ordinarily expected contributed to the accident. In summary, V1's decision to drive with bald tires, failure to control the vehicle, and crossing into the opposite lane led to the collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
