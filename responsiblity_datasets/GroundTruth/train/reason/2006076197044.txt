The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 failed to maintain a safe distance and failed to react in a timely manner to the sudden slowing of the non-contact oil tanker truck. Instead of stopping or maneuvering safely to avoid a collision, the driver of V2 steered into the center median lane where V1 was stopped, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 was distracted by talking on a cell phone, which further contributed to the recognition error and failure to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance, failure to react in a timely manner, and being distracted by a cell phone.
