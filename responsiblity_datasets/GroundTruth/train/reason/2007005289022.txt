The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the actions of Vehicle two (V2). V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, assuming that V2 was going to make a right turn. However, V2 was actually intending to continue straight through the intersection. This false assumption led to V1 turning in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's statement that she saw V2 but thought the truck was going to make a right indicates a failure to properly assess the situation and anticipate the actions of other drivers. This lack of attention and misjudgment contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her false assumption of V2's actions and failure to exercise caution while making the left turn.
