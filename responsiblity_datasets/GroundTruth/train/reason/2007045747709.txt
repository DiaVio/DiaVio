The reason for this is that V2, the Buick Century, was making a left turn across the path of V1, the Buick LeSabre. V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being "inadequate surveillance, failed to look, looked but did not see." V2 also mentioned that she did not know if or when she saw the other vehicle and took no evasive actions before being struck. Additionally, V1's skidmarks indicated lockup, suggesting that V1 attempted to brake and avoid the collision. V1 reported that she saw V2 start to cross her path and braked without lockup, indicating that she made an effort to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
