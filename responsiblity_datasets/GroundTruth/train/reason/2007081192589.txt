The reason for this is that the driver stated that something went wrong with the steering of the vehicle, causing her to lose control. However, the investigation conducted by the officer found that both the steering and brakes were in good working order. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle. Furthermore, the associated factors of underinflated tires, wet roadway conditions, and overcompensation also contribute to the driver's poor directional control. These factors, combined with the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle, ultimately make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
