The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection without having a clear view of lane three (the lane in which V2 was traveling). V1 proceeded into the intersection assuming that all westbound traffic was stopping, but failed to see V2 until just prior to the crash. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet S10 Blazer) stated that he did not see V1 until just before the crash and attempted to brake to avoid the collision. While V2 may have contributed to the accident by not being able to react in time, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for turning with an obstructed view. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to turning left without a clear view of oncoming traffic in lane three.
