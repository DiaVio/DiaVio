The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound and negotiating a left curve while approaching the intersection. V2's front contacted the left side of V1 (the 2010 Chevrolet HHR) as both vehicles entered the intersection. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
