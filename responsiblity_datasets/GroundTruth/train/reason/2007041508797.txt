The reason for this is that V1 made contact with the back of V2 (city transit bus) while V2 was stopped at a red light. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," suggesting that V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicle ahead. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and recognize the stopped vehicle in front makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
