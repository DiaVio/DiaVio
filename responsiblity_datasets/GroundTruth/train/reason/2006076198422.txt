The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, which led to the collision. Despite stopping at the stop sign for a brief period, V1 turned left in front of V2, failing to yield the right of way. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had a suspended license, which further indicates a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic laws. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was traveling within the speed limit and had just down-shifted to slow down for the slower speed limit in the area. The driver of V2 stated that V1 pulled out in front of her, indicating that V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to misjudgment of the gap or other's speed and failure to yield the right of way.
