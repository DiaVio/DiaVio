The driver of V-1 lost control of the vehicle due to hydroplaning on the wet pavement, resulting in the vehicle departing the left side of the road and ultimately overturning onto its left side. The critical reason for the accident was the poor road conditions caused by heavy rain. Additionally, driver inattention, specifically eating and talking to a passenger, was identified as an associated factor.
