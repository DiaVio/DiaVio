The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with following too closely, indicating that they failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them. This is supported by the fact that Vehicle #1 left approximately 10m of pre-impact skids while steering left, indicating that the driver was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as inattention, with associated factors including inadequate surveillance-failure to look far enough ahead and traffic congestion. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not paying enough attention to the road conditions and failed to anticipate the traffic congestion ahead, leading to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and inattention.
