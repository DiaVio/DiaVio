The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the poor road conditions. The slick roadway covered in snow and slush made it difficult for V1 to stop at the stop sign, resulting in the loss of control and entering the intersection. Despite the driver's attempt to stop, the front wheels of the Suburban were locked, indicating excessive speed for the conditions. This failure to adjust the driving speed to match the road conditions ultimately led to the collision with V2. V2 (the 1993 Chrysler LeBaron) took appropriate avoidance actions by applying brake pressure, locking up the wheels, and steering to the right to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the crash.
