The reason for this is that the driver was off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, the driver stated that he was unattentive with an unknown thought focus, which further suggests a lack of focus and control while driving. The driver also mentioned that the tires had a low tread depth of just 2 mm (3/32 of an inch) and mismatched tire pressure, which could have contributed to the loss of control. Overall, the driver's poor directional control, lack of attentiveness, and inadequate tire conditions indicate that he was primarily responsible for the crash.
