V1 was traveling west in lane four and intended to make a left turn at the intersection. However, V1 failed to yield the right-of-way to V2, who was traveling east in lane three and had a green light to proceed straight through the intersection. V1's failure to yield and make a left turn in front of V2 resulted in the collision. Reason: V1 failed to yield the right-of-way to V2, causing the collision.
