The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a right front tire blowout, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. Despite attempting to pump the brakes and steer to the left, the driver was unable to regain control. This resulted in V1 veering across multiple lanes of traffic, colliding with a fence, tree, embankment, and ultimately ending up in a canal. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle after the tire blowout indicates a failure to properly react to the situation, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
