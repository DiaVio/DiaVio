The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop in time before striking the rear of V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier). The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of others. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the stopped vehicles ahead. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the stopped vehicles ahead makes them primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
