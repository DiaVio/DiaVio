The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1 (the Ford Aspire) was traveling straight through the intersection in the westbound lane, and V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. As a result, the front of V1 impacted the right side of V2. It is important to note that V1's critical pre-crash event was "Other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 encroached into V1's lane. V1's driver also stated that V2 made a left turn in front of her and struck her vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection.
