The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reaching for his phone and not seeing V2 before the crash. This internal distraction caused V1 to fail to yield the right-of-way to V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
