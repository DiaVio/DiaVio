The reason for this is that the driver of V1, while attempting to avoid a collision with an unknown vehicle that pulled out in front of her, made a series of maneuvers that resulted in losing control of the vehicle. She initially steered to the left to avoid the unknown vehicle, then sharply steered to the right to reenter the southbound lane, causing the vehicle to yaw to the left and ultimately collide with a utility pole. Additionally, the Event Data Recorder (EDR) data collected from the case vehicle indicates that the speed of travel immediately preceding the crash was much higher than the posted speed limit. This suggests that the driver of V1 was likely driving at an excessive speed, which further contributed to the loss of control and the severity of the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the excessive speed, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
