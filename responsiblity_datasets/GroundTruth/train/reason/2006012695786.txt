The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, as indicated by the Critical Pre-Crash Event and the associated factors coded to this driver. Additionally, the driver had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .19, which is well above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. The driver's impairment due to alcohol consumption likely contributed to their inability to properly negotiate the curve and control the vehicle. Furthermore, the researcher found evidence of a tire and brake deficiency in V1. The bad wear on the outside of the right front tire and the soft brakes could have further compromised the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, impairment from alcohol, and the presence of tire and brake deficiencies.
