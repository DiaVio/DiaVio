The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at his son in the right front passenger seat just before the crash. This distraction caused him to not notice that V2 (2003 Ford F-250 pick-up) had stopped in front of him. As a result, V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of V2.
