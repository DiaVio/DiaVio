The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which were dawn with light fog. This is evident from the Critical Reason for the Critical Event being coded as "traveling too fast for conditions." Additionally, the associated factors coded to this case, such as poor directional control and inadequate/incorrect evasive action, further support the driver's responsibility. By failing to adjust their speed to the prevailing conditions and not being able to maintain control of the vehicle while attempting to avoid the deer, V1's driver ultimately lost control of the car and collided with a tree.
