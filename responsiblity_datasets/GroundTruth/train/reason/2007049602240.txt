The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Saab 9-3) was not primarily responsible for the accident. Although V2 encroached over the left lane line, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle. Additionally, V2 applied the brakes when she saw V1 turning in the intersection, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while turning left at the intersection.
