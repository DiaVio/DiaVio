The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver suffered a seizure, which resulted in V1 traveling off the left side of the roadway and striking the median jersey barrier. The driver's history of epileptic seizures, combined with the fact that he had a seizure during the crash, indicates a physical impairment that affected his ability to act and control the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's poor sleep the night before and feelings of tiredness may have further contributed to his impaired driving ability.
