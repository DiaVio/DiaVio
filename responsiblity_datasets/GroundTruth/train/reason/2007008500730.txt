The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost traction on black ice while negotiating a left curve. Despite being familiar with the road, the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and went off the roadway, ultimately colliding with a utility pole. The driver's speed, although over the speed limit, cannot be accurately determined due to the traction loss. However, under normal conditions, the vehicle would have been able to negotiate the curve. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the same roadway was not icy prior to the crash scene, indicating that the driver may not have adjusted their driving behavior to account for the changed road conditions.
