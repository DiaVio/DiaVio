The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the area before crossing the lanes of traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 because the curve of the road obstructed her view. This indicates a lack of proper observation and failure to ensure that it was safe to proceed. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2000 Ford Ranger) stated that he saw V1 but was unable to avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 had the right-of-way and was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly survey the area and yield the right-of-way makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
