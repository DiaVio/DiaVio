The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle two made a right turn from a parking lot into lane one without adequately surveilling the roadway. The driver misjudged the gap between her vehicle and vehicle one, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of vehicle two was unfamiliar with the roadway and rarely traveled on it, which may have contributed to her misjudgment of the velocity of vehicle one. Therefore, the driver of vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to her inadequate surveillance, misjudgment of the gap, and unfamiliarity with the roadway.
