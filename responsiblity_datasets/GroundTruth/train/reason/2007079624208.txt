The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding through it. The driver of V1 was distracted by focusing on the song on the radio and was also eating oatmeal, which further diverted her attention from the road. Additionally, V1 crossed the intersection with her view obstructed by other vehicles. Although V2 (the driver of the 1995 Nissan Maxima) assumed that V1 would wait until he cleared the intersection, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the intersection and failing to yield the right-of-way to V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and driver-related factors.
