The reason for this is that V1 entered the opposite lane (northbound) and initiated the collision by side-swiping Vehicle 2 (V2) and subsequently impacting Vehicle 3 (V3) head-on. This indicates that V1 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle, resulting in the accident.
