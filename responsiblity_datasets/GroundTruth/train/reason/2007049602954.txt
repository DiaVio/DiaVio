The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was asleep at the wheel, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. The driver had been working a part-time job until 1 hour and 45 minutes before the crash, and had been awake for a total of 21 hours prior to the crash. Additionally, the driver had been drinking alcohol, although no BAC test was conducted. These factors, combined with the driver's fatigue, likely contributed to him falling asleep while driving, resulting in the vehicle traveling off the left side of the road and colliding with the bridge rail.
