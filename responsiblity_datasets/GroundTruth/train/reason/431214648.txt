The reason for this is that V1 attempted to execute a U-turn at a closed crossover and was unable to negotiate it, resulting in V1 traveling off the edge of the crossover and impacting a post with its right side. V1 then entered the eastbound travel lane where it was impacted on the right side by the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). V1's actions of attempting a U-turn at a closed crossover and failing to negotiate it ultimately led to the collision.
