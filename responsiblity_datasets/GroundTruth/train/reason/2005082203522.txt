The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield to V2 as it was approaching the intersection. Despite the presence of parked cars obstructing the view, V1 should have taken the time to carefully observe the intersection before making the left turn. The driver's claim of turning right and not seeing V2 coming is contradicted by the evidence at the scene, which clearly shows V1 turning left. Additionally, the driver's refusal to cooperate with the investigation raises further suspicion of negligence.
