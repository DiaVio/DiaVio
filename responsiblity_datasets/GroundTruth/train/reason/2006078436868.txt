The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking to her left prior to the intersection. This distraction likely caused her to not notice that V2 (the 1994 Ford Ranger) was stopped in front of her. As a result, V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of V2. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 89 kmph, which is above the posted speed limit of 80 kmph. This indicates that both drivers were potentially exceeding the speed limit, but V1's distraction played a significant role in causing the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's external distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the stopped vehicle.
