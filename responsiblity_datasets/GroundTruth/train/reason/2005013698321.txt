The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left-hand turn in front of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Dodge Stratus), which resulted in the collision. V1 admitted to not being familiar with the roadway and misjudged the gap or the speed of V2. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, causing the accident. Although V2 mentioned that V1 did not have their turn signal on, it is important to note that V2's statement does not absolve V1 of responsibility. It is the responsibility of the driver making the turn to ensure that it is safe to do so, regardless of whether the turn signal is used or not. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left-hand turn.
