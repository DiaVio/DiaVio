The driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the roadway as he approached the intersection. His attention was focused on the shopping center to the right, and he lost his train of thought about driving. When he finally returned his attention to the roadway, he was too close to the intersection to stop in time, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and inattention.
