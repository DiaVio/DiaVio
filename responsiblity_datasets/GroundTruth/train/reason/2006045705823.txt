The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash, with a BAC of 0.426. This significantly impairs the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely and maintain control. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control further indicates their inability to safely navigate the road.
