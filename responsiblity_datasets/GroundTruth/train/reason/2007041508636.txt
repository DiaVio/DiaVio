The driver of V1 was found to have made a driver-related decision error by knowingly running the stop sign at the intersection. This illegal maneuver led to the collision with V2 (the Acura 3.0CL). Although the driver of V2 stated that she braked as hard as she could, she was unable to stop her vehicle in time to avoid the collision. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for disregarding the stop sign and causing the accident.
