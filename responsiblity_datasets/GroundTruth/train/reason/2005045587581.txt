The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 attempted to make a left turn across the intersection, misjudging the speed of Vehicle #2 (the Chevrolet S-10 pickup). Vehicle #1 stated that they only came to a rolling stop before attempting the left turn, indicating a failure to yield to oncoming traffic. Additionally, Vehicle #1 reacted by slamming on the brakes when Vehicle #2 honked its horn, instead of accelerating across the intersection. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to yield and misjudgment of the oncoming vehicle's speed led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
