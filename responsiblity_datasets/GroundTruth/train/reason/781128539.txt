The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle when it traveled through a standing puddle of water, causing the drive wheels to lose contact with the roadway surface. The driver's attempt to regain control by steering right resulted in the vehicle mounting the embankment and colliding with an exit sign post. The impact and further driver input caused the vehicle to overturn and come to rest on its top in the roadway. Therefore, the driver's actions and loss of control of the vehicle led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
