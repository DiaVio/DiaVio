The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that his foot became stuck between the gas and brake pedals, leading to a performance error. This indicates that the driver was unable to properly control the vehicle, resulting in V1 going off the traffic way, striking a fence, and ultimately hitting a tree. The driver's age, vision and hearing problems, as well as his heart condition and medication, may have also contributed to his inability to react appropriately in the situation.
