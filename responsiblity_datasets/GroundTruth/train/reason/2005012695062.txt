The driver of V1 failed to stop at a red light, which is a violation of traffic laws. This decision error, along with the driver's admission of seeing the red light in advance but thinking he was going too fast to stop, indicates negligence on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inattentive to the driving task, which further contributed to the accident. The driver's excessive speed, conversation with a passenger, and aggressive driving behavior were also associated factors that contributed to the crash.
