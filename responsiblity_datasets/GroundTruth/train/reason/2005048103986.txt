The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was lost and distracted while conversing on the phone, which likely contributed to their departure from the right side of the road. Additionally, the driver had been drinking and taking medication, which may have impaired their judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. The police reported travel speed of 40 kmph for V1 suggests that they were likely traveling at a speed higher than the posted speed limit of 48 kph (30 mph), which could have also contributed to the crash.
