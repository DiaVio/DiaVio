The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was making a left turn from a private drive onto the arterial road, and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 (1996 Plymouth Voyager) which was traveling west on the arterial road. Vehicle #1 misjudged the gap in traffic and pulled out in front of Vehicle #2, causing the collision. Additionally, Vehicle #1's view of oncoming westbound traffic was partially obstructed by a non-contact vehicle turning into the same driveway. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was driving on the arterial road and had the right of way. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that Vehicle #1 pulled out in front of her from the right, and she had to brake hard and slid into Vehicle #1. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn.
