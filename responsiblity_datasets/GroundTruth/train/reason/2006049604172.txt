The reason for this is that V1 lost control on the wet roadway, started to rotate counter clockwise, and ultimately departed the road and rolled over. The worn concrete travel lanes, wet and slick roads from the light rain, and the low tread depth on the front tires and lower inflation on the rear tires of V1 may have contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the fact that both occupants were ejected from the vehicle suggests that they were not properly restrained, which is the responsibility of the driver.
