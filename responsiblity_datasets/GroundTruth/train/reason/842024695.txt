The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right pavement edge of the road, struck a rock, and then impacted a concrete culvert. This sequence of events caused the vehicle to rotate sharply clockwise and initiate a left side rollover. The rollover resulted in damage to the vehicle and caused injuries to the occupants, including the restrained 9-year-old female rear center child passenger and the restrained 13-year-old male rear right child passenger. Therefore, Vehicle 1's actions of leaving the road, striking the rock, and impacting the culvert ultimately led to the accident and the resulting injuries.
