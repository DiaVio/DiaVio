The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately survey the oncoming traffic before making the turn. This is evident from the fact that V1 slowed down to allow opposite traveling traffic to clear, but failed to notice V2 approaching in the westbound #3 lane. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look or see V2 resulted in the collision.
