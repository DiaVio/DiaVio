The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the rear of Vehicle 1 while it was stopped to make a left-hand turn. The driver of Vehicle 2 reportedly braked prior to the impact but skidded into the back of Vehicle 1. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was that another motor vehicle in the lane was stopped, and the critical reason for this event was an unknown type of driver error. Additionally, factors such as wet roads, misjudgment of velocity and gap to the forward vehicle, and insufficient braking inputs were coded to Vehicle 2. These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and did not take appropriate measures to avoid the collision. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's error and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
