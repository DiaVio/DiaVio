The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 struck the back of V2 (the Landrover LR3) while V2 was stopped to make a left-hand turn. V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not see any turn signal or brake lights on V2, indicating a lack of attention and possible misjudgment of the other vehicle's velocity. This suggests that V1's driver may have been inattentive and failed to anticipate the actions of the vehicle in front, leading to the collision.
