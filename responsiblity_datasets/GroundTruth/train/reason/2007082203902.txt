The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver of V1 was engaged in an unsafe maneuver by making a u-turn from a parked position without adequately surveilling the roadway. The driver of V1 failed to look or failed to see the approaching V2 (the Hyundai Accent), resulting in the left side of V1 impacting the front right corner of V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while making a u-turn make them primarily responsible for the accident.
