The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling too fast for the conditions and made an incorrect evasive action. Despite knowing that vehicles in lane 2 wanted to enter their lane, V1 did not reduce their speed and instead maintained or increased it. This lack of caution and failure to adjust their speed accordingly contributed to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1998 Plymouth Voyager minivan) also bears some responsibility for illegally stopping in the right shoulder lane where parking was not permitted. However, V1's failure to reduce speed and their incorrect evasive action are the primary factors that led to the accident.
