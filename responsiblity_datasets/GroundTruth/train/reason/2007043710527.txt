The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 admitted to looking ahead before proceeding, but failed to see V2 until it was too late. Additionally, V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway and was feeling lost and confused. These factors contributed to V1's failure to properly observe and anticipate the presence of V2, resulting in the collision.
