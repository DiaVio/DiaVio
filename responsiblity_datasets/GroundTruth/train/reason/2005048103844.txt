The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for the stop sign and entered the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. The driver was distracted by a conversation with his passenger and failed to look for oncoming traffic, including V2. This failure to exercise proper surveillance and disregard for the stop sign led to the collision with V2.
