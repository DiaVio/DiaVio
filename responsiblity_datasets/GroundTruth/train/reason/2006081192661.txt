The reason for this is that V1 was making an illegal maneuver by turning right from the center left turn lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the area before making the turn, as evidenced by the fact that she did not see any traffic approaching in the first lane where V2 was traveling. This lack of proper surveillance and failure to adhere to traffic laws ultimately led to the collision between V1 and V2.
