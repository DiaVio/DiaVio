The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see V1 approaching. This failure to properly observe the intersection and oncoming traffic led to V2 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V1.
