The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway and struck a large tree with its right front plane. It then rebounded off another tree with its frontal plane at a slight left side leading angle/yaw. These actions indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the collision with the trees.
