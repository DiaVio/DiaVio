The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while trying to negotiate the curve on the icy road. The driver stated that he drifted into the oncoming lane and then attempted to steer back to the right, but he turned the wheel too much and accelerated too much, causing the vehicle to skid laterally and ultimately roll onto its left side. The driver's overcompensation and failure to maintain control of the vehicle in poor road conditions led to the crash.
