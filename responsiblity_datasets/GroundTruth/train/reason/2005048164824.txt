The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway multiple times, indicating a lack of control and poor directional control. The witness also stated that V1 had to steer to the right to avoid another vehicle, suggesting that V1 was not able to navigate the curve properly. The critical reason for the crash was determined to be the driver-related factor of driving too fast for the curve/turn, which led to overcompensation and ultimately the collision with the tree.
