The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to the unexpected actions of the vehicle in front (V2). V1 attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and veering left, but was unable to do so successfully, resulting in the impact with V2. Therefore, V1's driver-related decision error of following too closely and being unable to respond to unexpected actions is the primary reason for the collision.
