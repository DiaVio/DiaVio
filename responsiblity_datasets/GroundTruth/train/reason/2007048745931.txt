The reason for this is that the driver of V1 swerved left to avoid a raccoon in the roadway, which caused the vehicle to travel off the left side of the roadway and ultimately roll over. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; overcompensation." This suggests that the driver of V1 overcorrected after the initial avoidance maneuvers, leading to a loss of control. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had only been driving for four months and it was her first time on this road. This lack of experience could have contributed to her inability to effectively handle the situation and regain control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation and inexperience.
