The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions (puddle) and insufficient evasive actions. V1's right side tires contacted standing water, causing the vehicle to cross the centerline and enter the westbound lane while rotating clockwise. This resulted in V1 facing south-southwest in the westbound lane. V2 (the 2006 Chevrolet Malibu) was unable to avoid the collision and struck the rear of V1. While V2's driver also had some contributing factors, such as the wet road conditions and possible fatigue after exercising, V1's actions of hitting the puddle and losing control of the vehicle were the primary cause of the accident.
