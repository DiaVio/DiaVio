The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the roadway to the right, impacting a curb and then a building. Additionally, the witness stated that the driver of V1 was racing another vehicle, which passed her on the left at a high rate of speed. Although the driver of V1 fled the scene and could not be interviewed, the witness's account suggests that V1 was engaged in reckless driving behavior, which likely contributed to the crash.
