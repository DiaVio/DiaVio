The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the road while negotiating a left curve, crossed the center line, and then departed the left side of the road. It subsequently collided with various objects, including a rock-filled culvert, a plastic utility marker, a street sign, an embankment, a yard ornament, and a wooden mailbox post. The sequence of events suggests that Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain control and stay on the road, leading to the multiple off-road impacts.
