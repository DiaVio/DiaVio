The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not watching the vehicle in front of him. He looked down to shift and when he looked back up, V2 (the Buick Century) was already stopped. Despite attempting to apply the brakes, V1 was unable to avoid colliding with V2. Reason: V1 is primarily responsible due to the driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
