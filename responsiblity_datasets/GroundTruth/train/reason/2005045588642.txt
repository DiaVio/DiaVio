The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 (the 1991 Ford Escort) while making a left turn onto the four-lane arterial road. Despite the view being partially blocked by a non-contact tractor-trailer, the driver of Vehicle #1 proceeded with the left turn without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. This action resulted in the front of Vehicle #1 colliding with the right side of Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with failure to yield by the police. The driver's statement that he did not see any other vehicles approaching indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the traffic situation. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield and inadequate observation while making the left turn.
