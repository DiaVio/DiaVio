The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a sudden and unexplained maneuver, attempting to steer back to the right after appearing to make a left turn without activating the turn signal. This sudden change in direction caused V1 to accelerate and collide with the southwest curb of an intersection, leading to a series of subsequent impacts and damage to property and parked vehicles. Additionally, the witness accounts indicate that the driver of V1 did not attempt to brake, steer, or return to the roadway during the entire incident, suggesting a lack of control over the vehicle. The driver's own statement of panicking and not attempting to take control further supports the conclusion that V1's driver was responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
