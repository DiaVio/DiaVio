The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was making a left turn across the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), which had the right of way. V1 was approaching a stop sign and failed to yield to the oncoming traffic in the southbound lane where V2 was traveling. This failure to yield resulted in the front of V1 impacting the front of V2, causing the crash.
