The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which resulted in the vehicle veering off the roadway, striking the center median, and ultimately ending up in a shallow stream. The driver's decision error of traveling at an excessive speed for the turn led to the loss of control of the vehicle.
