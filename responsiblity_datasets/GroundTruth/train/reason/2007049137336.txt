The reason for this determination is that V1 departed the lane on the right side, crossed through multiple lanes, and ultimately left the roadway on the right side. The vehicle then collided with a wooden road work sign, a pole, and a guy wire. The fact that the driver of V1 left the scene, was not identified, and could not be interviewed further supports the conclusion that V1 is responsible for the crash.
