The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted off the right side of the roadway, sideswiped the north guardrail, and then crossed all three westbound lanes before striking the south concrete wall of the bridge. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the collision with the bridge wall.
