The driver of V1 noticed an animal in the roadway ahead and attempted to avoid it by steering right and then left. However, the driver overcorrected, causing V1 to go into a counterclockwise rotation and ultimately veer off the roadway and roll over. The primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 because they failed to maintain control of the vehicle after attempting to avoid the animal. Additionally, the driver was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of their injuries.
