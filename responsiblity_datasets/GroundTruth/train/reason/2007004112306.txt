The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign before making a left turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that he slowed down but never completely stopped because he thought the road looked clear. Additionally, the driver admitted to not properly defrosting the windows, which obstructed his view and contributed to the crash. If the driver of V1 had completed the turn, the collision could have been avoided. V2 (the Ford Aerostar minivan) attempted to avoid the collision by steering and braking but was unsuccessful. Therefore, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's failure to stop, making V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
