The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 suddenly veered off the roadway to the right, indicating a possible mechanical problem with the front right wheel. The witness also confirmed that Vehicle #1 was not speeding. Therefore, it can be inferred that the mechanical failure of Vehicle #1 caused it to lose control and crash into the utility pole and guide wire.
