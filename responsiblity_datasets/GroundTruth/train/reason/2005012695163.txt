The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted by picking up his cell phone and dialing at the time of the crash, which was identified as a recognition error and an internal distraction. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to having only 2.5 hours of sleep in the last 24 hours, indicating possible fatigue. These factors contributed to the driver's failure to recognize the slowed vehicles ahead and resulted in the rear-end collision with Vehicle #2 (1996 Ford Escort), which then pushed Vehicle #2 into Vehicle #3 (2001 Pontiac Bonneville).
