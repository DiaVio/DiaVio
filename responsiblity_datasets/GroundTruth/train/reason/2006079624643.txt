The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by external factors, specifically engaging in conversation with passengers about a basketball game and music playing on the radio. Additionally, the driver was not wearing his contact lenses, which may have impaired his vision. These distractions caused the driver of V1 to not pay sufficient attention to the road ahead and the actions of other vehicles, resulting in him failing to notice that V2 was decelerating in front of him. V2 (the 1997 Acura 2.2 CL) cannot be attributed with primary responsibility as the driver of V2 was following the normal flow of traffic and was unable to take any evasive action to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the deceleration of V2.
