The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. This is a clear violation of traffic rules and regulations. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the stop sign, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving. Although V2 had a sightline restriction due to a tree and shrubbery, it is the responsibility of all drivers to ensure that they have a clear view of the intersection before proceeding. V2 stopped at the intersection, looked in all directions, and then began to move forward. The driver of V2 did everything correctly and could not have reasonably anticipated the failure of V1 to stop at the stop sign. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and their lack of attention while driving.
