The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was engaging in aggressive driving behavior, attempting to elude the police while speeding and changing lanes dangerously. This behavior ultimately led to V1 veering off the roadway, hitting a parked truck (V2), and pinning a pedestrian. Additionally, after the driver of V1 abandoned the vehicle, it rolled into the roadway and collided with another vehicle (V3) that was stopped at a red light. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's aggressive driving and attempts to evade the police.
