The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the distance and speed of V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet GEO Metro) while attempting to make a U-turn. This indicates a driver-related factor, specifically a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to accurately assess the situation and make a safe U-turn resulted in the collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
