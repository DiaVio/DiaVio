The driver of V1 made several errors that contributed to the crash. Firstly, the driver was driving too fast for the icy and rutted conditions of the roadway. This decision error shows a lack of judgment and awareness of the road conditions. Additionally, the driver's choice to steer right after the car was pulled to the left by the ruts indicates an inappropriate evasive action. This sudden steering maneuver likely caused the loss of control and subsequent clockwise yaw. Furthermore, the driver's overcorrection after losing control further exacerbated the situation, leading to V1 exiting the roadway and rolling over. While there were contributing factors such as the icy and rutted condition of the roadway and the over-inflated tires, it is ultimately the driver's responsibility to adjust their driving behavior to match the road conditions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error of driving too fast for the conditions, inappropriate evasive action, and overcorrection.
