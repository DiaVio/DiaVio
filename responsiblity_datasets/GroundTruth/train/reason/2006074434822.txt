The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One was distracted internally, specifically by reaching for a cell phone that had slid off the console onto the floor. This distraction caused the driver to drive off the right side of the road and collide with a utility pole. Additionally, the driver's lack of sleep (only three and a half hours) and being on medication (Prozac) may have contributed to their impaired judgment and reaction time. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's internal distraction and potential fatigue and medication-related impairment.
