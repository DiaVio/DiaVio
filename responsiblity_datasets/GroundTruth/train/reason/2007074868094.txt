The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 changed lanes into the oncoming southbound travel lane to pass V2 and make a left turn at the intersection. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with the consumption of illegal drugs (crack cocaine), contributed to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2001 Chevy Cavalier sedan) was coded with the critical pre-crash event of other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane over the left lane line. However, the critical reason was not coded to V2, indicating that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their aggressive driving behavior and lane change into oncoming traffic.
