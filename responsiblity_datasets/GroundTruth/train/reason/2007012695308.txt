The reason for this is that V2 changed lanes to the left to pass V1 in the left-turn lane, without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1, unaware of V2's presence, also changed lanes to the left to make a left-hand turn. As a result, the front of V2 contacted the left side of V1, causing V1 to depart the roadway and impact a curb, while V2 came to rest in the roadway and caught fire. V2's failure to properly assess the situation and make a safe lane change, combined with the false assumption that V1 would yield, led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 being in a hurry and the adverse weather conditions (snow) were contributing factors. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
