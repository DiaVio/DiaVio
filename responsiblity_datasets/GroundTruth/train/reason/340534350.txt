The reason for this is that V1 was crossing through the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2, the 2011 Toyota Camry, which was already in the northbound through lane. V1's failure to yield resulted in the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, the impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and strike the front of V3, the 2000 Kenworth T-600 tractor/trailer unit. This secondary collision was a direct result of V1's initial failure to yield to V2. Therefore, V1's actions of crossing the intersection without yielding and causing subsequent collisions make it primarily responsible for the accident.
