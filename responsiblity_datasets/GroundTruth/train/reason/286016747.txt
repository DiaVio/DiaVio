The reason for this is that V1, a 2005 BMW 325i 4door sedan, lost control while attempting to negotiate a left-hand curve at the hill crest. V1 exited the roadway and traveled on the grass shoulder before impacting a tree on the right side. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
