The reason for V-1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to drift into the westbound lane and eventually off the left side of the roadway. This resulted in the vehicle striking a wooden power pole. The driver's statement confirms that he closed his eyes for a moment and woke up to find himself off the roadway with the power pole directly in front of him. The driver's drowsiness and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle are the main factors contributing to the crash.
