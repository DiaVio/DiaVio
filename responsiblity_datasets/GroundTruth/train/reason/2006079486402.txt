The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make an improper left turn by first turning right and then attempting to make a U-turn behind the stopped southbound turn lane. This action violated the proper procedure for making a left turn and resulted in V1 crossing the third lane and colliding with V2 (the Nissan Pathfinder) traveling in that lane. Additionally, V1 reported that she did not see V2 prior to making the turn, indicating inadequate surveillance and a recognition error on the part of V1. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the collision. In contrast, V2 was traveling in the third lane, passing the private drive on its right, and had the right of way. The driver of V2 saw V1 execute a right turn and assumed that was V1's intention. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by activating the brakes and steering left, but was unable to do so in time. Overall, V1's improper left turn, inadequate surveillance, and recognition error make her primarily responsible for the collision.
