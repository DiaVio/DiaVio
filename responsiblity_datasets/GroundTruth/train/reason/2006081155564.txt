The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead. It was reported that the driver of V1 was looking in his rearview mirror instead of forward, which indicates a lack of focus on the immediate surroundings. Additionally, V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of forward traffic, suggesting a failure to maintain a safe following distance. V2 (the driver of the Chevy 6500 Box Truck) was initially traveling in the same direction as V1 but was in the process of making a right turn onto a private driveway. While V2 may have been traveling at a higher speed, the critical reason for the accident was attributed to V1's driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and following too closely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their distracted driving and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
