The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection on the yellow phase of the signal light and accelerated through the intersection, assuming that V1 (the 1989 GMC G-2500 cargo van) would remain stopped and allow her to pass. However, V1 started its turn and the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V2's false assumption of V1's actions and failure to yield the right of way resulted in the collision.
