The reason for this is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle veering off the road on the right side. The witness also reported seeing V1 move to the left, possibly indicating an attempt to pass, before abruptly cutting back to the right and leaving the roadway. This erratic behavior suggests a lack of control and awareness on the part of the driver, further supporting their responsibility for the accident. Additionally, the critical reason coded to the driver was "a driver related critical non-performance error of sleeping/actually asleep," and the contributing factor was "fatigue." These factors clearly indicate that the driver's drowsiness and subsequent sleep at the wheel were the primary causes of the crash.
