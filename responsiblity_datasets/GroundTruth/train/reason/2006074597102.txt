The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two, a sixteen-year-old female, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making her right turn. She was distracted by a conversation with her mother and did not look to the left before proceeding to turn right. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic from the left resulted in the collision with Vehicle one. While Vehicle one was traveling slightly above the speed limit on the four-lane road, it was the responsibility of Vehicle two to ensure that it was safe to make the right turn. Therefore, Vehicle two's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
