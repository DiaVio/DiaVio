The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a work-related conversation with his passengers, thinking about the meeting, and looking at his turn destination. This inattention and failure to see V2 approaching from the opposite direction led to the collision. While V2 (the driver of the 1994 Honda Accord) was also found to have inadequate surveillance, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to their vehicle. Therefore, V2's responsibility is secondary to V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and distraction, while V2's responsibility is secondary.
