The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver recognized that his speed was too great for the curve he was entering and attempted to brake and steer to the right. However, V1 still ended up departing the left side of the road, resulting in a collision with a tree stump and subsequent rollover. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and adjust their speed appropriately for the road conditions.
