The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver became fatigued and allowed the vehicle to drift off the right roadside. Although the driver attempted to steer the vehicle back onto the roadway, the vehicle's back end slid out to the left, causing it to enter into a clockwise yaw and ultimately overturn. The driver's fatigue and failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the accident.
