The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the intersection, and V2, the 1994 Buick Century, four-door sedan, was traveling straight through the intersection. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, causing the collision. Additionally, V1's front plane was angled towards the front of V2, indicating that V1 was not properly positioned to make the left turn safely.
