The reason for V1's responsibility is that the vehicle left the roadway on the right side, indicating a failure to maintain proper control and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, the vehicle overcompensated when returning to the roadway, causing it to enter oncoming traffic and ultimately collide with a tree and a fence. It is important to note that the driver of V1 suffered severe injuries, and it is unknown if any fatigue or health-related issues contributed to the crash. However, regardless of any potential contributing factors, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for the actions leading up to the crash.
