The driver of V1 was driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, specifically not expecting the forward vehicle (V2) to stop. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was thinking about his vacation that just ended, which suggests a lack of focus and attention on the road. Inattention and inadequate surveillance were also identified as associative factors for this driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driving too fast, not maintaining a safe following distance, and being distracted while driving.
