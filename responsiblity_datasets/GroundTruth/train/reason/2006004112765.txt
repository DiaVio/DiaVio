The reason for this is that V2 failed to properly assess the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to not looking well enough and being focused on beating the amber light. Additionally, the driver was speeding, ignored the traffic control device, and was driving aggressively. These factors indicate a lack of caution and disregard for the safety of others on the road.
