The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the area before changing lanes. The driver stated that he checked his mirrors on the right but did not see the pickup truck (V2) approaching in the second lane. This indicates a failure to properly observe the surrounding traffic before making a lane change. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to his lack of awareness of the pickup truck's presence. However, being unfamiliar with the road does not absolve the driver of the responsibility to ensure a safe lane change. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to observe the approaching vehicle in the adjacent lane.
