The reason for this is that V3 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding straight across. V3 assumed the intersection was clear because the vehicles ahead of her had proceeded, but she did not look in the direction of V1 and therefore did not see it. This lack of surveillance led to the collision with V1.
