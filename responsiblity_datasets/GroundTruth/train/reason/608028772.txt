The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to recognize the non-contact vehicle ahead of her slowing down to enter the pull-through. Instead of braking or steering to avoid a collision, the driver mistakenly applied the accelerator, causing the vehicle to traverse the pull-through, cross the eastbound lanes, and ultimately leave the road. This indicates a lack of attention and control on the part of the driver, leading to the accident.
