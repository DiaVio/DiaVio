The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver's performance error of overcompensation. The driver stated that she noticed her vehicle drifting into the right lane and attempted to steer left to get back into her lane. However, in an attempt to avoid hitting the barrier wall, she overcorrected by steering right, causing the vehicle to cross two lanes of traffic and ultimately roll over before coming to a rest. This overcompensation by the driver indicates a mistake in judgment and control of the vehicle, leading to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
