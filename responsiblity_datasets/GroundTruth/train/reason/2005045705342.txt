The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 struck Vehicle #2 from behind while it was stopped at a red light. The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he saw Vehicle #2 already stopped at the light and attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the crash, but was unable to do so. The driver of Vehicle #1 also mentioned that the road was wet and he had a significant amount of cargo in his vehicle, which may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error of driving too fast for the rainy conditions and failing to stop in time to avoid a collision with the stopped Vehicle #2.
