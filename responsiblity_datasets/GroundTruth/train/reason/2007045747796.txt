The reason for this is that V1 crossed the center double yellow lane marker into the path of V2 (the Ford Escort), causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 provided false information about the crash, claiming that the impact was on his side of the road when evidence at the scene proved otherwise. Witnesses also reported seeing the occupants of V1 attempting to dispose of drugs after the crash, suggesting possible impairment. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was at fault for the collision.
