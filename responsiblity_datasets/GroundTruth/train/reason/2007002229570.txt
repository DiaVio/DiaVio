The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to falling asleep and not remembering the crash. This indicates that the driver was not alert and failed to maintain control of their vehicle. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane, Traveling in same Direction while Decelerating," suggesting that Vehicle #1 was not able to react in time to the deceleration of Vehicle #2. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was traveling at a higher speed, but the driver stated that they had been watching Vehicle #1 closely and believed that the driver had fallen asleep. This suggests that Vehicle #2 was not the primary cause of the crash.
