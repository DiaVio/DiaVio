The reason for this is that the driver of V1 suffered a stroke prior to the crash, which impaired their ability to act and control the vehicle. The driver of V1 did not take any evasive actions to avoid V2, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle. Additionally, witness accounts confirm that V1 was traveling erratically just before crossing the centerline, further supporting the conclusion that V1 was at fault.
