The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions, specifically the presence of snow and ice. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical event being coded as "too fast for conditions (snow & ice)" and the fact that both rear tires had a minimum tread of 1/32 and 2/32 inches. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and subsequent slide and loss of control resulted in the collision with the tree and the rotation of the vehicle.
