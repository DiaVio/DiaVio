The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, but V2's impact on the left side of V1 suggests that V2 did not properly observe or yield to oncoming traffic.
