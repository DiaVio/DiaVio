The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which is a driver-related error. This resulted in V1 rear-ending V2 (the Toyota four door) while it was stopped at a red light. The fact that V1 went on to collide with V3 (the Jeep Liberty) and eventually came to rest on an iron fence further supports the conclusion that V1's driver was not in control of the vehicle due to falling asleep.
