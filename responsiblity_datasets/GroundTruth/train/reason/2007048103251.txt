The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that he started to change lanes to the right and saw a vehicle in lane one. In response to this, he overcompensated by steering left, which caused V1 to travel off the road on the left side. The driver then jerked the vehicle back to the right, resulting in fishtailing and ultimately causing V1 to roll over and strike a tree. Therefore, V1's driver's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control led to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
