The reason for this is that V2 made a lane change in front of V1 and then abruptly hit the brakes, causing V1 to collide with the back of V2. V2's actions of changing lanes without sufficient warning or indication, and then braking suddenly, created an unsafe situation and contributed to the collision. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V2 left the scene of the crash further suggests their responsibility in the accident.
