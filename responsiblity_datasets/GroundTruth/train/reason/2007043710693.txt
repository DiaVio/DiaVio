The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by listening to the radio and her friend's telephone conversation, which drew her attention away from her driving task. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions and did not realize that caution was needed. The driver's lack of familiarity with the traffic flow in the area and the over-inflated front tires of V1 were contributing factors. The presence of cars stopped in front of V2, which caused V2 to slow down and stop, was also a contributing factor. However, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance ultimately led to the rear-end collision.
