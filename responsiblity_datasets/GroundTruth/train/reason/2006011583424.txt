The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that the rear of the vehicle started to slide to the left, indicating a loss of control. The driver's attempts to regain control by steering left, right, and then left again were unsuccessful, resulting in V1 rotating 180 degrees counterclockwise and ultimately colliding with the inside guardrail. Additionally, the vehicle inspection revealed that the rear tires of V1 were extremely worn, with minimal tread remaining. This condition may have contributed to the loss of control on the wet roadway. Therefore, the driver's poor directional control and the worn rear tires of V1 are the primary factors that led to the crash.
