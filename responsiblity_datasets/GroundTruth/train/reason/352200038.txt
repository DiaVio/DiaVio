The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the left, southbound travel lane and entered the intersection at the same time as Vehicle 2, which was stopped in the eastbound lane. Despite attempting to brake, the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to avoid the collision, resulting in the frontal impact with Vehicle 2. Therefore, Vehicle 1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
