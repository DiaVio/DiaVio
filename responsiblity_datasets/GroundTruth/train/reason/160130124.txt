The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, which would require yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, the 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV, was traveling straight in its lane and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and make a safe left turn resulted in the collision with V2.
