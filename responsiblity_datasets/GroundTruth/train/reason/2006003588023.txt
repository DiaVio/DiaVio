The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and impacted the back of V2 (the 1989 Toyota Camry) which was legally parked with no occupants present. The driver of V1 stated that an unknown white van traveling northbound made a turn in front of her, causing her to lose control and impact V2. However, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. The critical reason for this event was coded as an unknown reason, but one associated factor coded to V1 was a false assumption, assuming that the other driver would yield right-of-way. Since V1 was the vehicle that lost control and caused the initial impact with V2, it is primarily responsible for the accident. The driver's false assumption and failure to maintain control of the vehicle contributed to the collision.
