The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with DUI, open container, a roadway lane violation, and no proof of insurance. He was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .18, tested positive for cocaine and cannabinoids, and was fatigued at the time of the crash. The driver and his passenger were arguing, which likely contributed to his distraction and erratic driving behavior. Vehicle #2 (1996 Nissan Sentra) was operated by a 50-year-old female who was following the traffic rules and was not found to have any contributing factors that could have caused the crash. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired state, distracted driving, and violation of traffic laws.
