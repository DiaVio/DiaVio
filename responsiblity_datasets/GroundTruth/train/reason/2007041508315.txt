The reason for this is that V2 failed to look both ways before entering the intersection, which is a recognition-related error. This failure to properly assess the situation and identify the presence of V1 (the Dodge Ramcharger) resulted in V2 pulling out into the intersection without seeing the other vehicle. As a result, V1 and V2 collided, causing damage to both vehicles and resulting in V2 veering off the roadway and hitting a chain link fence. Therefore, V2's failure to exercise proper caution and yield the right of way to V1 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
