The reason for this is that V1 was traveling south in lane one with the intention to continue through the intersection. V1 had its lights and sirens activated as it approached the intersection, indicating that it was responding to an emergency call. However, V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 2005 Ford Explorer Police vehicle) which was also responding to a call and traveling east in lane one. V1 struck the left side of V2, causing it to rotate clockwise and come to a rest in the northbound lane. V1 continued forward slightly before coming to a final rest in the same lane of travel. Although limited information was obtained from the PAR and no interview could be obtained from the driver of V1, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a decision error, specifically a fire vehicle on an emergency run. This suggests that the driver of V1 made an error in judgment or decision-making, possibly due to the sightline restriction posed by the surrounding buildings. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
