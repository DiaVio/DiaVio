The reason for this is that V1 was fleeing from the police at a high rate of speed, indicating aggressive driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of V1 had no training and little experience on motorcycles, which suggests a lack of skill and knowledge in handling the vehicle. On the other hand, V2 (the Pontiac Grand Am) was traveling in a normal manner and the driver was not at fault for the crash. The driver of V2 stated that she did not see V1 prior to the crash, indicating that V1's actions were unexpected and not easily avoidable. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior and lack of experience make them primarily responsible for the crash.
