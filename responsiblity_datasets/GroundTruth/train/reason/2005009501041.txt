The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling at a high rate of speed and was unable to stop before making contact with the rear of V2 (the 2000 Mitsubishi Galant). This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the stopped vehicles ahead. Additionally, V2's Critical Precrash Event is listed as "the other motor vehicle in the same lane traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 was impacted by the force of V1's collision, further indicating V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the driver of V1 refused to be interviewed, so the exact reason for their high rate of speed and inability to stop is unknown. However, based on the available information, V1's actions and failure to maintain a safe following distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
