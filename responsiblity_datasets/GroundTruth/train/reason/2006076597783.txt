The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, the driver did not realize the depth of the standing water on the roadway, which caused the vehicle to lose control and ultimately crash into the irrigation ditch. The driver's lack of experience, having only been driving for two months, may have also contributed to the inability to handle the situation appropriately.
