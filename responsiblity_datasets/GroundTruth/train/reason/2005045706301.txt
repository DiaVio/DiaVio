The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the double yellow line into the first northbound lane near the apex of the curve, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2. The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that he possibly blacked out and had a heart attack or other physical impairment that affected his ability to act. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was fatigued, ill, and on several medications for diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not in a condition to safely operate the vehicle, leading to the crossing of the double yellow line and the subsequent crash.
