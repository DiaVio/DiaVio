The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption of the other driver's actions. After realizing that he had encroached into V2's travel lane, the driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 would take avoidance actions to avoid the collision. This assumption led to V1 not taking immediate action to back up into the center turn lane, even though he had sufficient time to do so. Additionally, the sight line for V2 was partially blocked by a large panel truck in front of him, which may have contributed to the driver of V2 not being able to see V1 in time to avoid the collision. While there are some possible associative factors for V2, such as unfamiliarity with the road and low tread on the front tires, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's false assumption and failure to take appropriate action.
