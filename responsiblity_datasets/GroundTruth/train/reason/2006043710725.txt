The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at an ice cream shop and not paying attention to the roadway. This external distraction caused the driver to fail to notice that V2 had stopped for the red light. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported attempting to brake but was unable to stop in time, indicating a failure to maintain a safe following distance. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
