The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2, which was going straight. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn, as indicated by the driver's admission of looking but not seeing V2 approaching. V1 did not take any avoidance actions before the collision. On the other hand, V2 was traveling within their lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 reported that they did not see V1 and took no evasive action before the impact. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
