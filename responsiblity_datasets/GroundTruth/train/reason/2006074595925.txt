The reason for this is that V1 admitted to driving above the speed limit, failing to realize that the traffic signal was red, and not being comfortable with the vehicle's brakes or engine. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for inadequate surveillance, indicating that they failed to properly observe the intersection before proceeding. These factors, including the driver's inattention, speed, failure to stop for the red signal, and the sightline restriction caused by the trees and shrubs, all contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
