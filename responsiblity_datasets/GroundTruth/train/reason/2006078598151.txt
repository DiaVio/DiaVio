The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, crossing the path of V2. This action directly caused the collision between V1 and V2, which then led to the subsequent collisions with V3 and V4. The driver of V1 admitted to running the stop sign and stated that they never saw V2 until the collision occurred. This indicates a clear violation of traffic laws and a failure to exercise proper caution at the intersection.
