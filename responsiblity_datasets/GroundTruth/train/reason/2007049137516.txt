The driver of V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the Chevrolet Malibu). This failure to properly observe the oncoming vehicle resulted in V1 colliding with the left side of V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic is the reason for the crash.
