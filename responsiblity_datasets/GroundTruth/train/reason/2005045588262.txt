The driver of Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left onto the arterial road and was struck by the front of Vehicle #2 (1998 Ford Escort). The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that she stopped and looked both ways twice before attempting to turn left, but her view was obstructed by parked vehicles on the side of the road. The scene inspection confirmed that the parked vehicles did obstruct the view. The police charged the driver of Vehicle #1 with failure to yield, indicating that she did not give the right of way to oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the critical event involving Vehicle #1 was a recognition error and inadequate surveillance. The driver's view was obstructed, and she failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance.
