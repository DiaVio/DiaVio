The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of around 112 kmph (70 mph), which was greater than a reasonable standard of safe driving given the slick roadway conditions caused by the rain. The driver of V1 made a decision error by traveling too fast for the conditions, resulting in the vehicle hydroplaning and losing control. This ultimately led to V1 rotating counterclockwise and making contact with V2, as well as colliding with the barrier wall. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Mercedes Benz) was traveling at a speed of about 105 kmph (65 mph), which was within the posted speed limit. V2 was in the far right lane and did not contribute to the crash. The driver of V2 was not aware of V1 until feeling the impact and then observed V1 spinning out of control. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the wet roadway conditions.
