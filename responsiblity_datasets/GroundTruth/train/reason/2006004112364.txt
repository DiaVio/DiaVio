The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. The driver of V1 did not look into travel lane 1 before continuing with the turn, which resulted in V1 entering the direct path of V2 (the 2000 Ford Windstar). This recognition error and inadequate surveillance by the driver of V1 led to the collision. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the non-contact vehicle and the fact that V1 was stopped for longer than 10 seconds waiting for a clear path to make the left turn also contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly assess the intersection and ensure a safe left turn.
