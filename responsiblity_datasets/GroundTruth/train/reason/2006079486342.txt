The reason for this is that multiple witnesses stated that V1 did not stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 herself admitted to not seeing the other vehicle because of a tree on the northeast curb. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to adequately surveil the intersection and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
