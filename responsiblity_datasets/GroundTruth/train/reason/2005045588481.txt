The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced chest pains and was unable to brake sufficiently, resulting in the collision with the back of Vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle #1 reported having chest pain for the past week and also mentioned experiencing chest pains at the time of the crash. An ECG conducted at the hospital indicated an abnormal T-rhythm. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was issued a citation for no proof of insurance. Vehicle #2 (the 2004 Ford F-150 pickup) was stopped at the intersection, waiting for traffic to clear before making a left turn. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he had been stopped for several seconds prior to the impact and was not injured in the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's medical condition and inability to brake due to chest pain, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
