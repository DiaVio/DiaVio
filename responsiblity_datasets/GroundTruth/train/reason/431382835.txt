The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver was the occupant of V1 and sustained multiple injuries as a result of the crash. The injuries, including rib fractures, pneumothorax, sternum fracture, abdominal and pelvic injuries, as well as upper and lower extremity injuries, were caused by the impact and the loading of the seat belt and steering assembly. The injuries were likely a direct result of the driver's interaction with the vehicle components during the crash.
