The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, causing the collision with V2. The driver of V1 admitted that she did not see the stop sign because it was covered by a tree, but this does not excuse her from the responsibility of stopping at the sign. Additionally, an independent witness stated that there have been several crashes in the past few weeks due in part to the obstructed stop sign, indicating that the driver should have been aware of the potential danger and taken extra caution. V2, on the other hand, was following the rules of the road and was unable to avoid the collision with V1, as V1 failed to stop at the stop sign. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
