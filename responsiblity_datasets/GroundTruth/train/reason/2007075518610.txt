The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while trying to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle. This overcompensation caused V1 to steer sharply to the left, resulting in the vehicle rotating counterclockwise and ultimately crashing into the median guardrail. The driver's choice of inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action, along with the inexperience of the seventeen-year-old driver, contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver's vision impairment (not wearing glasses) and the possibility of exterior distractions may have further hindered her ability to react appropriately in the situation.
