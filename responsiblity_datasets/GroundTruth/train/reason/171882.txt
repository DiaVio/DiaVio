The reason for this is that V3 was passing V1 on the right, which is an unsafe maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V3 drifted into the left eastbound lane, causing the left side of V3 to strike the right side of V1. This initial collision caused V1 to veer into the center turn lane and subsequently collide with V2 in an oblique, offset-frontal configuration. Since V3 fled the scene, it further indicates their responsibility for the accident.
