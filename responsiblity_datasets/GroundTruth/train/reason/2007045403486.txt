The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle while making a left turn at the intersection. The driver reported that she applied her brakes to decelerate, but the vehicle slid into and struck the curb. This indicates poor directional control, which is the critical reason for the crash. The driver's age and medical condition (high blood pressure and medication) were not considered contributing factors to the crash.
