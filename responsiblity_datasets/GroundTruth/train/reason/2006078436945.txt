The driver of V1 fell asleep while traveling on the straight roadway, which caused them to strike the rear of V2 and subsequently push it into the rear of V3. The fact that V1 had just come from the hospital after undergoing a sleep apnea test suggests that the driver's drowsiness was a contributing factor to the crash.
