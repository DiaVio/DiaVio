The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to negotiate a right-hand curve and entered the eastbound lane, ultimately crossing the yellow lane line and striking V2 (the Chevrolet Silverado). The driver of V1 stated that something flew into his eye, causing him to lose sight of the road. This distraction led to a recognition error, resulting in V1 encroaching into the opposite lane and colliding with V2.
