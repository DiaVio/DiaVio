The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a driver error by traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of the phantom vehicle in front of him. Additionally, the driver's age and lack of driving experience (being only 17 years old and having been licensed for only 5 months) were associative factors that contributed to the crash. The driver was also issued a ticket for failure to use due care.
