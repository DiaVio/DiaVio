The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Van) and made a false assumption that V2 was going to turn at the intersection. The driver of V1 also looked away from V2 in the opposite direction when entering the intersection, indicating inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance are the main reasons for the accident.
