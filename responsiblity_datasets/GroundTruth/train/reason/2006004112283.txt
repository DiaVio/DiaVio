The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was driven by an unlicensed driver who took the vehicle without permission. - The driver of V1 attempted to pass a stopped vehicle on the right before making a left turn, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1 did not slow down or attempt to avoid the collision with V2. - The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 89 kmph (55 mph) when making the left turn, which is significantly above the posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). - The driver of V1 fled the scene of the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. These factors demonstrate that V1's driver exhibited reckless behavior, violated traffic laws, and failed to exercise proper caution and awareness, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
