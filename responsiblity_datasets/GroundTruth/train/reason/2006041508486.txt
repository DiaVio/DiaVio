The reason for this is that V1 attempted to cross the roadway without properly checking for oncoming traffic. The driver admitted that she did not look to see if anyone was coming before pulling out. This indicates a driver-related decision error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, V1 did not use a turn signal while attempting to make the maneuver, which further contributed to the lack of awareness for other drivers on the road. While V2 (the driver of the Ford Expedition) did see the parked car, he did not anticipate that V1 would pull in front of him. V2 applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time due to the sudden movement of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to properly check for oncoming traffic and failure to use a turn signal makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
