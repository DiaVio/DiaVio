The driver of V1 made a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Ford F-150) without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 falsely assumed that V2 was going to turn right based on the activated right turn blinker, which led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking to the passenger, which contributed to the inattention and failure to properly assess the situation. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions, combined with the driver's inattention, led to the accident and makes V1 primarily responsible.
