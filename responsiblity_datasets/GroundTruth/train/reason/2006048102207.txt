The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to glancing to her right, which caused her to depart from the right road edge. This indicates a lack of attention and focus on the road, leading to the initial departure from the roadway. Additionally, the driver's statement about steering in the direction she looks suggests a lack of proper control and overcompensation, which further contributed to the crash. The fact that V1's driver was distracted by an external factor and potentially influenced by a combination of medications also adds to her responsibility for the accident. Overall, V1's driver's actions and lack of attention, combined with overcompensation and potential impairment, make her primarily responsible for the crash.
