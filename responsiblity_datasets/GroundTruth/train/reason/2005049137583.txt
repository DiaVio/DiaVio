The driver of V1 stated that she temporarily lost consciousness prior to the impact, which resulted in V1 departing its original travel lane and ultimately colliding with a light pole in the median. The driver's loss of consciousness may have been due to a combination of factors, including fatigue and the effects of pain management medication (hydrocodone) that she had taken. Additionally, the driver received citations for not having a driver's license and failure to maintain financial responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired state and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
