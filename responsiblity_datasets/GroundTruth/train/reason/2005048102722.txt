The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to changing lanes without adequately checking for other vehicles. She stated that she looked in her side mirror but did not see Vehicle 2. Additionally, she mentioned that she typically turns her head when changing lanes but failed to do so this time. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "Driver related factor: inadequate surveillance [e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see]." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that the lane was clear before changing lanes. On the other hand, there is no information provided about the driver of Vehicle 2, and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the available information, Vehicle 2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
