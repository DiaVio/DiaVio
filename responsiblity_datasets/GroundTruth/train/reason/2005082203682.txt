The reason for this is that V2 had stopped behind a left turning vehicle at an intersection with no control devices. After the vehicle turned left, V2 began to accelerate, indicating that it was safe to proceed forward. However, V2 was struck in the rear by V1. V1's statement that V2 stopped suddenly in front of her is contradicted by the fact that there was no reason for V2 to be stopped at that location, as the curve ended over 100 meters prior to the point of impact, eliminating any sight line restrictions. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe distance and misjudgment of the gap or V1's speed makes V2 primarily responsible for the collision.
