The reason for this is that multiple witnesses reported seeing V1 weaving in and out of traffic, crossing over lanes, and departing the roadway multiple times before the collision occurred. The driver of V1 also admitted to driving on a suspended license and taking medication for anxiety, which could have impaired his ability to drive safely. Additionally, the driver tested positive for benzodiazepines and cocaine, indicating drug use at the time of the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2000 Kenworth tractor-trailer) was not found to be primarily responsible for the crash. The driver of V2 reported feeling like he had a tire blowout at the time of impact and immediately started decelerating to pull over. He did not exhibit any signs of aggressive driving or being in a hurry, and his vehicle sustained minimal damage. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their erratic driving behavior, drug use, and potential impairment.
