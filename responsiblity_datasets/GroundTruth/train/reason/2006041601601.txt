The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling eastbound and made contact with the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. - The driver of V1 had a history of medical problems and was taking medications with various side effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, and confusion. These side effects could have impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver of V1 did not comply with a restriction on her license to wear corrective lenses, indicating a disregard for traffic regulations. - The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as a recognition error and inattention, suggesting that the driver was not paying attention to the traffic signal or failed to recognize the red light. - The driver of V1 also failed to stop for the traffic control device, indicating a violation of traffic laws. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
