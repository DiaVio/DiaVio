The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and was unable to stop in time, resulting in a rear-end collision. The driver of V1 noticed that V2 was stopped but was unable to brake effectively, indicating a possible error in judgment or vehicle control. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 left the scene of the crash further suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance and leaving the scene of the crash.
