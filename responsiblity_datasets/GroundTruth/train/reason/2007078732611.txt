The reason for this determination is that V1 departed the right side of the roadway, crossed the centerline, and then overcompensated by steering to the right. This resulted in the vehicle rotating clockwise, crossing the southbound lane, and ultimately rolling over after striking a dirt berm. Although the critical reason for V1's actions could not be fully determined, it is clear that the driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control and overcompensation, which contributed to the rollover. Additionally, the fact that the driver and any passengers left the scene and could not be located suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability.
