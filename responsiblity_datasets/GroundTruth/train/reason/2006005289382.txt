The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the T-intersection, preparing to make a right turn. As V1 entered the intersection, it struck the right front of V2 (the 1996 Dodge Intrepid) which was approaching the intersection from the northbound direction. V1's failure to yield the right of way to V2, which was continuing straight through the intersection, indicates that V1 did not properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the turn. This is considered a driver error and is the critical reason for the accident.
