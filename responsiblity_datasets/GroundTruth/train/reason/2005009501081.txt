The driver of V1 stated that he returned his attention forward from the rearview mirror to notice the signal light change, but he was unable to stop in time. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not adequately surveilling the road ahead and failed to stop in response to the changing signal light. Therefore, the primary reason for the accident is the driver of V1's inadequate surveillance.
