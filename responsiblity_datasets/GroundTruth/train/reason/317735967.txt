The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was negotiating a sharp left curve and lost control of the vehicle, causing it to slide towards the right roadside. The driver then steered left in an attempt to regain control, but this maneuver caused V2 to drift into the opposing lane, resulting in the collision with V1. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V2 led to the initial impact and subsequent rotation of both vehicles, ultimately causing the accident.
