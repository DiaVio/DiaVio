The driver of V1 attempted to make a lane change to his left while merging, indicating a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of other vehicles. This action resulted in the collision with V2 (the 2004 GMC 1500 extended cab pickup) and subsequently caused V3 (the 2007 Dodge Caravan) to be involved in the collision as well.
