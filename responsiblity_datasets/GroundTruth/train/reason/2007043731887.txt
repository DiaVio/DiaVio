The reason for this is that the driver reported a transmission failure, which caused the wheels to lock up and resulted in him losing control of the vehicle. As a driver, it is the responsibility of V1 to ensure that their vehicle is in proper working condition before operating it on the road. In this case, the driver's failure to maintain the transmission or address any potential issues with it led to the accident.
