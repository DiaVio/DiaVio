The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to changing lanes and not looking far enough ahead before slamming on the brakes, resulting in a rear-end collision with Vehicle #2 (1997 Eagle Vision). This action initiated a chain reaction, causing Vehicle #2 to rear-end Vehicle #3 (1998 Plymouth Neon). The driver of Vehicle #1's failure to maintain a safe distance and not paying enough attention to the road ahead led to the collision.
