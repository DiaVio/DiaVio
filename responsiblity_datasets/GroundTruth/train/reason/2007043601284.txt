The driver of V1 reported consuming alcohol before the crash, having two beers at a bar. Alcohol impairment can significantly affect a driver's judgment, coordination, and reaction time, making it more likely for them to lose control of their vehicle. Additionally, the driver alleged that a phantom vehicle turned into her lane, causing her to swerve and lose control. However, there is no evidence or witness testimony to support the presence of a phantom vehicle. Furthermore, the physical evidence at the scene suggests that V1 overreacted to a simple adjustment for her vehicle's path, resulting in overcompensation and loss of control. This indicates poor directional control and inattentiveness on the part of the driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to alcohol impairment, overcompensation, poor directional control, and inattentiveness.
