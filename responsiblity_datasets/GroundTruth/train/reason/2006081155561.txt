The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield to oncoming traffic, specifically V1. V1 had the right of way with a green light and was traveling straight through the intersection. V2's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision.
