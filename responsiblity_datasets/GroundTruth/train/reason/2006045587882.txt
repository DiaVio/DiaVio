The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver of Vehicle #1 experienced an unknown recognition error, which caused the vehicle to edge off the right side of the road and collide with a stone mailbox. The driver admitted to being unfamiliar with the vehicle and the roadway, as he had purchased the vehicle only three days before the crash and was taking a different route than usual. Additionally, there were likely external or internal distractions, although the driver did not admit to taking his eyes off the road. These factors indicate that the driver's lack of familiarity and potential distractions contributed to the accident.
