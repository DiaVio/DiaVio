The driver of V1 admitted to being lost and distracted by using his Blackberry while driving. He also made a false assumption about the intentions of V2 (the driver of the Hyundai SUV) and proceeded to make a right turn without yielding the right of way. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Therefore, V1's failure to yield right of way, distracted driving, and false assumption make them primarily responsible for the accident.
