The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the approaching V2 vehicle. This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the intersection resulted in V1 entering the intersection and being struck by V2. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and caution at the stop sign makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
