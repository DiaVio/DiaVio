The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling at a speed of 97 km/h (60 mph) in a residential area where the speed limit is 56 km/h (35 mph). Additionally, V1 drifted to the left and departed the trafficway, striking a mailbox with the left rear fender area. It then continued northward, entered the left hand segment of the S-curve, and departed the trafficway again, ultimately striking a tree with the right front fender. The excessive speed and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the main factors contributing to V1's primary responsibility in this crash.
