The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost consciousness, causing the vehicle to drift across the centerline, depart the roadway, and strike a telephone pole. The critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, and the critical reason for this event was a driver-related factor, specifically a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. The driver blacked out, and there were associated factors such as a history of migraines, hypertension, high cholesterol, and the use of medications to control these conditions. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with both the vehicle (as it was a rental) and the roadway (first time on the roadway), and fatigue was also a contributing factor.
