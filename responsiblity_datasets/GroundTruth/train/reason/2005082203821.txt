The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. Both drivers stated that they did not see the other vehicle until the crash was imminent, but V2 specifically mentioned that he looked both left and right before entering the intersection. However, despite this claim, V2 still collided with the right side of V1. Additionally, V2 should have been driving more defensively due to the size of the roadways and the presence of on-street parking on both sides of the roadway. V1, on the other hand, was traveling on the dominant roadway with adequate space for two-way travel. Therefore, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and exercise caution while entering it makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
