The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was making a left turn at the intersection, which was a critical pre-crash event coded as "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection." The critical reason for this event was coded as "Turned with an obstructed view." This indicates that V1 did not have a clear view of oncoming traffic and proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was waved on by a non-contact vehicle, which may have contributed to the driver's decision to proceed with the turn. However, it is important to note that the responsibility ultimately lies with the driver of V1 to ensure that it is safe to make the turn. On the other hand, V2 (the 2007 Nissan Sentra) was traveling straight through the intersection and was not at fault for the collision. Although V2 was driving with a suspended license, this does not directly contribute to the cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to making a left turn with an obstructed view, resulting in the collision with V2.
