The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was traveling south on the two-lane undivided roadway and crossed over the left side double yellow lines into the northbound lane, ultimately impacting the front left of Vehicle #2 (white 1992 Nissan Sentra). The critical pre-crash event coded to Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that Vehicle #1 was in the wrong lane at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 had a previous diagnosis of sleep apnea and was taking medications for diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression, which could have potentially caused drowsiness or lethargy. A witness also described the driver as looking "like she fell asleep." These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle #1 may have been impaired or fatigued, leading to the crossing of the lane lines and the subsequent crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 (red 2003 Buick Century) is primarily responsible for the crash.
