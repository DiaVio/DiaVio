The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted that the sun glare prevented him from seeing V2 (the Nissan pickup) stopped in the roadway. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not wearing his required glasses, which would have helped improve his vision. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and failed to see the stopped traffic in front of him, resulting in the collision.
