The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a speed of approximately 15 mph, which is significantly below the posted speed limit of 45 mph. Additionally, V2 swerved into the southbound lane to pass a non-contact vehicle, which is a dangerous maneuver. This resulted in a head-on collision with V1, causing severe injuries to the driver of V1.
