The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in a northerly direction and attempted to turn left into a driveway, crossing the path of V1. This resulted in a right frontal offset collision between V2 and V1, causing V1 to rotate and subsequently sideswipe V3. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn is the primary cause of the crash.
