The reason for this is that V2 locked up its brakes and swerved to the left, departing its lane to avoid Vehicle 3 (V3). As a result, V2 impacted the back left corner of V3 before crossing over the centerline into the southbound lane, where it collided head-on with Vehicle 1 (V1). This indicates that V2's actions of swerving and crossing into the opposite lane were the direct cause of the accident.
