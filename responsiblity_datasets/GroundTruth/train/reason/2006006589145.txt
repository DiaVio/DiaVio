The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by adjusting the radio and looking down at the instrument panel. This distraction likely caused him to not notice V2 merging into lane one and subsequently colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain proper attention and awareness of the road conditions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
