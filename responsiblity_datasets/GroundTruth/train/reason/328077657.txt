The reason is that the driver of V1 did not adequately ensure a clear path while traveling through the interchange area. Despite V2 exiting the interstate and turning left, V1 struck V2 on the left front quarter panel, indicating V1 did not take proper precautions or react in time to prevent the collision. This suggests that V1's driver did not yield to V2, which had the right of way when exiting.
