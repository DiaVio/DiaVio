The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions. The driver of V1 did not anticipate that V2 would stop for the ambulance, resulting in V1 being unable to stop in time and colliding with the rear of V2. Additionally, V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of others, which further contributed to the crash. The presence of the driver's physical health issues and severe cold/flu symptoms may have also affected their ability to react appropriately in the situation.
