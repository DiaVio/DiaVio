The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it crossed the center line, drove off the road, struck a sign-post, a wooden rail fence, and ultimately collided with a tree in a right, off-set, frontal-impact mode. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the sequence of events leading to the accident.
