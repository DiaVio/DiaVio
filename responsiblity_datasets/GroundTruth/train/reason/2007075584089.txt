The reason for this is inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. The driver of V1 failed to look to the right in their direction before proceeding into the intersection. This lack of awareness of V2's presence led to the driver of V1 steering hard to the left to avoid a collision, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the left side of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately survey the intersection and be aware of the presence of V2.
