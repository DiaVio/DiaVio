The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to regain control of the vehicle after attempting to avoid a collision with a deer. As a result, Vehicle 1 departed the roadway, collided with a fence and a tree, and ultimately came to rest off the road. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent it from leaving the roadway indicates a lack of proper handling and control, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
