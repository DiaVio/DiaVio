The driver of V2 was attempting a left turn from the fourth lane of traffic at the intersection, which requires yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic. However, the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, potential distraction from the communication equipment in the truck cabin, and fatigue could have contributed to the decision to make the left turn despite noticing V1 approaching the intersection.
