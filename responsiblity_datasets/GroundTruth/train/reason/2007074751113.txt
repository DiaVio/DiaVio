The reason for this is that V1 departed the right side of the roadway, entered the sidewalk, and subsequently contacted a wooden fence and a tree. The witness observed V1 departing the roadway without any avoidance actions, and the tire marks leading up to the impacts suggest that V1 was tracking towards the initial point of impact with no attempt to avoid the collision. While the exact reason for V1 departing the roadway is unknown without further interview information, it is clear that V1's driver failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
