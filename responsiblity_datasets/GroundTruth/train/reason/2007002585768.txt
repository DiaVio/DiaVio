The driver of V1 lost control of the car multiple times, driving off the right side of the roadway, crossing into the southbound lane, and eventually striking a fence, guide wire, stonewall, and sapling before coming to a final rest off the roadway. The driver's poor directional control, as indicated by the Critical Precrash Event, was a driver performance error. Several factors contributed to the driver's poor performance. The driver was inattentive due to thinking about personal problems, fatigued from lack of sleep, and inexperienced as it was her first time on the roadway. Additionally, the driver was suffering from untreated depression and had recently stopped taking her medication, which may have affected her mental state and decision-making abilities. Although alcohol involvement was suspected by the police, the driver refused to take a BAC test. However, the witness at the scene mentioned a "booze smell" when approaching the car. Overall, the combination of driver errors, including inattention, fatigue, inexperience, and potential impairment, led to V1 being primarily responsible for the crash.
