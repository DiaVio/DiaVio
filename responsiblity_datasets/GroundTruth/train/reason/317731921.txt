The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it accelerated through the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (2004 Mercury Grand Marquis) traveling east in the right straight lane of the eastbound lanes. This resulted in the front of V2 contacting the right side of V1, causing both vehicles to move southeast in the intersection and collide with V3 (2004 BMW Z4) that was stopped at the traffic light in the northbound lanes.
