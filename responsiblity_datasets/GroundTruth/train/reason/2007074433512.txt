The driver of V1 experienced a hypoglycemia insulin reaction, which impaired his ability to act and control the vehicle. This is evident from the witness statement that V1 was swerving on and off the road prior to the crash. The driver's medical report also confirms the hypoglycemia insulin reaction. As a result of this impairment, V1 traveled off the road and collided with V2, which was legally parked and unoccupied. Therefore, V1's impaired condition and subsequent actions make them primarily responsible for the crash.
