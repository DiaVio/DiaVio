The reason for this is that the investigation and vehicle inspection contradicted the driver's claim that another vehicle attempted to pass and clipped the right side of V1. Instead, it was found that V1 ran off the left side of the roadway and struck the concrete median barrier. The driver's inattention, as indicated by the critical reason coded as "day dreaming," also played a role in the accident.
