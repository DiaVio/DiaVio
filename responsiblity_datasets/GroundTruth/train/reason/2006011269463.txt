The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 hit a pothole and overcorrected when steering to the left. This overcorrection caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, cross the eastbound lane, and ultimately leave the road on the left side. The driver's overcompensation and loss of control of the vehicle led to the crash.
