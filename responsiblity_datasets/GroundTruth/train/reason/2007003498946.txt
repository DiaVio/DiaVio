The driver of V1 reported that the right side suspension of his vehicle failed, causing him to lose control and collide with V2 (the Mercedes Benz). The driver attempted to steer left but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, the failure of V1's suspension system is the main reason for the accident.
