The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve, which was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted to feeling fatigued and "hung-over" at the time of the accident, indicating that impaired judgment and physical condition may have contributed to the loss of control. The presence of bald tires on V1 also suggests a lack of proper vehicle maintenance, which could have further compromised the driver's ability to navigate the curve safely.
