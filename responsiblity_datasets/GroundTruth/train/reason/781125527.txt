The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a slight, uphill, left curve on a bridge that was slick due to patches of 'black ice'. The vehicle's rear-end started slipping from side to side, causing the driver to steer left. However, this maneuver resulted in the vehicle entering into a counterclockwise yaw and ultimately leaving the roadway. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle on the slippery bridge and her subsequent steering maneuver that led to the vehicle leaving the roadway indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
