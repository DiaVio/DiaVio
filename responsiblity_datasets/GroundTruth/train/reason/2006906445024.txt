The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed from its lane, crossed the westbound travel lane, and entered the parking lane where V2 was legally parked. V1 struck the left rear corner of V2, indicating that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and failed to avoid the collision. Additionally, the police reported that V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph, which was too fast for the conditions. This suggests that V1 was driving recklessly and not exercising proper caution on the road.
