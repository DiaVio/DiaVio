The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 partially departed the right pavement edge onto the grass shoulder while negotiating a right curve on a downhill slope. The driver of Vehicle 2 then steered left in an attempt to reenter the road, which initiated a counterclockwise rotation. As a result, Vehicle 2 crossed the westbound lane and collided with the frontal area of Vehicle 1. This initial impact caused severe damage to Vehicle 2 and moderate damage to Vehicle 1. The counterclockwise rotation of Vehicle 2 was further compounded by a secondary impact with the left rear area of Vehicle 1. This secondary impact resulted in moderate damage to both vehicles. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, including partially departing the road and initiating a counterclockwise rotation, led to the collision with Vehicle 1, making Vehicle 2 primarily responsible for the accident.
