The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop in time when V2 (the driver of the 1994 Oldsmobile 88 Royale LS) suddenly stopped to make a left-hand turn. The driver of V1 admitted that he may have been momentarily distracted by looking at the vehicle's radio, indicating a lack of full attention on the roadway. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded as a decision error - too fast to be able to respond to unexpected action of others, suggesting that V1 was traveling at a speed that made it difficult to react to sudden stops. On the other hand, V2 was following the appropriate speed limit and was familiar with the roadway. Although V2 was taking medication for seasonal allergies that could cause drowsiness, fatigue, and dizziness, this was not identified as a critical reason for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stop in time and their potential distraction.
