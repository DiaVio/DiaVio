The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at a stop sign and attempting to turn left. The driver of V1 stated that they looked both ways before pulling out into the road, but they did not see V2 (the Mazda 626) approaching. This indicates that V1 did not adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 was traveling northbound on the roadway and stated that V1 turned in front of them. V2 attempted to brake but could not avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 was driving within their lane and was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 approaching makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
