The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for a traffic control device, specifically the stop sign at the intersection. The driver of V2 admitted to stopping at the stop sign, looking in both directions, and then proceeding through the intersection without seeing V1. This indicates a lack of adequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, the driver's view was obstructed by other parked vehicles, which further contributed to the driver's failure to see V1 approaching. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the stop sign, inadequate surveillance, and sight line restrictions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
