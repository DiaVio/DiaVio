The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 ran the red light, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver caused the collision with Vehicle #2 (Ford Focus) and resulted in damage to both vehicles. Additionally, Vehicle #1 fled the scene, further demonstrating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
