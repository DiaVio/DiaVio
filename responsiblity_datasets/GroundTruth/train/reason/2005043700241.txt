The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize the presence of other vehicles in the lane and did not slow down or take appropriate action to avoid a collision. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a higher speed than the other vehicles, which further contributed to the rear-end collisions. The driver's lack of a proper CDL license for operating a medium truck hauling a tandem axle trailer also indicates a violation of regulations and potential negligence.
