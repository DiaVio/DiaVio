The driver of V1 failed to properly yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic on the westbound lanes. Despite stopping at the required area and proceeding into the median crossover area, the driver did not stop again before crossing the westbound lanes. This failure to yield and inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2 (the Volvo C70). Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway and misunderstood the presence of a wide median as indicating separate roadways. This confusion further contributed to the driver's failure to recognize the need to yield to westbound traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right-of-way and inadequate surveillance.
