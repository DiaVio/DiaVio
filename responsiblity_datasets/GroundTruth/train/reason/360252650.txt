The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw. V1 then departed the roadway, tripped over a downed tree, and began to rollover. The driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle, leading to multiple collisions with trees and ultimately coming to rest on its left side off the roadway. The primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 as they were unable to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to negotiate the curve safely, resulting in the rollover crash and subsequent injuries.
