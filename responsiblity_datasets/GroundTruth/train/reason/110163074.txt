The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southwest into the intersection in the right-hand travel lane of the 4-lane road, while V1 was traveling southeast in the left turn lane of a two-lane undivided road. Both vehicles continued into the intersection for unknown reasons, and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
