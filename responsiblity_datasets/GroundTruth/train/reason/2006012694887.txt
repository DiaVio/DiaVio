The driver of Vehicle 1 crossed over the center line of the roadway and failed to stop for the red traffic light, entering the path of Vehicle 2 (1996 Chevrolet S-10 pick-up). This action by the driver of Vehicle 1 directly caused the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, it is mentioned that Vehicle 1 had been running multiple traffic lights and a stop sign prior to the crash, indicating a pattern of reckless driving behavior. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error and aggressive driving behavior, as well as the failure to obey traffic signals.
