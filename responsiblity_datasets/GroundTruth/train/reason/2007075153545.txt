The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the slush-covered roadway conditions. This is evident from the police-reported travel speed of 48 kmph, which is below the speed limit of 105 kmph. However, considering the road conditions, the driver should have adjusted their speed accordingly to maintain control of the vehicle. Tapping the brakes due to traffic on the main lanes may have contributed to the loss of control, but ultimately, it was the driver's responsibility to ensure they were driving at a safe speed for the conditions.
