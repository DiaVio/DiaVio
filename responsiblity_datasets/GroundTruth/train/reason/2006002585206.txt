The reason for this is that V1 attempted an illegal maneuver by making a U-turn on a curved roadway. This action was not only against traffic regulations but also highly dangerous, especially considering the wet road conditions. Additionally, the witness reported that no brake lights were visible on V1 when it pulled to the side of the road, indicating a lack of proper signaling. While V2 did encroach into the eastbound lane in an attempt to go around V1, it can be argued that this was a reaction to V1's sudden U-turn. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, but there was not enough room to do so. Overall, V1's illegal maneuver and failure to properly signal were the primary factors that led to the crash.
