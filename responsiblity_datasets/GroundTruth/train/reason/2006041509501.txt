The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the intentions of the phantom vehicle in the median area. The driver assumed that the lack of a turn signal meant that the phantom vehicle was going straight, leading her to proceed into the intersection. However, the phantom vehicle made a left turn in front of V1, causing her to slow down and almost come to a complete stop in the middle of the eastbound lanes. This sudden hesitation and subsequent acceleration out of the witness's travel lane into the path of V2 (the 1996 Honda Accord) contributed to the collision. Additionally, factors such as the driver's inexperience (less than a year of driving experience and no driver's license) and the presence of a conversation with the passenger may have further impaired the driver's judgment and decision-making abilities. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption and subsequent actions that led to the collision.
