The reason for this is that V1 was exiting a plaza parking lot and entered the roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic. V1's driver stated that his view was obstructed by a vehicle pulling into the parking lot, but it is still the responsibility of the driver exiting the parking lot to ensure that it is safe to enter the roadway. V2 (the 1998 Buick Century) was traveling in the correct lane and did not have an opportunity to avoid the collision due to V1's failure to yield. V2's driver stated that her view was obstructed by the vehicle pulling into the parking lot, which indicates that she was not aware of V1's presence until the collision occurred. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield and enter the roadway safely.
