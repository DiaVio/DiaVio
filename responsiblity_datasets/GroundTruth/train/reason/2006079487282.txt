The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain proper surveillance and did not notice the traffic stopping ahead of him until it was too late. This lack of attention and inadequate surveillance led to the driver making a sharp right turn to avoid hitting the stopped traffic, resulting in V1 departing the roadway, impacting a curb and a fire hydrant, and ultimately coming to rest on the sidewalk. Additionally, the driver's claim of a bicyclist entering the roadway from the east curb of the north/south roadway was not supported by any evidence at the scene.
