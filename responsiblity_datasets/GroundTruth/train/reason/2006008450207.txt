The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, attempting to make a left turn across the path of V2. This illegal maneuver violated the traffic control device and directly caused the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving with a suspended license and without insurance, which further demonstrates their negligence and lack of responsibility.
