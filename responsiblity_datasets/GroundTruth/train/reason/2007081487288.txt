The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to stop in time and struck the rear of V2 (the 2001 Mazda Protégé). The critical reason assigned to the driver of V1 is a driver-related factor: following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of others. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the deceleration of V2. As a result, V1 collided with the rear of V2, causing the subsequent collision with V3 (the 1997 Toyota Avalon). It is important for drivers to maintain a safe following distance to allow for sufficient time to react to changes in traffic conditions. In this case, the driver of V1 failed to do so, resulting in the rear-end collision.
