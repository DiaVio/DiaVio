The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 reportedly experienced brake failure, which led to the vehicle driving off the right side of the road and ultimately colliding with a tree. Brake failure is considered a mechanical failure, and it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that their vehicle is in proper working condition before operating it on the road. Therefore, the driver of V1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
