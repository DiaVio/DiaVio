The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the 1997 Ford Explorer, made the decision to stop instead of continuing with the left turn when the protected left turn arrow expired and changed to a general green light. This unexpected action of stopping in the middle of the intersection without any apparent reason caused V1, the 1999 Ford Taurus, to collide with the rear of V2. V1, on the other hand, was following V2 and had the expectation that V2 would continue with the left turn, as both vehicles were in the left turn lane and the green arrow was illuminated. V1's driver made a false assumption of V2's action, assuming that V2 would turn without stopping. However, V1's false assumption does not absolve V2 of their responsibility for stopping abruptly and causing the collision.
