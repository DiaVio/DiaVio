The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2 (the 2002 Mazda Protégé) without signaling, which is a decision error and a violation of traffic rules. This action caused V2 to collide with V1's right rear. Additionally, the driver of V1 exhibited aggressive driving behavior by allegedly trying to accelerate just before the impact, which further indicates their responsibility for the accident. V2, on the other hand, was a 15-year-old permitted driver who was accompanied by her grandmother. While she may have been inexperienced, she was driving within the speed limit and reacted appropriately by slamming on the brakes when V1 turned in front of her. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their decision error, aggressive driving behavior, and failure to signal while making a left turn.
