The driver of V1 failed to slow down enough to navigate the right-hand curve properly, causing the vehicle to cross the center lane lines to the left. Although the driver attempted to steer right to avoid a guardrail impact, they were forced to steer hard left again. As a result, V1 departed the roadway and collided with a rocky outcropping, ultimately rolling over and coming to rest on its roof. The Critical Precrash Event was coded as a vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a driver-related error of traveling too fast for conditions. Factors such as driver inexperience, dangerously low tire tread, wet roadways, and roadway geometry that fails to meet AASHTO specifications were also associated with the crash.
