The driver of V1 reported that V2 suddenly stopped without warning, but there is no evidence to support this claim. V2 activated her left-turn signal and was waiting to turn left, which indicates her intention to slow down and stop. V1's driver failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to respond to the actions of V2 in a timely manner. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as "too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others," indicating that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a previous crash history and was cited for failure to reduce speed in the past. This suggests a pattern of irresponsible driving behavior. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to excessive speed and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
