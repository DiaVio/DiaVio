The reason for V1's primary responsibility is due to several factors: 1. V1 lost control of the trailer, causing it to sway and eventually jackknife. 2. The weight on the trailer was distributed incorrectly, which likely contributed to the instability of the trailer. 3. The ball mount on the power unit was too small for the load being towed, leading to a bent mount. 4. V1 was traveling at a high speed, which, combined with the load issues, likely initiated the jackknife event. 5. The driver of V1 was fatigued due to a demanding work and travel schedule, which may have impaired their ability to react and control the vehicle effectively. 6. The driver of V1 was conversing with passengers at the time of the crash, which could have further distracted them from maintaining proper control of the vehicle. These factors collectively indicate that V1's actions and decisions were the primary cause of the crash.
