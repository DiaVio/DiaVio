The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn from the third lane of traffic at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the 1992 Mazda Protoge) was traveling in the correct lane and had the right of way. V1 underestimated the speed of V2 or the gap in the traffic, leading to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was in a hurry and had left the scene before providing any information. This suggests a possible disregard for traffic laws and safety, further supporting V1's responsibility for the crash.
