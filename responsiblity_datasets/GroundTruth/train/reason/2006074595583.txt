The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is a clear violation of traffic rules. The driver's inattention due to thinking about his new home and finding the roadway confusing contributed to his disregard of the stop sign. This failure to stop resulted in V2 (the driver of the 2003 Ford F150 pickup) colliding with the right side of V1. While V2 may have tried to steer to the right just before impact, it is important to note that V2 was following the appropriate traffic control measures and was not at fault for the accident.
