The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was experiencing a hypoglycemic episode, which caused him to cross the centerline and initiate the sequence of events leading to the accident. The driver's medical condition impaired his ability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within his lane, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2 and the subsequent impact with the tree.
