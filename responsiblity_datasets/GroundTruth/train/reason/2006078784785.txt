The driver of V-1 was attempting a left turn from the left turn lane, and V-2 (the 1999 Mazda B2500 pickup) was traveling in the eastbound #2 lane. V-1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V-2, resulting in the front of V-2 striking the right side of V-1. Therefore, V-1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle.
