The reason for this is that v1 was making a left turn at the intersection and was struck on the left plane by the front plane of v2. This indicates that v1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, v1 then rotated and rolled over onto its right side, indicating a loss of control by the driver. Finally, v1 was further struck by the front and right planes of the 2011 Ford F150 Super Cab pickup truck (v3), suggesting that v1 was still in the path of oncoming traffic after the initial collision. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the actions of v1, it can be concluded that v1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
