The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the T-intersection, intending to travel south, and pulled directly into the path of Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2005 Nissan Altima sedan, which was traveling straight through the intersection. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the frontal impact.
