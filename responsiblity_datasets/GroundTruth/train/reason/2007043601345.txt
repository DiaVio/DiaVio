The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by placing his milkshake into a cup holder and looking down at it, which caused him to fail to notice the car in front of him slowing/stopping. As a result, V1 swerved into lane one and struck the back of V2 (the Ford Explorer), causing it to spin and roll onto its side. The impact between V2 and V3 (the Hyundai Elantra) was a secondary consequence of V1's initial collision with V2. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road are the main factors that led to the accident.
