The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was turning left at the intersection without a clear view. The driver of V1 had been looking through other vehicles' windows to see if it was clear, indicating inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 was in a hurry and running late for work, which may have contributed to her decision to turn without good sight clearance. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Toyota Tundra pick-up truck) was traveling in the correct lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the collision.
