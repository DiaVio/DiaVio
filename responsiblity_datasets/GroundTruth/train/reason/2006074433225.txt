The reason for this is that the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted and looking to the left at the time of the crash, as he was trying to move into lane two. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that V1 (the Gillig bus) was stopped in front of him in lane one, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," indicating that V2 had a clear view of the stopped bus but failed to react appropriately. Therefore, V2's distraction and failure to pay attention to the road ahead make him primarily responsible for the accident.
