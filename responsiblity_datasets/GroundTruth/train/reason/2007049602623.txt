The driver of V1 ran a red light at a high rate of speed, as confirmed by multiple witnesses. This action directly caused the collision with V2 (the 2002 Cadillac Deville) and subsequently with V3 (the 1997 Ford Taurus). The driver of V1 was also found to be under the influence of alcohol, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident.
