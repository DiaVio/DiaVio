The reason for this is that V2 was traveling west on the intersecting road and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. V2 claimed a vision impairment due to the sun, but it is the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and take necessary precautions in such conditions. V2 should have been more cautious and aware of their surroundings, especially when entering an intersection controlled by stop signs.
