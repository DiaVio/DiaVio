The reason for this is that V1 was exiting a parking space and attempting to merge into the number one lane. The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the traffic before merging and did not see V2 (the Chevrolet Trailblazer) approaching in the number one lane. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
