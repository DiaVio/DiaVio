The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. The driver was inexperienced with the route, was conversing with passengers, and was driving too fast for the conditions of towing the trailer and negotiating the curve. Additionally, the driver was experiencing difficulties with the engine overheating. These factors contributed to V1's departure from the road, the subsequent fishtailing of the trailer, and the ultimate rollover of V1.
