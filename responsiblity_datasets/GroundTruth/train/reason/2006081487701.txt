The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was attempting to turn westbound into lane one from a private driveway. - V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2. - V1 entered the roadway slowly and without a clear view of approaching vehicles due to non-contact in-transport stopped vehicles obstructing the view. - V1's mind was preoccupied with personal concerns, which may have affected their attention and decision-making abilities. - V1 mistakenly thought their foot was on the brake pedal but it was actually on the accelerator, causing the vehicle to lurch forward into the path of V2. - V1's vehicle was struck on the left side by the front of V2, indicating that V1 crossed into V2's path. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way, lack of clear visibility, and incorrect pedal usage contributed to the collision, making them primarily responsible.
