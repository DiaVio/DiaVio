The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the Lincoln Navigator) and failed to detect it until a few seconds before impact. Additionally, inadequate surveillance and inattention on the part of V1's driver played a role in not detecting V2 sooner. These factors indicate that V1's driver was not exercising proper caution and attention while driving, leading to the collision.
