The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and proceeded to cross the eastbound lane without ensuring it was clear. The driver of V1 stated that they could not see far enough ahead due to the fog, but it is their responsibility to ensure it is safe to proceed before entering the intersection. Additionally, V1's actions resulted in a collision with V2, causing V2 to be pushed into the path of V3, resulting in a secondary collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and proceed safely through the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
