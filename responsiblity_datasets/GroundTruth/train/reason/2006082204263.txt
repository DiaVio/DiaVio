The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before crossing. The driver of V1 stated that she only looked to the left before proceeding, which indicates a failure to properly check for oncoming traffic from the east (where V2 was traveling). This lack of proper surveillance led to V1 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2.
