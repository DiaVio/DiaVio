The reason for this is that V2 was traveling too fast to stop at the intersection when the signal turned red, according to a witness. Additionally, V2 was inattentive due to sun glare and was skidding longitudinally while applying the brakes in an attempt to avoid the crash. These factors indicate that V2 failed to exercise proper caution and control of their vehicle, resulting in the collision with V1.
