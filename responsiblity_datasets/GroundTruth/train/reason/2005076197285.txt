The driver of V1 was distracted internally while attempting to lower the sun visor to eliminate sun glare. This distraction caused the vehicle to wander to the right road edge. In an attempt to correct the vehicle's position, the driver overcompensated by steering left, causing V1 to cross the center line and run off the south road edge. The vehicle then struck an embankment before rotating counter-clockwise and coming to rest partially on the shoulder and partially on lane #2. The driver's internal distraction and overcompensation led to the loss of control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
