The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and looking down to adjust the radio, which caused her to not notice that V2 (the 2007 International tractor with trailer) was slowing down. Additionally, V1 did not attempt any evasive maneuvers and did not look back up until the impact occurred. These actions indicate a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
