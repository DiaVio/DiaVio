The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling south in lane one and made an unsafe maneuver by partially entering the right shoulder and then attempting a U-turn. This action created a hazardous situation as V2, the 1990 Ford F150, was also traveling south in lane one and attempted to pass V1. The impact occurred when V2 collided with the left side of V1, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to sideswipe V1. V1's unsafe maneuver of making a U-turn on a two-lane highway, without ensuring it was clear and safe to do so, directly contributed to the collision. Additionally, V1's failure to wear the available manual lap/shoulder belt may have increased the severity of the injuries sustained by the 66-year-old male driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the near-side impact crash due to its unsafe U-turn maneuver and failure to wear a seatbelt.
