The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at the traffic light instead of paying attention to the vehicles stopping for the construction zone. This external distraction caused V1 to fail to recognize that V2 had stopped in front of them, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was a new driver in the area and may not have been familiar with the road conditions and traffic patterns.
