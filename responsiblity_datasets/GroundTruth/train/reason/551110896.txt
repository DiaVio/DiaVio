The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling at a high speed and attempting to overtake another vehicle while entering a curved section of the road. V1 then failed to properly navigate the curve, resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with multiple objects, ultimately causing the vehicle to overturn. The driver of V1, a 16-year-old male, may have lacked the necessary experience and skill to handle the situation appropriately.
