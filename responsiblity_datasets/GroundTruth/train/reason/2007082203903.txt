The reason for this is that V1 veered off the road to the right, sideswiping V2 (the 1997 Mercury Villager minivan) and then colliding with V3 (the 1996 Ford F250 pickup) and other parked vehicles. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle within the lane. Additionally, the critical reason assigned to the driver of V1 is coded as unknown critical non-performance, suggesting that the driver may have been impaired or incapacitated in some way, possibly due to drugs and alcohol. The witness mentioned in the police report also stated that V1 traveled off the right side of the travel lane without any brake lights coming on or attempted evasive actions taken. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
