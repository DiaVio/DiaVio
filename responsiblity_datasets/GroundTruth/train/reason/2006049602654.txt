The driver of V2 admitted to running a red light, which was confirmed by a witness. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection" and the critical reason for the event was coded as a driver decision error: illegal maneuver. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the red light and illegally maneuver through the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
