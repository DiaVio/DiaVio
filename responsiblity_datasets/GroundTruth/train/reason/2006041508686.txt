The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of V2, who suddenly stopped when he realized he couldn't beat the drawbridge gates. V1's driver was in a rush to pick up her son from school and made a false assumption that V2 would continue to proceed. Additionally, the traffic flow congestion caused by the road construction was also a contributing factor. Therefore, V1's driver's decision to travel too fast and her false assumption, combined with the congestion and her rush to pick up her son, led to the collision with V2.
