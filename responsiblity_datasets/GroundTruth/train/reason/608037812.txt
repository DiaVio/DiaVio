The reason for this is that the case vehicle entered the path of an oncoming train while crossing the railroad tracks. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to yield to the train and exercise caution at the railroad crossing. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a lack of adherence to safety measures, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
