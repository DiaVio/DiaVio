The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one admitted to being distracted by reaching down to pick up his cell phone from the left floorboard of the vehicle. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that vehicle two was stopped ahead of him, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was coded as "Other motor vehicle in lane-other vehicle stopped," indicating that the driver's failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead was a contributing factor to the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and failure to notice the stopped vehicle, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident.
