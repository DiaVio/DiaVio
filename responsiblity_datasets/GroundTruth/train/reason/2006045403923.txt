The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the traffic congestion and the highway construction zone. Additionally, the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, which resulted in him being unable to respond to the sudden stop of V2. These factors, along with the driver's inexperience with this class of vehicle, contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
