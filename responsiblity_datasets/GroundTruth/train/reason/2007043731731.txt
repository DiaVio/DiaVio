The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was impaired, either due to medication or alcohol, as reported by the police. This impairment likely affected the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to V1 crossing the double-yellow line and departing the roadway. Additionally, the driver's history of multiple crashes and driving with a revoked license further indicates a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic laws.
