The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated to be in excess of 145 kmph (90 mph) by a witness. - V1 lost control and went off the roadway, indicating that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. - V1 went airborne multiple times, suggesting that the vehicle was traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. - The driver of V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.24, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling too fast for conditions, indicating that the driver's speed was a contributing factor to the accident. Overall, V1's excessive speed, loss of control, and impaired driving due to alcohol consumption make it primarily responsible for the accident.
