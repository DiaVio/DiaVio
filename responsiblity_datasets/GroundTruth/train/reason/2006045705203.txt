The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was driving inattentively and failed to look far enough ahead, resulting in inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V1 chose an inappropriate evasive action by swerving to the right instead of utilizing the open paved shoulder to the left. These actions led to the collision with the back of V2's trailer unit. Furthermore, V1 had a tire deficiency with low tire tread, which may have contributed to the crash. V2 (the driver of the International tractor) is not primarily responsible for the crash as he was driving within his lane and was unable to get out of the way due to the rapid approach of V1 from behind.
