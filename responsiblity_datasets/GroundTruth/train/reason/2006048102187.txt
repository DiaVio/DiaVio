The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn on a circular green light, but failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V1 admitted that she was focused on her turn destination and did not see V2 (the 1993 Chevrolet Caprice) until it was in front of her. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. On the other hand, V2 was traveling through the intersection with a circular green light and did not detect V1 in time to avoid the crash. While V2 failed to look to her left, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as they were the one making the left turn and had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic.
