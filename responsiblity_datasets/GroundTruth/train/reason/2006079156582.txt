The reason for this is that V1 executed a wide right turn into the second southbound lane without properly observing the approaching traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the Cadillac Seville). V1 reported that he did not see a vehicle turning right from southbound traffic, but he did mention that a vehicle was parked along the curb of southbound traffic past the intersection, which obstructed his view. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the path is clear before making a turn. V2, on the other hand, reported that his view of V1 was obstructed by a vehicle in the first southbound lane, which was turning right at the intersection. V2 honked his horn and applied his brakes, but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's improper turn, and he cannot be held primarily responsible for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to a driver-related decision error of turning with an obstructed view.
