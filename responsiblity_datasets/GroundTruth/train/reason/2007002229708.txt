The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection, stopped, and then proceeded to turn left, misjudging the speed of V2 (the Freightliner tractor) approaching from the opposite direction. V1's decision error and misjudgment of the gap or other's speed led to the collision. Additionally, V1 was potentially distracted by looking at the tollbooths and thinking about calling his wife, which may have contributed to his inattentiveness to the driving task.
