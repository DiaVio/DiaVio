The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve on a wet roadway. The driver overcorrected, causing V1 to travel across lanes and impact the guardrail. This initial impact resulted in minor damage. However, V1 then climbed over the guardrail and began to rollover multiple times down a steep slope, resulting in severe passenger compartment damage. The driver's loss of control and subsequent overcorrection ultimately led to the rollover crash.
