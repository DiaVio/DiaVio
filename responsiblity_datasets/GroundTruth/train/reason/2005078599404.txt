The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 failed to exercise adequate surveillance while turning left at the intersection. The driver of V2 stated that he looked but did not see the other car (V1), indicating a lack of attention and awareness of the surrounding traffic. This failure to properly observe and assess the situation led to the collision with V1. Additionally, V2 had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn. Even though traffic in the number two and three westbound lanes had stopped and left space for V2 to cross, it is still the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to ensure that it is safe to proceed. The driver of V2 failed to do so, resulting in the collision with V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield while making a left turn.
