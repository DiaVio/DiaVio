The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding to turn left. This is evident from the fact that V1 did not observe V2's approach prior to entering the intersection. The driver of V1 also reported that her view of eastbound traffic was partially blocked by a row of palm trees along the south curb. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
