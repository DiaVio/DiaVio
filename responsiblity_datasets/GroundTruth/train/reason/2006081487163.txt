The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver was distracted by looking up at the sign for the HOV lane termination. This external distraction caused him to take his eyes off the road and fail to notice that the cars in front of him had slowed down for traffic. As a result, V1 rear-ended V2, which then pushed V2 into the rear of V3. V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance are the main factors that led to the collision.
