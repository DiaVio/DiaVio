The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were driving too fast for the conditions. The critical reason for the accident was coded as "driver related error - driving too fast for conditions." V1 was traveling over the speed limit and did not slow down until they had a clear view of the object in the roadway. Additionally, V1's decision to steer to the left and into lane four, where V2 was traveling, contributed to the collision. V2 (the driver of the Mazda 6) was traveling within the speed limit and did not have any critical reasons coded to their vehicle. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
