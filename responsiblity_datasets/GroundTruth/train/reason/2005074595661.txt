The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V2 turned left in front of V1, causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 had an obstructed view due to the driver of another vehicle waving them on to make the left turn, which further contributed to the accident.
