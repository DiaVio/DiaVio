The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2, causing V2 to move forward and subsequently collide with the rear of V3. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, pre-crash skid marks were noted at the scene to be from V1, further suggesting that V1 was unable to stop in time. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and inability to stop in time are the primary reasons for the crash.
