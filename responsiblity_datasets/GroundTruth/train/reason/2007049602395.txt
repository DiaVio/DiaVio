The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was driving too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of V2, who slowed to a complete stop at the intersection. - The damage to both vehicles, the crash dynamics, and the scene evidence do not support V1's claim that V2 disregarded a stop sign and attempted to cross through the intersection. - V1's vehicle struck the back of V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. - Additionally, V1's impaired condition, with a blood/alcohol level of 0.199 and positive test results for PCP and Cannabinoids, further contributes to their responsibility for the crash. - V1's suspended license also indicates a disregard for traffic laws and regulations. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash at the intersection.
