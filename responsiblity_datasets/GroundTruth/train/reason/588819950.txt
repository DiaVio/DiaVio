The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 55-year-old female driver, struck the right side plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2004 Toyota 4Runner) during the collision sequence. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was stopped at the intersection and intended to pass through.
