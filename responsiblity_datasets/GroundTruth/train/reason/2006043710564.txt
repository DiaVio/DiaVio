The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that he failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical reason for the critical event was a decision error of inadequate surveillance - he looked but did not see V1 approaching. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, V2's claim of not seeing any vehicles coming suggests a lack of attention and awareness while driving.
