The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the 1986 Dodge Dakota, attempted to make a left turn in front of the northbound Saturn driven by V1. V2 admits to not using a turn signal and claims to have been blinded by sun glare, which prevented him from seeing the Saturn. Additionally, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This indicates that V2 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, leading to the head-on collision.
