The driver of V1 attempted to cross into the express lanes from the local exit lane, but failed to maintain control of the vehicle while doing so. This resulted in V1 impacting several traffic barrels and coming to a rest in the middle of the barrels and partially in the travel lane. The witness following V1 confirmed that there were no other vehicles involved in the crash and observed that V1 did not make any efforts to apply the brakes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and failure to properly maintain control of the vehicle while attempting to change lanes.
