The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reaching for a fallen soft drink. This distraction caused him to not pay attention to the roadway and resulted in him entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so. As a result, V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) was unable to avoid the collision and struck the left side of V1. It is important for drivers to remain focused on the road at all times and avoid distractions, such as reaching for items inside the vehicle. In this case, the distraction led to the driver of V1 failing to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the accident.
