The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The driver was negotiating a curve in heavy rain, which made the roadway wet and slippery. Additionally, the rear tires of V1 were almost bald, which would have further reduced traction. These factors, combined with the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle when it started to fishtail, indicate that V1 was not being operated safely given the road and weather conditions.
