The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by her cell phone and failed to notice that Vehicle #2 (the 1999 Ford Mustang) had come to a stop at the intersection. Despite attempting to brake and steer left, Vehicle #1 was unable to avoid colliding with the back left of Vehicle #2. Additionally, Vehicle #1 was charged with following too closely, indicating that the driver failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, failure to maintain a safe distance, and inability to avoid the collision.
