The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop in time to avoid hitting V2 (the 1996 Honda Civic) from behind. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash, which likely impaired their ability to recognize and react to the situation appropriately.
