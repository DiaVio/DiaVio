The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by turning her head to talk to her children in the back seat. When she turned her head forward, she realized that V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Monte Carlo) had come to a complete stop, but it was too late for her to react and she collided with the rear of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that the brake lights of V2 were not functioning, which may have contributed to her inability to perceive that V2 had stopped. However, it is important to note that the police discovered that the rear fender lamps of V2 were not functional, but the red center lamp in the back window was working. Therefore, while there may have been a lighting deficiency in V2, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to her distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her.
