The reason for this is as follows: - V1 exhibited poor directional control of the vehicle by failing to steer far enough to the left to avoid the impact. - V1 also displayed poor judgment by not yielding to the forward vehicle and reducing her speed. - Additionally, V1 made a false assumption that the other vehicle (V2) would remain stopped and let her pass. These factors, combined with the driver's fatigue and distraction from the recent argument, contributed to the collision.
