The driver allowed the vehicle to travel off the left roadside into the dirt median while negotiating a right curve. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, the driver's sudden turn back to the left due to another passing vehicle further contributed to the loss of control. These actions ultimately led to the vehicle tripping and rolling over, resulting in the ejection of the front right-seat passenger and the subsequent fatality.
