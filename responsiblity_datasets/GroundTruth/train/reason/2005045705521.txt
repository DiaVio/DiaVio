The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that it crossed the right lane line and impacted the back left corner of Vehicle #2 (the Volvo S90). This action caused Vehicle #2 to start rotating counterclockwise and ultimately resulted in it veering off the road and into a drainage ditch. Although Vehicle #1 claimed that it was trying to avoid a non-contact vehicle that was drifting into its lane, the driver's decision to cross the lane line and collide with Vehicle #2 demonstrates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance. The driver's attention was focused on the non-contact vehicle, which led to a failure to properly observe and react to the presence of Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 mentioned that his view may have been obstructed by his "rookie mirror" and long hood. This further indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surrounding traffic. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to its failure to maintain its lane and collide with Vehicle #2.
