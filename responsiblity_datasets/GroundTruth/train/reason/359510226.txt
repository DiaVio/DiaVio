The reason for this is that V2 lost control of the vehicle and departed its lane to the left, crossing multiple lanes and ultimately impacting an impact attenuator and the guardrail. This loss of control and subsequent actions by V2 led to the collision with Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2009 Mini Cooper, resulting in serious injuries to the driver of V1.
