The reason for this is that V2 was traveling on a two-lane, two-way highway and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which had stopped at the stop sign. V2 impacted the left side of V1 in the intersection, causing V1 to rotate and collide with V2. The impact forced V1 off the roadway and into a parking lot, resulting in serious injuries to the front right passenger of V1 and fatal injuries to the driver of V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way at the intersection.
