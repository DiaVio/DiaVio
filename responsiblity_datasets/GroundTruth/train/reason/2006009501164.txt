The driver of V1 stated that he began to depart the roadway to the right while entering the curve. This indicates that he failed to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve. Additionally, the driver mentioned attempting to steer left and apply more brake, but ended up in an uncontrolled spin that led to the collision with the pole. The critical pre-crash event was coded as vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, and the critical reason was identified as a driver-related factor of overcompensation. This suggests that the driver was not able to properly adjust his speed and control the vehicle while driving on wet roads and negotiating the curve. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control and adjust speed appropriately for the road conditions.
