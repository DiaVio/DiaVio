The reason for this is that the driver of V-3, while traveling behind V-2, looked in the rearview mirror to check on her children. This internal distraction caused her to take her eyes off the road momentarily. When she looked back, V-2 had stopped, and V-3's front collided with the back of V-2, causing V-2 to then hit the rear of V-1. Therefore, V-3's failure to maintain a safe distance and attention to the road resulted in the collision, making V-3 primarily responsible for the accident.
