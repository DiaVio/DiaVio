The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 crossed into the westbound lane and struck the front left of Vehicle #2 (1999 Honda Civic). This indicates that Vehicle #1 was not staying within its designated lane and encroached into the opposite lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was inconsistent in her statement to researchers and police, which suggests a lack of reliability. It is important to note that Vehicle #2 attempted to avoid the collision by partially departing the right side of the road and left skid marks, indicating an attempt to take evasive action. However, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for crossing into the opposite lane. Overall, Vehicle #1's failure to stay within its lane and encroaching into the opposite lane led to the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
