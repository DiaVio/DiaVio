The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop for the traffic control signal, even though she had a red light. She admitted to being inattentive to her driving task by looking down inside her vehicle. Additionally, she was not familiar with the new traffic signals that had recently been erected at the intersection. These factors contributed to her failure to yield the right of way and resulted in the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2).
