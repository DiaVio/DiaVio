The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle in the gore area while attempting to exit the interstate. The driver's unfamiliarity with the road, combined with the difference in steering feel compared to her normal car, contributed to the control loss. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are cited as critical reasons for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's actions and lack of control.
