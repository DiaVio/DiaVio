The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the case occupant was the driver of V1 and was found to be unbelted at the time of the accident. The lack of seatbelt usage contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the case occupant. Additionally, the case occupant's movement within the vehicle during the crash indicates that he was not properly restrained, leading to the various impacts with different parts of the vehicle's interior.
