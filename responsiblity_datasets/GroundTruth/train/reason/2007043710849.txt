The reason for this is that V2 was responding to an emergency call and entered the intersection without activating their emergency lights. This failure to turn on the emergency lights likely contributed to V1 (the driver of the Dodge Charger) not seeing V2 until the last second, resulting in the collision. If V2 had activated their emergency lights, it is likely that V1 would have seen them and yielded the right of way at the intersection. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 was in a hurry to get to the emergency call, which may have led to a lack of proper observation or failure to look right before entering the intersection. Therefore, V2's failure to activate the emergency lights and potentially failing to properly observe the intersection make them primarily responsible for the accident.
