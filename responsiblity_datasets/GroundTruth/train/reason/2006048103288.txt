The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Chevrolet Cavalier, attempted to make a left turn at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. The driver's attention was focused to the left, away from the direction of V1 approaching from. This decision to turn with an obstructed view led to the collision with V1.
