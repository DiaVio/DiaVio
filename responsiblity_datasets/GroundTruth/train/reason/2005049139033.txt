The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver stated that a tractor-trailer attempted to encroach onto her lane from the left. Instead of braking or taking appropriate evasive action, V1 steered to the right, resulting in the vehicle striking the west curb and coming to rest in a nearby intersection. This indicates that V1's inadequate evasive action, without braking, contributed to the crash.
