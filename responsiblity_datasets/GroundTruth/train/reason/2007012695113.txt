The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the GMC pick-up, initiated a left turn at the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1, the driver of the Oldsmobile sedan, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. V2's false assumption that V1 was going to turn left at the intersection led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, V2's use of prescription medication to treat depression may have impaired her judgment and contributed to the false assumption. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
