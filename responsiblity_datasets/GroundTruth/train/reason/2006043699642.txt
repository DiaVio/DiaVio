The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was engaging in aggressive driving behavior by accelerating aggressively and traveling at a high speed on a small, residential street within a school zone. This behavior, combined with the driver's inexperience and poor directional control, led to the loss of control of the vehicle and subsequent collision with a telephone pole and chain link fence. The investigating officer estimated V1's travel speed to be 72kmph (45 mph), which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph). Additionally, the driver's statement that he had just shifted into second gear when he lost control suggests that he was not properly controlling the vehicle. Overall, the driver's aggressive driving behavior and lack of control make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
