The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She claimed to have seen the oncoming bus slow down for the bus stop, but she did not detect V1 until impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and failure to look or see the oncoming vehicle, which ultimately led to the collision.
