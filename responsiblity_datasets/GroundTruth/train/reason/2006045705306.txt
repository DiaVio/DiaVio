The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 departed the right roadside and impacted a tree while apparently airborne, indicating that the vehicle left the road and lost control. - The driver of V1 stated that something caught her attention off to her left, and when she turned her head to the left to track it, her car left the road. - The driver's vision was impaired as she was not wearing her glasses, which could have affected her ability to properly perceive and react to the road conditions. - The driver was also distracted by her puppy, which was riding in the right front position, and this distraction could have further compromised her focus on the driving task. - Inexperienced driving and poor directional control were attributed to V1, along with the fact that the vehicle was out of alignment and pulled to the right. The driver and her parents were aware of this issue before the crash. Overall, V1's driver's external distraction, impaired vision, inexperience, poor directional control, and the presence of an internal distraction (the puppy) contributed to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
