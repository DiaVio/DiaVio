The reason for this is that the driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 would continue traveling without reaching a complete stop. This false assumption led to V1's front plane contacting the rear plane of V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was traveling in the number three lane, which indicates that V1 should have been aware of the traffic ahead and should have been prepared to stop or slow down accordingly. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to maintain a safe distance or react appropriately to the traffic ahead make them primarily responsible for the collision.
