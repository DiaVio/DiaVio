The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and crossed over the intersection, colliding with the right side of V1, which was southbound. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection." Although the reason for this critical pre-crash event is unknown, it indicates that V2 failed to yield or properly navigate the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1.
