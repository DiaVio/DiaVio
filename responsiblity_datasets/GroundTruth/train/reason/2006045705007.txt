The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the Critical Reason for V1 was coded as driver-related, specifically traveling too fast for conditions. The crash occurred in heavy rain with water accumulating on the roadway, which would have made the road slippery and reduced traction. Despite these poor road conditions, V1 lost traction while passing V2 and rotated counterclockwise, crossing in front of V2 and causing the collision. This indicates that V1 was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the conditions, leading to the loss of control and subsequent crash. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford F800 straight truck) was not primarily responsible for the crash. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane over the right lane line. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the initial collision, as V1 crossed into V2's lane. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned that all traffic had slowed down due to the rain, indicating that V2 was driving cautiously and in accordance with the conditions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the poor road conditions, while V2 is not primarily responsible as they were driving appropriately and were encroached upon by V1.
