The reason for this is that V2, for unknown medical reasons, traveled across the raised curb and into the westbound travel lane, traveling in the wrong direction. This action caused V2 to enter the intersection and collide with the left side of vehicle one (V1), the 2003 four-door Buick LeSabre. V2's failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and driving in the wrong direction ultimately led to the collision.
