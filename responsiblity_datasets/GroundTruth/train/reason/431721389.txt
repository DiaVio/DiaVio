The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to partially depart the road edge and subsequently collided with the parked Vehicle 2 (2008 Ford F-550 Super Duty Crew Cab). This initial impact caused moderate damage to Vehicle 1. Following the initial impact, Vehicle 1 then collided with the left side of the parked Ford pickup, resulting in additional overlapping moderate damage. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and collided with the parked vehicle. The subsequent rollover of Vehicle 1 was a result of rotational forces from the secondary impact and lateral motion of the left side wheels against the asphalt surface. This indicates that the driver's actions and loss of control contributed to the rollover event. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control and subsequent collisions.
