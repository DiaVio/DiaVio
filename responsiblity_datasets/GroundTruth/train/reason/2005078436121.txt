The driver of V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. This is evident from the critical reason for the pre-crash event being coded as "inadequate surveillance." The driver of V2 stated that he did not see any other vehicle in front of his vehicle, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. Additionally, the driver's medication for Alzheimer's disease may have contributed to his failure to properly observe the surroundings. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
