The reason for this is that V1 failed to obey a red traffic signal or yield the right of way when entering the intersection. The driver of V1 was also found to have provided false identification and insurance information, suggesting a lack of responsibility and potentially unfamiliarity with the vehicle. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V1 was the vehicle in motion at the time of the crash.
