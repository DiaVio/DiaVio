Reason: V1 drove off the road onto the shoulder and struck the rear of the parked semi trailer without any pre-crash avoidance actions. The witness following V1 stated that it was traveling at the speed limit when it veered off the road straight into the trailer. The driver of V1 may have become incapacitated or was unable to control the vehicle due to the pain in his hands, but there is no concrete evidence to support this. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
