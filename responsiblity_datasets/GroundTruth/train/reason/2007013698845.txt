The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the Plymouth Voyager minivan, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking both ways, V1 did not see V2, the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme sedan, approaching from the west. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2. While V2 did state that she saw V1 start to pull out in front of her and attempted to brake, the responsibility for the crash lies with V1 as they failed to properly assess the intersection before making their turn.
