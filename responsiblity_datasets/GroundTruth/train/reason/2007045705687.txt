Reason: V1 was driving at a high rate of speed, weaving aggressively, and applying brakes abruptly before skidding into the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to drinking alcohol before the crash and had a history of violent behavior. The police also coded V1 as too fast, reason unknown, indicating that the driver was likely exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, V1's blown front tire and subsequent loss of control further demonstrate the driver's negligence.
