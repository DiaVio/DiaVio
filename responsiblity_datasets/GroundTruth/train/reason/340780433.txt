The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it was the vehicle that departed the west edge of the intersection road, swiped a wooden sign post, and ultimately collided with a utility pole. The driver of V1 reported being blinded by the sun, which may have contributed to their inability to see and avoid the obstacles in their path. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 sustained multiple moderate injuries, indicating that they were likely the one in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. The fact that the passenger in V1 was unrestrained further suggests that the driver was responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle. Overall, the actions and circumstances surrounding V1, including the driver being blinded by the sun and the subsequent collision with the sign post and utility pole, indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
