The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling at a speed of approximately 97 kph (60 mph) in a 72 kph (45 mph) speed limit zone. This indicates that V1 was exceeding the speed limit, which could have contributed to the loss of control during the left-hand curve. Additionally, V1 went into a counterclockwise yaw and skidded off the left side of the roadway, suggesting that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve.
