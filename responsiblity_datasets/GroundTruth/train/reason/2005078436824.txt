The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a left turn at the intersection without having a clear line of sight due to the school bus turning right in front of them. This obstructed view led to the collision with V2 (the 2002 Bluebird school bus). V1's decision to turn without a clear view of oncoming traffic was the critical reason for the accident.
