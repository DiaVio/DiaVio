The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while attempting to turn right into a fast food restaurant driveway. The driver stated that she had been feeling sleepy throughout her drive and had been shaking her head and rolling down the window in an attempt to remain awake. The driver reported that she did not remember anything past beginning her turn, indicating that she was asleep at the time of the crash. The Critical Precrash Event was coded as 'this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side' and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as 'driver related error-critical non-performance error-the driver was asleep'. Additionally, a Contributing Factor of 'driver fatigue' was coded, as the driver had started a new prescribed medication for treatment of Lupus four weeks ago, which made her tired. The driver also has epilepsy and reported feeling fatigued every day since taking the new medication. The driver's physical factors and related prescribed medications, including seizure disorder medication and medication for depression, were also coded as Contributing Factors, as they have possible side effects of drowsiness, tiredness, and dizziness. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of falling asleep, the evidence of fatigue, and the contributing factors of medication and medical conditions, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
