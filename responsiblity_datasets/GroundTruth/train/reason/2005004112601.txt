The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite looking ahead, V1 did not see V2 approaching and proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in the collision. V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way to V2 led to the accident.
