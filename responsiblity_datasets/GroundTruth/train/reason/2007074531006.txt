The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 was distracted and did not notice V1 approaching the intersection. This is evident from the statement given by the driver of V2, who admitted that his focus was on ensuring he turned onto the correct road and he did not see V1 prior to the crash. This inadequate surveillance factor contributed to the collision. Additionally, V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires the driver to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. V1, being northbound, had the right of way and should have been able to proceed through the intersection without any issues. However, V2's failure to yield resulted in the collision. Therefore, V2's distracted driving and failure to yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
