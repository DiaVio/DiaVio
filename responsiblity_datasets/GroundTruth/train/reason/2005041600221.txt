The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was reportedly driving at a high rate of speed and changing lanes frequently, which is considered aggressive driving. This behavior contributed to the critical precrash event of traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The driver's aggressive driving and excessive speed led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (the Pontiac Sunfire), causing it to roll over. While Vehicle #2's driver was cited for driving without adult supervision and had a learner's permit, the critical reason for the crash was not coded to this vehicle. The driver of Vehicle #2 reported that another vehicle encroached into her lane, which suggests that she was not primarily responsible for the collision. In summary, Vehicle #1's aggressive driving and excessive speed, as well as the lane change that resulted in the collision, make it primarily responsible for the crash.
