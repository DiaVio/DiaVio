The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was arrested at the scene and charged with DUI, with a blood alcohol content of .226, well above the legal limit. - The driver admitted to consuming a significant amount of alcohol before the collision, which impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver's statement that V2 stopped suddenly during the yellow phase of the traffic signal indicates a lack of attention and recognition of the traffic situation. - The critical reason for the event, as coded, was a driver-related recognition error, indicating that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicle ahead and take appropriate evasive action. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's impaired state and failure to recognize and react to the stopped vehicle ahead.
