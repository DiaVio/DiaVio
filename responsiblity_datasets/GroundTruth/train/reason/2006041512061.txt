The driver of V1 made a recognition error and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the right turn. Despite looking to his left, the driver did not see the approaching V2 (the Honda Accord). This indicates a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and exercise caution while making the turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 panicked and applied the brakes only after committing to the right turn and being in the path of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
