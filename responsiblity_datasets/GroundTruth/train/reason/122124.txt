The driver of Vehicle 1 fell asleep while driving, which led to the vehicle departing the left side of the ramp and subsequently colliding with a sign post and a parked tractor-trailer. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and falling asleep at the wheel is the main reason for the accident. It is important to note that the driver was not wearing a seat belt, which further contributed to the severity of his injuries. The impact with the sign post and the subsequent collision with the tractor-trailer caused significant damage to the vehicle and resulted in severe injuries to the driver, ultimately leading to his death. Therefore, based on the given information, Vehicle 1 (the 2000 Pontiac Grand Am) and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
