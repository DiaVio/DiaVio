The driver of V1 admitted that he was unsure if the load was too heavy for his vehicle at the start of his trip. He soon discovered that the load was indeed too heavy, causing the trailer to fishtail and lose control. This indicates that the driver did not properly assess the weight capacity of his vehicle and trailer before embarking on the journey. Additionally, the driver's attempts to regain control by steering left and right and applying brakes were unsuccessful, resulting in V1 crossing into the southbound lane and colliding with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly load and secure the cargo, as well as driving too fast for the load in tow, are the primary reasons for the accident.
