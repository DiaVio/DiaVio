The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to change lanes to the left without maintaining a safe distance from V2 (2003 Dodge Ram Pick-up) and was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. This resulted in the right side of V1 contacting the left rear bumper of V2, causing V1 to lose control and collide with the Jersey wall, utility pole, and ultimately come to a rest facing southeast.
