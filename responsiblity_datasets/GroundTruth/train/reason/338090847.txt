The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling on a wet road surface and the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve. The wheels/tires broke traction, causing the vehicle to depart from the road and collide with a utility pole. The driver's steering maneuvers contributed to a clockwise rotation, further exacerbating the loss of control. The impact with the utility pole resulted in severe damage to Vehicle 1 and caused the driver to sustain serious injuries.
