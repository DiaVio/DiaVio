The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction (westbound in the eastbound lane) while overtaking another vehicle. Additionally, V2 began to lock up the brakes and attempted to return to the correct lane just before the collision occurred. These actions indicate a clear violation of traffic laws and a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the head-on collision with V1.
