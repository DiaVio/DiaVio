The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling on a roadway covered with slush and ice. Despite being familiar with the road and driving at a speed below the posted limit, the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the counterclockwise rotation and subsequent rollover. The driver's attempt to avoid a collision with the center median by steering left and right further contributed to the loss of control. While the environmental factor of slick roads due to slush and ice played a role in the crash, it was ultimately the driver's actions and inability to maintain control of the vehicle that led to the accident.
