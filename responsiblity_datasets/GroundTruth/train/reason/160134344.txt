The reason for this is that the case occupant, who was driving the 2002 Buick Park Avenue (V1), was utilizing the available seat belt and the steering wheel mounted airbag deployed upon impact. The seat belt and airbag were designed to protect the occupant in the event of a collision. However, despite being restrained, the occupant sustained injuries due to the impact. On the other hand, the driver of the Chevrolet Caprice is not mentioned to have utilized any safety restraints or airbags. Therefore, it can be inferred that the lack of safety measures in V2 contributed to the severity of the collision and the resulting injuries sustained by the case occupant in V1.
