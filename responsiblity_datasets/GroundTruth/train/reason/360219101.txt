The reason for this is that V2 began to decelerate and intended to make a left turn onto the intersecting roadway. V3, the 1999 Ford Explorer compact utility vehicle, braked and steered to the right to avoid a collision with V2. However, V2 was struck by the front of V3, which pushed V2 into the travel lane of Vehicle 1 (V1). As a result, V1 was unable to avoid the collision and impacted the front of V2. Therefore, V2's actions of decelerating and making a left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic led to the chain of events that caused the crash.
