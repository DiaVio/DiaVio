The reason for this is that V1 went through the intersection against the control signal, indicating that they failed to obey the traffic light. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's front impacted the left plane of V2, suggesting that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, which was traveling north in lane four. Furthermore, it is stated that the driver of V1 did not recognize the red traffic light or the presence of V2 coming from their right. This lack of awareness and failure to observe the traffic conditions further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
