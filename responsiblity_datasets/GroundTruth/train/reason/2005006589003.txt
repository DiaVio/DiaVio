The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not paying attention to the road. He stated that he was checking the radio and looked up to see the yellow light, indicating that he was not fully focused on the traffic situation. This recognition error and internal distraction led to V1 running a red light and colliding with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was on medication for blood pressure and depression, which could have potentially impaired his ability to react quickly and make sound judgments while driving. Although V2 was crossing the intersection at the time of the accident, the critical reason for the pre-crash event was not coded to V2. Without further information from the driver of V2, it is difficult to determine if any contributing factors from their side played a role in the accident. Therefore, based on the available information, V1's distraction, failure to obey traffic signals, and potential impairment from medication make them primarily responsible for the accident.
