The reason for this determination is as follows: 1. V1 departed the right side road edge and entered a paved pullout area, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle within the designated travel lane. 2. V1 rotated in a clockwise direction and slid through a soft dirt berm, suggesting that the driver was not able to properly negotiate the curve in the road. 3. V1 fell over the embankment and rolled down a steep canyon, indicating a loss of control and failure to maintain the vehicle on the roadway. 4. The police reported travel speed for V1 was 76 kmph, which exceeds the speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and the advisory speed of 64 kmph (40 mph). This suggests that the driver was traveling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions. 5. The autopsy report revealed positive results for drug and alcohol consumption, with a blood methamphetamine level of 8.1 mg/L and a blood alcohol level of .02%. The presence of these substances in the driver's system indicates impaired judgment and potentially impaired driving ability. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that V1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, excessive speed, and impairment from drug and alcohol consumption.
