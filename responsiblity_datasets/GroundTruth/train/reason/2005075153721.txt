The driver of V1 was distracted by looking at motorcycles to the right, which was identified as an external distraction. This distraction caused V1 to fail to notice that V2 (the 2002 Buick Century Custom sedan) was stopped behind a non-contact vehicle, resulting in the front of V1 colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's driver-related factor of external distraction directly contributed to the accident.
