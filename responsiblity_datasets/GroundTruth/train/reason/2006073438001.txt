The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that she lightly applied the brakes, which resulted in the brakes locking and the vehicle entering a clockwise yaw. This indicates that the driver of V1 made an error in braking, causing the vehicle to lose control and skid across multiple lanes before leaving the roadway and ultimately crashing into the embankment. Additionally, the physical evidence collected at the scene did not support the driver's claim of a brake lock-up on the right side of the vehicle. Instead, there was a skid/yaw mark from the left rear tire, suggesting that the driver's actions were the primary cause of the crash.
