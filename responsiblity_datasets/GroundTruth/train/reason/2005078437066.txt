The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was apparently sleeping while driving, which led to the vehicle running off the left edge of the roadway. Additionally, when the driver woke up, they oversteered the vehicle, causing it to rotate and skid laterally across the westbound lanes. These actions ultimately resulted in the vehicle rolling over and the fatal injuries sustained by the right front occupant.
