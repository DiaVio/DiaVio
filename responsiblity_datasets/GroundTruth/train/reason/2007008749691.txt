The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to seeing the red light and the stopped V2, but was unable to stop in time due to poor directional control. The driver's foot slipping and hitting the accelerator instead of the brakes further indicates a lack of control over the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's fatigue, with the last sleep occurring 21 hours prior to the crash, could have impaired their ability to react and control the vehicle effectively.
