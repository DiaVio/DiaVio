The reason for this is that V1 failed to exercise caution and properly assess the situation before proceeding through the intersection. Despite the sun glare, V1 made the decision to pass through the intersection without wearing sunglasses or taking any other measures to mitigate the effect of the sun glare on their visibility. This lack of precaution resulted in V1 colliding with the left rear of V2, causing the accident. While V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, they had been stopped for over 10 seconds, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear. V2 was following the appropriate traffic rules and was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to exercise caution and properly assess the situation in the presence of sun glare.
