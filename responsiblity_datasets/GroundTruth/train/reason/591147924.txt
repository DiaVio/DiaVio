The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, who was fatigued, allowed the vehicle to drift off the right roadside and onto the level, natural terrain. This indicates a lack of control and attention on the part of the driver, leading to the vehicle tripping on its right wheels and subsequently rolling over multiple times. The driver's fatigue and failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle are the main factors contributing to V1's primary responsibility in this accident.
