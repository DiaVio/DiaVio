The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes to the left without ensuring that it was safe to do so. As a result, V1's vehicle struck the rear of V2 (the Ford E350 van), causing V2 to collide with the rear of V3 (the Kia Rio sedan). V1's failure to properly assess the situation and change lanes safely, combined with the fact that V1 was traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others, indicates that V1 was at fault for the accident.
