The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the red light at the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 was distracted and attempting an illegal maneuver by trying to open a beer while driving. These factors, along with inadequate surveillance (failure to look both ways ahead), contribute to the driver of V2 being primarily responsible for the accident.
