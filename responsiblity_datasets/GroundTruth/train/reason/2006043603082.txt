The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted to pass V2 on the left side while V2 was slowing down to make a left turn. V1 crossed a double yellow line, which is an illegal maneuver, in their attempt to pass V2. This action of overtaking on the left side without ensuring that it was safe to do so resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's false assumption of V2's actions played a role in the crash. V1 stated that they did not see a turn signal on V2 and did not know why it was stopping. However, V2 was in the process of making a left turn, which is a legitimate reason for slowing down. V1's false assumption led them to make a risky maneuver, resulting in the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their illegal maneuver of overtaking on the left side and their false assumption of V2's actions.
