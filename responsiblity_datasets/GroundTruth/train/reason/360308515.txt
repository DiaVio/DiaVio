The driver of V1 moved from lane two to lane one and clipped the west curb with V1's right front tire, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. This action ultimately led to the series of events that resulted in the collision with the concrete planter, metal pole, and wood pole, as well as the subsequent rollover. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane.
