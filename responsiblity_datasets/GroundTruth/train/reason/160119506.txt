The reason for this is that V1 was traveling eastbound in the left turn lane and turned into the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), which was traveling westbound in the left through lane. V2's driver attempted to avoid the crash by steering to the right, but V1's improper turn caused V2 to collide with the right side of V1. This initial impact then caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise until V1's right side struck the left side of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and turning into the path of oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
