The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to inadvertently putting her foot on the accelerator instead of the brake while talking on her cell phone. This driver-related performance error caused V1 to turn right over the center lane line and collide with V2 (the Infiniti M45). V2, on the other hand, was stopped eastbound in lane two and did not have time to attempt any avoidance maneuvers. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's performance error of hitting the accelerator instead of the brake while turning, which resulted in the collision with V2.
