The reason for this is that V1 was turning left from the fifth southbound lane, which means they were making a left turn across multiple lanes of oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the 1997 Toyota 4Runner) was traveling straight in the northbound third travel lane and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and entered the intersection, resulting in a collision with V2. Additionally, there is no information provided to suggest that V2 was at fault or made any errors leading up to the crash. V2 stated that the light was green and did not notice V1 until impact, indicating that V2 was following traffic laws and proceeding through the intersection as expected. Therefore, based on the information given, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn.
