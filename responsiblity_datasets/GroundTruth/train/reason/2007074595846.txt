The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection." This indicates that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a potentially dangerous maneuver. V1, on the other hand, was traveling straight in their lane and had the right of way. Since V2 turned left and struck the front of V1, it suggests that V2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, causing the collision. The fact that V2 left the scene and was not interviewed further adds to their responsibility in the accident. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while making a left turn at the intersection.
