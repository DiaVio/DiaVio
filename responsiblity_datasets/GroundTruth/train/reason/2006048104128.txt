The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see V2 (the Jeep Cherokee) approaching before proceeding across the intersection. Despite the driver's claim of obstructed view due to a building, a tree, and parked vehicles, the scene inspection notes that these objects should not have caused a sightline issue for V2's approach. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately survey the intersection and properly observe the oncoming vehicle led to the collision.
