The reason for this is that V1 failed to see V2 (the Chevrolet Trailblazer) and proceeded straight across the intersection without yielding the right of way. V1's inadequate surveillance and unfamiliarity with the intersection, combined with her obstructed view of crossing traffic, contributed to the collision. While V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and had no chance to take any avoidance actions, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing and yielding to oncoming traffic.
