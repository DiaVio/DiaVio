The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that he waited at the stop sign for five minutes, but failed to notice the approaching V2 due to the obstructed view caused by the shrubbery in the median. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance led to V1 crossing the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2.
