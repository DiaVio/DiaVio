The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction on the freeway, in the left eastbound lane. V1, the 2001 Ford Taurus, was traveling in the correct direction in the left eastbound lane. V1 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering to the left, but V2 still struck the front of V1 in an offset-frontal mode. This indicates that V2 was in the wrong lane and failed to take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
