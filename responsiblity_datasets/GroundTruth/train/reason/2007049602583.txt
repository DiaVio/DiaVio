The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 failed to look or failed to see V2 approaching the intersection, resulting in the collision. V1 proceeded into the intersection after the light turned green without properly checking for oncoming traffic, which led to the impact with V2.
