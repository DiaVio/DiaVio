The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when the white van in front of her slowed down significantly. Instead of maintaining control and braking safely, the driver of V1 hit the brakes and steered to the left abruptly, causing the vehicle to cross multiple lanes of traffic and ultimately collide with the concrete traffic median. This overcompensation led to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
