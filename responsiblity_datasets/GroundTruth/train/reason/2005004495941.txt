The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a combination of factors. The driver's feet were slippery from the armarol cleaner, and his hands were oily from eating a sandwich. These conditions likely contributed to his foot slipping and his hands slipping off the steering wheel while he was straightening out the vehicle. As a result, V1 departed the roadway and struck a tree. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, having had his license for less than 1 year, may have played a role in his inadequate and incorrect evasive actions, such as insufficient steering and braking inputs. Overall, V1's driver's performance error, specifically overcompensation, along with the associated factors of slippery feet, oily hands, and inexperience, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
