The reason for V1's responsibility is that they misjudged the gap and the speed of V2, resulting in V1 turning left in front of V2. V1 stated that she saw V2 but believed she had enough time to make the turn. However, V2 was approaching the intersection and the light was just turning yellow when V1 turned in front of them. V1's misjudgment of the gap and V2's speed led to the collision.
