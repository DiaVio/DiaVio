The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the left side of Vehicle 1, causing it to be redirected and ultimately resulting in multiple subsequent collisions with other parked vehicles, a curb, a small roadway sign, and a building. Vehicle 2's driver also attempted to flee the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
