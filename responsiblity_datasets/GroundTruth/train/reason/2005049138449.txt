The reason for this is that V1 was unable to come to a stop prior to striking the back of V2 (the 1992 Buick Roadmaster), indicating that V1 was following too closely or not paying attention to the traffic ahead. This failure to maintain a safe distance and react in time resulted in the collision with V2, which then caused V2 to strike the back of V3 (the 1997 Ford F-150 pick-up).
