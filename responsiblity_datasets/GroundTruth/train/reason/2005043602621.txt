The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a sharp curve with a cargo and trailer. The driver's inexperience with the area, discomfort with the traffic and trailer load, as well as the road curvature and narrow shoulders, were all contributing factors. Additionally, the driver's panic and failure to control the trailer's swaying and bouncing ultimately led to the crash.
