The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before re-entering the roadway. Despite claiming to have looked both ways, V1 did not see V2 approaching and proceeded to cross all northbound lanes, including the double yellow center road divider, resulting in a collision with V2. Additionally, V1 was distracted while driving, as she was on the phone trying to get directions. This distraction likely contributed to her failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and distracted driving are the main factors that led to the accident, making her primarily responsible.
