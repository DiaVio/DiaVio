The driver of V1 stated that he was in a hurry and was looking at V3 in the rearview mirror, not noticing V2 before the crash. This indicates that the driver of V1 was distracted and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, causing the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factor of external distraction and failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic.
