The reason for V1's responsibility is a misjudgment of gap and velocity while turning left at the intersection. This misjudgment was likely due to the sight line and ride height of the van, which may have made it difficult for the driver to accurately assess the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver's lack of a license and insurance further demonstrates their negligence in operating the vehicle.
