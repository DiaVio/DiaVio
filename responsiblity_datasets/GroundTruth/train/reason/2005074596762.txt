The driver of V1 was engaged in conversation with the right front passenger, causing her to be distracted and not paying attention to the task of driving. This distraction led to her misjudging the gap and speed of the forward traffic, resulting in her sliding into the back of V2 (the dark blue 2003 Ford Explorer). The driver of V1's inattention due to the internal distraction of conversation was the critical reason for the crash.
