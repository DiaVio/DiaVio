The driver of V1 attempted to avoid a collision with a non-contact vehicle by swerving to the right. However, in doing so, the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and crossed over multiple lanes, ultimately colliding with a breakaway pole and tree. The driver's poor directional control and incorrect evasive action contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver's inattention, as he was wondering about his cell phone that he had forgotten at Walmart, further indicates a lack of focus on the road and surroundings. This distraction likely played a role in the driver's inability to safely navigate the situation. Furthermore, the presence of a bald tire on the front left of the vehicle suggests a tire deficiency, which could have compromised the vehicle's handling and stability. Overall, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their incorrect evasive action, poor directional control, inattention, and the presence of a tire deficiency.
