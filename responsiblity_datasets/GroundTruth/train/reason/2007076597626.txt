The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes to the right without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver admitted to looking in her rearview mirror to check for a safe lane change, but when she returned her focus forward, she failed to notice that V2 (the driver of the 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe) had stopped at the intersection. This failure to observe the stopped vehicle and apply the brakes in time to avoid the collision indicates negligence on the part of V1. V2, on the other hand, was following the rules of the road by stopping at the intersection as required. Although V2 stated feeling fatigued, there is no evidence to suggest that this directly contributed to the accident. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the collision.
