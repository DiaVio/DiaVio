The driver of V2 stated that he stopped at the intersection for 5-10 seconds until it was clear, but he failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see) led to the collision with V1 (the Mazda Millenia). Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly observe the intersection before making a left turn.
