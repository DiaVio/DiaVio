The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she looked both ways but did not see V2 until the collision occurred. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming vehicle. Additionally, V1 did not take any avoidance actions, suggesting a lack of awareness and preparedness for the situation. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 Nissan Altima) stated that he tried to steer to the right and hit the brakes to avoid the collision but was unable to do so. This indicates that V2 took appropriate actions to try and prevent the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to take avoidance actions.
