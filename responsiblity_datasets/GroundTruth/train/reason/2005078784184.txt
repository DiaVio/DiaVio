The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they crossed into the intersection when their view was obstructed by the intervening vehicle (the large truck turning right). This indicates a driver decision error on the part of V1, as they failed to properly assess the situation and detect the presence of V2 (the 1998 Mazda pick-up truck) following the large truck. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the intersection conditions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
