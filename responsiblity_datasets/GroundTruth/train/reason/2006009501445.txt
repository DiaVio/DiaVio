The reason for this is that V1 initiated a right turn at the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser) traveling south in lane one. V2 stated that he saw V1 but assumed that V1 would yield the right of way. V2 applied his brakes but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and initiate a right turn without ensuring it was safe to do so makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
