The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they failed to yield to V1, which was an emergency vehicle responding to a call with lights and sirens activated. V2's inadequate surveillance and internal distraction of listening to the stereo at a high volume contributed to their failure to see or hear the approaching ambulance. This resulted in V2 crossing into the intersection and colliding with V1.
