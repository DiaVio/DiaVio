The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection while traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. This resulted in the vehicle fishtailing and ultimately colliding with a power pole. The witness at the scene also confirmed that the driver was trying to beat the light just prior to the crash.
