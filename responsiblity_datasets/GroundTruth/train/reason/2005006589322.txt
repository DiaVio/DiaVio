The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately survey the intersection before making her right turn. Her view was obstructed by parked vehicles on the southeast corner, but she still accelerated into the intersection without ensuring it was clear. This lack of proper surveillance led to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1992 Pontiac Bonneville), who had the right of way. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with both her vehicle and the roadway may have contributed to her inability to properly assess the situation and make a safe turn. Overall, V1's failure to exercise caution and properly survey the intersection before making her turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
