The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. Despite heavy rain and deep running water on the road, the driver was traveling at a speed of 72 kph (45 mph), which exceeded the speed advisory of 80 kph (50 mph). This excessive speed likely contributed to the loss of control of the vehicle, resulting in the counterclockwise rotation and subsequent collisions with the guardrails. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer into the rotation and apply the brakes indicates a lack of proper control and response to the situation. It is the driver's responsibility to adjust their speed and driving behavior according to the prevailing weather conditions, and in this case, the driver failed to do so. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions and failing to maintain control of the vehicle.
