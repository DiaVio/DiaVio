The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the approaching traffic from the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 stated that he waited for more than 10 seconds for a pedestrian to cross the road, but then proceeded with his turn without properly checking for oncoming traffic. This lack of surveillance and inattention to the approaching vehicles led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the 1995 Blue Chevrolet Pickup) was traveling within the speed limit and had the right of way as it was going straight through the intersection. The driver of V2 stated that he saw V1 in his lane when he crested the hill and was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the crash.
