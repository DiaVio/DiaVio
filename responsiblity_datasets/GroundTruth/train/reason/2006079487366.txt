The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to V1's inadequate surveillance. V1 was attempting to change lanes to the left to pass V3 (the unknown large truck) while V2 (the driver of the 2005 Honda Civic) had just changed lanes to the right. V1's failure to adequately surveil the adjacent lane and ensure it was clear before changing lanes resulted in the left side of V1 impacting the right side of V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to safely change lanes is the primary reason for the collision.
