The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related performance error of overcompensation. When the driver encountered two deer on the road, they braked and swerved to the right to avoid them. However, due to the bumpy road conditions, the truck began to bounce and rotate counterclockwise, causing V1 to go off the roadway and collide with a tree. While the driver's attempt to avoid the deer can be considered a successful avoidance maneuver, the subsequent overcompensation and loss of control led to the crash. Additionally, the presence of animals on the roadway and the dark, unlighted conditions of the road are contributing factors, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 and its driver's error in handling the situation.
