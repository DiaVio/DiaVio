The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the fact that V1 stated she looked prior to turning left but did not see V2 approaching. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions, indicating a lack of awareness or response to the situation. It is important to note that V2's critical precrash event was the other vehicle encroachment, suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the accident. However, without further information from the driver of V2, it is difficult to determine if any contributing factors from their side played a role in the collision.
