The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to realize that Vehicle 2 (V2), the bus, was slowing down and misjudged the distance between the two vehicles. As a result, V1 drove into the back of the slower-moving bus while still in the number-one lane, causing a full frontal under-riding impact. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead, leading to the collision.
