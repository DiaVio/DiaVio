The reason for this is that V2 was speeding and lost control while negotiating a right curve. V2 began fishtailing and traveled into the eastbound lane, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle one (V1). The investigating officer estimated V2's speed at impact to be 45 mph, which is above the posted speed limit of 25 mph. Additionally, V2 was driven by a 14-year-old male who was driving without a license, indicating inexperience and a violation of traffic laws. These factors contribute to V2's primary responsibility for the accident.
