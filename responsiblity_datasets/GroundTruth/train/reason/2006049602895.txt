The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the opposite direction's left lane, resulting in the collision with V1 (the 1996 Toyota Camry) as it was turning left at the intersection. V2's encroachment into the left lane of the opposite direction indicates a failure to maintain their lane and a violation of traffic rules.
