The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by conversation with the front passenger and possibly further distracted by the unrestrained children in the vehicle. The driver failed to notice that V2 (the 1981 Ford F-150 pickup) had stopped at the stop sign and began to move forward, assuming that V2 would continue forward. As a result, V1 failed to apply the brakes in time and collided with the rear of V2. Additionally, the fact that V1 had worn-out tires with low tread depth may have contributed to the inability to stop in time. Overall, the distracted driving and failure to maintain a safe following distance make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
