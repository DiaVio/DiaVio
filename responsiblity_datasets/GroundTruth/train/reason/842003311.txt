The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 crossed the centerline into the westbound lane, causing Vehicle 1 (2001 Infiniti QX4 4x4 sport utility vehicle) to take evasive action by steering left. However, Vehicle 2 then steered right in an attempt to re-enter the eastbound lane, resulting in the collision between the front right areas of both vehicles. This indicates that Vehicle 2 was at fault for crossing into the opposing lane and causing the collision.
