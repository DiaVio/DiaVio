The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the westbound lane, which is a risky maneuver. The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the Lincoln LS), resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a significantly slower speed of 16 kmph (10 mph) compared to the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph), which may have contributed to the misjudgment.
