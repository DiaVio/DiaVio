The driver of V1 admitted to dozing off while driving and crossing the centerline, which resulted in the collision with V2. The critical pre-crash event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 was in the wrong lane at the time of the crash. The critical reason for this event was "driver-related factor-sleeping," further confirming that the driver's drowsiness and lack of attention caused the accident. While V2 (the 1996 Jeep Cherokee Sport) did not see V1 until just prior to impact, the driver of V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. The critical pre-crash event coded to V2 was "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over the left lane line," suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's drowsiness and crossing the centerline, while V2 is not primarily responsible as they were not at fault for the collision.
