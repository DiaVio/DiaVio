The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to respond to the unexpected actions of the vehicle ahead of him that stopped for no reason. This caused V1 to lose control of the vehicle, fishtail, and ultimately collide with V2 and V3. The driver of V1 was also cited for speeding and failing to give full time and attention.
