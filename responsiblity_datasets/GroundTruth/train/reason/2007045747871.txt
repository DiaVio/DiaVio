The driver of V1 admitted to not signaling and not taking evasive actions before the impact. The critical reason for the critical event was inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to look and did not see V2 before the collision. Additionally, the driver's emotional state of being in a hurry to get to work and their lack of experience on the roadway contribute to their responsibility for the accident.
