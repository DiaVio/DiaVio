The driver of V1 admitted to drinking beer and being fatigued while driving. These factors likely impaired her judgment and reaction time, leading to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the left side of the roadway. The driver's abrupt steering to the right and subsequent overcompensation caused V1 to rotate and ultimately collide with the concrete wall on the right side of the road. The driver's impaired state, combined with her lack of focus on the road due to thinking about dinner, contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
