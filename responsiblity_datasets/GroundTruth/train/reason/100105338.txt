The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to travel off the roadway and onto the sidewalk, resulting in a collision with a wooden utility pole. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lanes. Additionally, the driver was not using the seat belt restraint, which further contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by both the driver and the front right seat passenger.
