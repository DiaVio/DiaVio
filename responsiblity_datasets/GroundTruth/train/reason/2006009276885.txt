The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the traffic in front of him and collided with V2 (the 1996 Toyota Camry). V1 admitted to being intoxicated and in a hurry, which likely impaired his judgment and reaction time. Additionally, V1 was a first-time driver on this roadway, which suggests a lack of familiarity with the road conditions and traffic patterns. While V2 was adjusting her radio at the time of the crash, it is important to note that V1's failure to stop was the primary cause of the collision. V2 was stopped at the intersection, following the rules of the road, and was struck from behind by V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to his failure to stop and his impaired state.
