The reason for this is that V1 was approaching a stop sign at the intersection and intended to make a left turn. V2 (the driver of the 1997 Ford Escort) was heading straight through the intersection and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to V2 and pulled out in front of them, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," indicating that V1's intended left turn was a contributing factor to the accident. While factors such as wet roadways, rain, and rush hour congestion were present, it is ultimately V1's failure to yield and make a safe left turn that makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
