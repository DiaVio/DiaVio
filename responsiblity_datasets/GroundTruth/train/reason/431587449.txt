The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the right side surface of Vehicle 1 (2004 Toyota 4-Runner) at the intersection, causing Vehicle 1 to rotate clockwise and ultimately roll over. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield or stop at the intersection, resulting in the collision and subsequent rollover of Vehicle 1.
