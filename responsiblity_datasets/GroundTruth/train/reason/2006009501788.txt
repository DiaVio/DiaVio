The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted a sudden lane change into lane one, resulting in the loss of control and departure from the roadway. The driver's incorrect evasive action, braking and steering hard right to avoid a small animal, contributed to the crash. The driver's emotional factors, including extended shifts, a tight delivery schedule, and fatigue, may have impaired their judgment and decision-making abilities. Additionally, the driver's lack of experience with this type of automobile could have further contributed to the inappropriate evasion action taken.
