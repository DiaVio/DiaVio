The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn onto the interstate on-ramp, and according to the critical pre-crash event, V1 failed to yield the right of way. The driver of V1 made a false assumption that V2 (the driver of the Buick LeSabre) would yield the right of way, which led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unlicensed, which further indicates their responsibility in the accident.
