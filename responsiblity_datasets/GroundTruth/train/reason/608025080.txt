The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it crossed the center line and did not alter its path of travel, resulting in a collision with the left side of the front dual wheels of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1998 Kenworth tractor-trailer. This initial impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and be struck again by the front dual wheels of the trailer on its right fender. As a result of this collision, V1 departed the road and came to rest on the roadside facing east-northeast. Although V2 also crossed the center line and briefly traversed the gravel shoulder before regaining control and stopping in the westbound lane, the actions of V1 in not altering its path of travel and causing the initial collision make it primarily responsible for the accident.
