The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, impacting a concrete curb and then a chain link fence before rolling down the embankment. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. The driver was also deemed to be too fast for the wet roadway and curve, which contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver fled the scene, further indicating their responsibility for the accident.
