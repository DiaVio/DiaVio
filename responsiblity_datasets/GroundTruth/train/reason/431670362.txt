The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the occupant of V1 sustained a multitude of complex injuries, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, mesenteric tear, diaphragm rupture, bowel contusions, humeral shaft fracture, radial styloid fracture, rib fractures, ulna fracture, patella fracture, distal femur fracture, intertrochanteric fracture, proximal tibia fracture, and pilon fractures. These injuries indicate that the driver experienced significant impact and movement within the vehicle during the crash, suggesting that V1 was the vehicle that collided with the tree.
