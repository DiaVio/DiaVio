Reason: V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw. The driver of V1 attempted to regain control by steering right, left, and right again, but ultimately lost control and collided with a cement barrier. This loss of control and subsequent rebound into lane one perpendicular to the flow of traffic created a hazardous situation for other vehicles, including V2. Although the slick condition of the roadway may have contributed to the initial loss of control, V1's actions of steering erratically and colliding with the barrier ultimately led to the collision with V2.
