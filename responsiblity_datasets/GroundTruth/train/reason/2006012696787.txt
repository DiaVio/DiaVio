The driver of V1 was engaged in an exterior distraction by looking over his shoulder rearward while changing lanes. This action resulted in inadequate surveillance, as he failed to notice the pedestrian crossing the roadway from left to right. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a speed between 41-50 mph in a 35 mph zone, which is considered traveling too fast. Lastly, the driver's inexperience as a 16-year old may have contributed to his inability to react in time to avoid the collision. While the pedestrian was not crossing at a crosswalk and was wearing all black clothing at night, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to his distracted driving, inadequate surveillance, and excessive speed.
