The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she stopped for the stop sign, looked, and did not see any cars. However, she failed to notice V2 approaching from the northbound roadway. This lack of surveillance and failure to see the oncoming vehicle led to the collision.
