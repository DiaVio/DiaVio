The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to dozing off behind the wheel, which was confirmed by witnesses at the scene. The driver's initial story of the vehicle spinning out of control was found to be not believable, and it was only after receiving citations for the crash that he changed his story and admitted to falling asleep. This driver-related non-performance error of sleeping while driving directly led to the vehicle drifting over several lanes of traffic and ultimately crashing into a tree.
