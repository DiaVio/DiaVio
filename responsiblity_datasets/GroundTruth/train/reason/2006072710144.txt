The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the vehicle in front. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "other motor vehicle traveling in lane: traveling in the same lane while decelerating," suggesting that Vehicle 1 was not able to adjust its speed or react appropriately to the deceleration of Vehicle 2. While the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was coded as "other motor vehicle traveling in lane: traveling in the same direction with higher speed," it is important to note that the critical reason for this event was not coded to Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 2 was not found to have contributed significantly to the cause of the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to its failure to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the deceleration of Vehicle 2.
