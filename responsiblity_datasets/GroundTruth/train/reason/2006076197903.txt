The reason for this is that V1 departed the right road edge and traveled down the embankment, indicating that the vehicle was not properly controlled by the driver. The driver herself stated that she did not know what happened and that the front wheels seemed to go out from underneath her, suggesting a lack of control over the vehicle. Additionally, the witness stated that the Jeep was not driving erratically, indicating that external factors were not the cause of the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors.
