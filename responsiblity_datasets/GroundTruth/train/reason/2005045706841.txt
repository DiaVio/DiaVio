The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed of 55 MPH, which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 25 MPH. - V1 was accelerating rapidly, indicating aggressive driving behavior. - The driver of V1 was distracted internally, which led to a recognition error and a decision error. - The driver of V1 was attempting to "jump" a pothole, which shows a lack of judgment and disregard for road conditions. - The driver of V1 was an inexperienced 16-year old who did not have a license. - The driver of V1 wears contacts for a nearsighted condition, which may have affected their ability to see and react to the road properly. These factors combined demonstrate that V1's actions and behavior were the primary cause of the crash.
