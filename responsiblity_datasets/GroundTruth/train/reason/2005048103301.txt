The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to turn left from the private drive onto the seven-lane roadway, which required yielding to oncoming traffic. V1 failed to yield to V2, which was traveling straight ahead in the northbound lane. Although both drivers had their view obstructed by a large truck in the adjacent lane, it was V1's decision to turn left and impose upon V2's right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and make a safe turn resulted in the collision.
