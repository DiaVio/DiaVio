The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two was making a left turn at the intersection, and the front plane of Vehicle three (2001 Volkswagen Passat) contacted its right plane. This indicates that Vehicle two failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle two admitted to attempting an evasive maneuver to avoid the collision, which resulted in a second impact with Vehicle one (1992 Honda Accord). Therefore, Vehicle two's failure to yield and the subsequent evasive maneuver contribute to its primary responsibility for the collision.
