The reason for this is that V2 collided into the back of V1's trailer, indicating that V2 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, V2's driver admitted to being distracted by something inside his vehicle, specifically looking in his briefcase, which likely contributed to his failure to notice the stopped or slow-moving V1 in front of him. Furthermore, the Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane traveling in same direction with low steady speed," suggesting that V2 had ample opportunity to observe and react to the presence of V1 on the road. In contrast, V1's driver claimed to have pulled out onto the road from a side road and was traveling north when he felt something "dragging." While V1's driver may have been negligent in not noticing V2 approaching from behind, the primary responsibility for the collision lies with V2 for failing to maintain a safe following distance and being distracted while driving.
