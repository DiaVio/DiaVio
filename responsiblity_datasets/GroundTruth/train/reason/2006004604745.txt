The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost consciousness due to a defective arterial stint, resulting in a black-out and loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's physical impairment directly caused the crash, as evidenced by the vehicle drifting off the roadway, striking a mailbox, crossing both lanes of travel, and ultimately colliding with a telephone pole. The driver's inability to act and make avoidance maneuvers prior to the impacts further supports their responsibility for the accident.
