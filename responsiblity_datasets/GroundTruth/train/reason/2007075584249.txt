The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was experiencing a migraine and feeling "out of it" at the time of the crash. This indicates that the driver was not in a proper physical or mental state to operate a vehicle safely. Additionally, V1 admitted to being distracted and daydreaming, which further supports the conclusion that the driver was not paying attention to the road and the traffic conditions. V2 (the driver of the 2002 Jeep Cherokee) was stopped due to traffic, which is a normal occurrence in congested conditions. V2 was not found to have any critical reason or contributing factor that would make them primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's physical condition, distraction, and failure to maintain proper attention while driving.
