The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is as follows: - Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left onto the intersecting side street without adequately surveilling the intersection. - The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he stopped at the intersection and didn't see any other vehicles, but midway through the turn, he saw Vehicle #2 and attempted to accelerate. - Vehicle #1 was charged with driving under the influence, indicating impairment and potential reduced ability to properly assess the situation. - The driver of Vehicle #1 also reported being tired, which could have affected his alertness and reaction time. - Additionally, the roadway geometry (sharp curve) and sightline restriction (tree line) were coded as associated factors, potentially contributing to the driver's inadequate surveillance. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection while attempting to make a left turn.
