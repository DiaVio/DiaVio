The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking in all three mirrors after hearing the sirens of an emergency vehicle. Instead of focusing on the road ahead, V1 failed to notice that V2 (the Lincoln Navigator) had stopped in front of her. This distraction caused V1 to collide with the back of V2. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1 had underinflated tires and low tread depth, which could have contributed to reduced braking efficiency and increased stopping distance. Overall, V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road ahead are the main factors that make her primarily responsible for the accident.
