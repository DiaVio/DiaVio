The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they turned left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The sight line was obstructed by vehicle traffic backed up in the first two lanes of the cross street. V1 failed to ensure that it was safe to make the left turn and did not see V2 approaching before initiating the turn. This failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within the designated center turn lane at a reasonable speed and did not have any contributing factors that would make them primarily responsible for the accident.
