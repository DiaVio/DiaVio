The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle. The driver admitted to looking to the right to check for clearance to change lanes, which caused her to miss the tire tread in her lane. When she looked forward again, she overcompensated by abruptly steering right, leading to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the curb, reflector post, bushes, and chain link fence. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and poor directional control were associated factors in the crash. The driver was described as rarely driving this route and being in a hurry to get to church on time. These factors likely contributed to her inability to effectively respond to the object in the roadway and maintain control of the vehicle.
