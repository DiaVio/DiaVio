The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that she did not see V2 until she was already in the intersection. Inadequate surveillance is a driver-related factor that indicates a failure to properly observe and assess the traffic conditions before making a maneuver. Additionally, V1's left turn across oncoming traffic was a critical pre-crash event, indicating that V1 was attempting a maneuver that required yielding to oncoming traffic. The collision occurred when V2 (the 2002 Toyota Tacoma pickup) was traveling straight in the westbound lane and V1's right plane was contacted by the front plane of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
