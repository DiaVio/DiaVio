The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Plymouth Breeze) who was stopped in front of V1 to turn left. V1's pre-impact skid mark of 56 meters (184 feet) indicates that the driver was traveling at a high speed and failed to realize that V2 was stopped in front of them in the travel lane. Additionally, factors such as inattention, emotional issues, and inadequate surveillance were also identified as contributing factors for V1. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as another motor vehicle in the lane traveling in the same direction with a higher speed. However, the critical reason was not coded to V2, indicating that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their excessive speed and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them.
