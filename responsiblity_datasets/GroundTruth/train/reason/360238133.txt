The reason for this is that V2 was southbound and negotiating a curve to the right, but instead of following the curve, it continued straight and crossed the centerline into the northbound lane. This action resulted in a head-on collision with V1, the 2008 Cadillac CTS four door sedan. V2's failure to negotiate the curve and crossing into the opposite lane directly caused the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
