The driver of V1 admitted to drinking before starting his trip, which impaired his ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle. This, combined with his excessive speed, led to him losing control of the vehicle and veering off the roadway. The presence of alcohol and the driver's poor directional control were the critical reasons for the crash.
