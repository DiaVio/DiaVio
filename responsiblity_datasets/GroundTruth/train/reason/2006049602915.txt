The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, but failed to see V2 (the driver of the 2006 Infinity M45) approaching from the opposite direction. V1's line of sight was obstructed by the stopped traffic in the northbound lanes, but it was still her responsibility to ensure that it was safe to make the turn. Additionally, V1 did not have a driver's license at all, which further indicates a lack of experience and knowledge of traffic rules and regulations. While V2 was driving illegally in the bus lane, this does not absolve V1 of her responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic when making a left turn. V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the accident.
