The reason for V1's responsibility is that it traveled off the right side of the roadway, resulting in the left side striking a metal pole. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the collision with the pole. Since the driver's error is unknown, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the incident, but the driver's failure to stay on the road suggests negligence or a mistake on their part.
