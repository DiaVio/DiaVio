The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions, specifically the icy roadway. The driver noticed the icy conditions and attempted to brake intermittently, but was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that the right rear tire was inflated to a pressure less than 1/2 the PSI of the other 3 tires may have contributed to the loss of control. It is also worth noting that the driver was not using the ABS feature, which is designed to work in such conditions to help maintain control of the vehicle. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle on the icy roadway, as well as the potential contributing factors of the underinflated tire and not utilizing the ABS feature.
