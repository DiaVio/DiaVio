The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to standing water on the roadway. This indicates that the driver was not able to maintain control of the vehicle under the prevailing road conditions, which ultimately led to the crash. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash, which further suggests a lack of responsibility and adherence to safety measures.
