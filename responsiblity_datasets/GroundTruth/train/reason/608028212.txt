The reason for this is that the case vehicle drifted off the south edge of the road, indicating a loss of control by the driver. This resulted in the vehicle going down the embankment and striking a culvert with its undercarriage and front end. The fact that the trailer became unhitched suggests that the vehicle was not being properly controlled or operated within safe parameters. Additionally, the driver sustained serious injuries, indicating a failure to exercise proper caution and control while operating the vehicle.
