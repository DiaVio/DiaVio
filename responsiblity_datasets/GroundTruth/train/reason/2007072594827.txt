The reason for this is that V2 was leaving a driveway and turning left onto the north/south roadway. The driver of V2 stated that he looked left before entering the roadway but never saw V1 (the Chevrolet Cavalier) prior to the crash. This indicates that V2 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making the left turn, which is a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V2 had only been driving a truck for six months, indicating inexperience as an associated factor in the crash.
