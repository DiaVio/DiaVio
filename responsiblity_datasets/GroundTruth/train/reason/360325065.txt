The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it drifted to the right over the shoulder and departed the roadway into a shallow ditch. It then continued straight in the ditch and impacted a slight embankment of a drainage ditch with boulders. This impact caused V1 to lift upward and roll to the left into an open grassy area, ultimately resulting in the rollover and the vehicle coming to rest on its left side. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V1, who was the only vehicle occupant and sustained moderate severity injuries, led to the rollover collision.
