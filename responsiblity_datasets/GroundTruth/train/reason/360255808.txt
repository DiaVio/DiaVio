The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was the vehicle that lost control and departed the roadway. V1 started to rotate counterclockwise while negotiating the curve on the gravel road, causing it to slide and eventually impact and swipe down the embankment. The front right tire then dug into the dirt, tripping V1 and causing it to roll over multiple times before coming to rest off the roadway.
