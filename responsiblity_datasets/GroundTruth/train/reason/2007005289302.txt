The reason for this is that V1 lost control of their vehicle while negotiating the right curve on the roadway. This indicates that they were driving at a speed that was too fast for the curve, which is the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the presence of alcohol as an associated factor suggests that impaired driving may have contributed to the loss of control. It is important to note that the lack of an interview with the driver of V1 makes it uncertain if any fatigue or health-related issues also played a role in the crash. However, based on the available information, V1's excessive speed and potential impairment are the primary factors leading to their responsibility for the accident.
