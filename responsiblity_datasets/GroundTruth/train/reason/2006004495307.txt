The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Precrash Event and associated factors. The driver attempted a left-hand turn without slowing down, resulting in a loss of traction and the vehicle starting to yaw right. This ultimately led to V1 rolling over and colliding with a tree. Additionally, the driver's inattention due to conversing with passengers, poor directional control, and driver inexperience (having only been driving for 18 months) were contributing factors to the crash. Furthermore, the tire/wheel deficiency, specifically the excessive tread wear, may have also played a role in the loss of control of V1. Overall, the driver's decision to travel too fast for the turn, combined with other factors such as inattention and inexperience, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
