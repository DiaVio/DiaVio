The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she misjudged the distance of V2 when she decided to make her left turn. This is supported by her statement that she thought V2 was far away because it was coming over the crest of a hill. Additionally, the crash history report reveals that V1 was involved in a similar crash scenario at the same intersection four years earlier, with the critical reason being "misjudgment of gap or other's speed." While V2 (the driver of the 2000 Ford Taurus SE) did switch lanes before the collision, it is stated that V1 had already completed her turn and was about to enter the hospital when the collision occurred. This suggests that V1 had the right of way and V2 encroached into her path. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her misjudgment of the distance of V2 when making her left turn.
