The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to not stopping at the stop sign and proceeding with the left turn without properly checking for oncoming traffic. This driver error of inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the high voltage power box and large shrubs further obstructed the driver's view of V2. The driver's inexperience, ADD, and unknown seizure disorder may have also contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the situation and make a safe turn. On the other hand, the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by changing lanes and accelerating, indicating that they took appropriate evasive action. The driver of V2 also claimed that V1 did not brake or slow down prior to entering the intersection, suggesting that V1's failure to yield the right of way was a significant factor in the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign, inadequate surveillance, and the sightline restriction caused by the power box and shrubs.
