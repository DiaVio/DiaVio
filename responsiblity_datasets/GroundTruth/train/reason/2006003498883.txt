The driver of V2 admitted to performing a rolling stop at the intersection, indicating a failure to fully comply with traffic laws. Additionally, the driver stated that he looked but did not see V1, suggesting inadequate surveillance. The driver's urgency in responding to a fire alarm may have also contributed to a lack of attention and awareness of other vehicles on the road. While V1 (the Chrysler 300C) was cited for inadequate surveillance as well, it is important to note that V2, as an emergency vehicle with lights and sirens activated, had the right of way and should have been given priority by other drivers. V1's failure to yield to the emergency vehicle further supports V2's primary responsibility for the crash. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to a combination of inadequate surveillance, failure to fully stop at the intersection, and the urgency of responding to a fire alarm.
