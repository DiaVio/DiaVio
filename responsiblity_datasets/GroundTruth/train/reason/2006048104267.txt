The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was inattentive (daydreaming) and failed to notice that V2 and V3 were stopped in eastbound traffic. This inattention led to V1 striking the rear of V2, which then caused V2 to strike the rear of V3. Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention to the road and the stopped vehicles ahead resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
