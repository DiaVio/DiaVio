The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that it failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle #2 (1998 GMC 3500 pickup truck) and collided with the back of Vehicle #2. This is evident from the statement of the driver of Vehicle #1, who mentioned that Vehicle #2 was either stopped or going very slow to turn, and she did not have enough time to stop. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was found to have a recognition error - inattention, which is a critical reason for the pre-crash event. The driver's fatigue, as indicated by her statement of being "dead tired" and in need of a bed, could have contributed to her inattention. Furthermore, Vehicle #1 was traveling too closely to Vehicle #2, which is a contributory factor in the accident. This suggests that Vehicle #1 did not maintain a safe following distance, which is essential for avoiding rear-end collisions. In contrast, Vehicle #2 was slowing down considerably due to the steep grade of the intersecting road and the driver's lack of experience with the new truck. However, these factors alone do not make Vehicle #2 primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the given information, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to maintain a safe distance and the driver's recognition error and inattention.
