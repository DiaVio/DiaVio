The witness stated that V2 did not stop at the stop sign, which indicates a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for the driver of V2 was "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path", suggesting that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. The fact that V2 was also taking medication for high blood pressure, which could potentially affect her driving abilities, further supports the conclusion that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
