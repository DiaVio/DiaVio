The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection." Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; external distraction." This indicates that V1 was distracted while making a left turn at the intersection, which led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was "not coded to this vehicle." This suggests that V2's actions were not a significant contributing factor to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving while making a left turn at the intersection.
