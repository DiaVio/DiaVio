The driver of V2 reported that she saw V1 (the 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee) as she approached the intersection and assumed that V1 would remain stopped as she passed through. However, when V1 began to move, the driver of V2 was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
