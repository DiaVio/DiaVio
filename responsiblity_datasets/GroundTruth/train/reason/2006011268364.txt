The driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to several factors. Firstly, the driver was inexperienced, being only 16 years old. Secondly, the driver failed to exercise proper control of the vehicle, as evidenced by the poor directional control leading to the vehicle veering off the road. Additionally, the driver's actions of taking her eyes off the road to adjust the radio further contributed to the accident. These factors, combined with the wet road conditions and standing water, ultimately led to the collision with the tree and the injuries sustained by the passengers.
