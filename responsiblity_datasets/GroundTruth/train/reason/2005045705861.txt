The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was turning left across the southbound lanes of the arterial roadway, intending to enter a private lot on the west side. Vehicle 2 (the 1989 Toyota Corolla) was traveling southbound in the right lane and collided with the right side of Vehicle 1 as it crossed the lanes. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event for Vehicle 1 was a decision error, specifically a misjudgment of the gap or others' speed. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 made an error in assessing the distance and speed of Vehicle 2, leading to the collision. While there are some contributing factors related to the driver of Vehicle 2, such as being on medication for thyroid, depression, and high blood pressure, these factors do not appear to directly contribute to the cause of the crash. The primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 1 for failing to yield and misjudging the gap or others' speed.
