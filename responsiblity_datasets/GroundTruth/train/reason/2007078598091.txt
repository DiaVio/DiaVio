The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to V2 (the 1996 Geo Prizm) and was unable to respond to V2's deceleration in time to avoid the crash. This is indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as a driver-related factor for V1, specifically "following too close to respond to unexpected actions." While V2 was also involved in the accident and was slowing down for the vehicles in front of it, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the situation.
