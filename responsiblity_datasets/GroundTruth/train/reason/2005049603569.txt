The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they encroached over the left lane line, which resulted in the collision with V1. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 was finishing a phone call and still holding the phone in her right hand, which suggests a potential distraction. The limited line of sight due to a large pine tree further contributed to the driver's inability to see V1 and avoid the collision.
