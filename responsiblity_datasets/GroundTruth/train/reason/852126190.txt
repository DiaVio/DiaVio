The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the seat belt extender used by the occupant allowed the body to buckle over the belt, resulting in inappropriate positioning of the seat belt. This inappropriate positioning contributed to the chest injuries sustained by the occupant, including multiple left-sided rib fractures and bilateral pulmonary contusions. Additionally, the head injury was caused by the impact of the seat back, which indicates that the occupant was not properly restrained by the seat belt. The use of a seat belt extender, combined with the occupant's age, further contributed to the severity of the injuries, particularly the high number of rib fractures.
