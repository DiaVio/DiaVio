The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not notice that V2 and V3 had come to a stop in lane two. This lack of attention and failure to react in time resulted in V1 skidding into the rear of V2, causing the subsequent collision with V3. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to react in time to the stopped vehicles ahead.
