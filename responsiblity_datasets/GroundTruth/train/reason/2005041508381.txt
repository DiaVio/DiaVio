The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to see the six-inch pipe lying across lane two, which caused her to hit it with her left front tire. Additionally, she did not see the Nissan 300ZX in lane one and made contact with its left side. V1's failure to notice the pipe and the presence of another vehicle in her vicinity contributed to the accident.
