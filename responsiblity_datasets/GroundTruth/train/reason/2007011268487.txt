The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to the truck (V2) and was unable to stop in time when the truck suddenly stopped. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at the clock, which contributed to his delayed reaction in braking. While V2 did make an illegal maneuver by entering a "No truck" zone and was unfamiliar with the area, these factors alone do not make V2 primarily responsible for the accident. The main cause of the collision was V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and being distracted while driving.
