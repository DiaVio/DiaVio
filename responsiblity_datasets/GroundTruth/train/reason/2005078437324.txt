The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn across the eastbound lanes without properly observing the continuous left turn lane where V2 (the driver of the 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS) was traveling. V1 stated that she did not see V2 approaching in the left turn lane, indicating a failure to yield the right of way. Additionally, V1's line of sight was obstructed by vehicles stopped in the eastbound lanes, which further contributed to the driver's failure to see V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and failure to properly observe the left turn lane, combined with the obstructed line of sight, make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
