The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a left turn at the intersection with an obstructed view. Despite feeling rested and being familiar with the roadway, the driver of V1 stated that they were uncomfortable with the surrounding traffic. This discomfort may have contributed to the driver's decision to turn left without a clear view, resulting in the collision with V2.
