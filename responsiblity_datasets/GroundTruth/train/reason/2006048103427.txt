The driver of V1 was attempting to turn left at the intersection, and the critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver-related factor: turned with obstructed view. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not have a clear view of the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Although V2 (the driver of the 1999 Pontiac Grand Prix sedan) was involved in the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 was already in the intersection and turning into the opposite direction when the collision occurred. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to ensure a clear view before making the left turn.
