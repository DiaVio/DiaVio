The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to having a habit of turning left at the intersection without checking if it is clear, even when her signal is green. Additionally, she was distracted and lost in thought about a book character, indicating a lack of attention to the road. This inattention and failure to properly assess the situation led to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the Ford Focus) had the right of way and was traveling straight in her lane when V1 turned left in front of her. V2 attempted to avoid the crash by steering right and applying the brakes, but there was not enough time or space to prevent the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and her inattention while turning left make her primarily responsible for the accident.
