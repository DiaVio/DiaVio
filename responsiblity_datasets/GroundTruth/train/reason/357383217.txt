The reason for this is that the injuries sustained by the driver, such as the skull fracture, subgaleal hematoma, mandible fractures, contusions to the cerebellum and cerebrum, transection of the pontomedullary junction and basilar artery, as well as the various abrasions and fractures, are all possibly or probably due to contact with the right instrument panel, right-front door, and other parts of the vehicle interior. These injuries suggest that the driver's movement during the severe frontal impact caused him to come into contact with various parts of the vehicle, indicating that he was not properly restrained or protected by the safety features of the car. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of Vehicle 1.
