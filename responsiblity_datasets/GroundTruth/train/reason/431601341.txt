The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound in the straight inboard lane, and it impacted the right side of V1 (the 2012 four-door Nissan Sentra) as both vehicles entered the intersection. The impact from V2 caused V1 to rotate clockwise and travel off the roadway, resulting in serious injuries to the front right occupant of V1.
