The reason for Vehicle 1's responsibility is that it was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others, specifically Vehicle 2 (the 2004 Toyota Camry) decelerating to a stop to avoid stopped traffic ahead. Vehicle 1's inability to stop in time and sliding into the back of Vehicle 2 indicates that it was not maintaining a safe following distance and/or was not adjusting its speed appropriately for the road conditions (rain) and the actions of other vehicles.
