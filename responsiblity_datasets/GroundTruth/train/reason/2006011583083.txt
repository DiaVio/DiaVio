The reason for this is that V1 attempted to rejoin the westbound traffic by cutting in front of V2 (the 2005 Pontiac Vibe) without giving enough room for V2 to stop. This illegal maneuver by the driver of V1 caused the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, factors such as traveling too fast for conditions, misjudgment of the speed of V2, and proceeding with insufficient clearance contribute to the responsibility of V1 for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
