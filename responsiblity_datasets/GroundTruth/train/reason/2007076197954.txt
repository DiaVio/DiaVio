V2 lost control of the vehicle on the slick roadway due to a patch of black ice, which initiated the control loss. V2 was driving at a reduced speed and attempting to drive in a safe manner, but was unable to avoid the impact with V1. Therefore, V2's loss of control on the icy patch of road is the main reason for the accident.
