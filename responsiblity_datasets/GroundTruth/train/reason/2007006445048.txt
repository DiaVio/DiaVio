The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection on a red light, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by talking on her cell phone and adjusting her car radio, which contributed to her failure to see V1 until the last minute. These actions demonstrate a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V2, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
