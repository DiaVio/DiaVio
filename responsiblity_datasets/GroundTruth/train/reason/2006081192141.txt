The reason for V1's responsibility is that they entered the intersection on a red traffic light, which is a violation of traffic laws. This action resulted in the front of V1 striking the left side of V2 (the 2001 Dodge Neon) as V2 was already in the intersection and had the right of way to make a left turn. V1's failure to stop at the red light and yield to oncoming traffic from V2 demonstrates their negligence and disregard for traffic regulations, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
