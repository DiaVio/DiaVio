The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, crossed the right parking lane line, and struck V2 (the parked BMW). The investigation concluded that there was no vehicle failure, but rather an unknown driver error that caused V1 to depart its lane and collide with V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side, indicating a driver-related factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's loss of control and failure to maintain their lane.
