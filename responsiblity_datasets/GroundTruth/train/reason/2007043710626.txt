The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling straight through the intersection. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V2 is listed as "Type of driver error unknown" due to the lack of interview. However, it is important to note that V2's medical report indicates that she suffers from hypothyroidism and takes prescription medications, which could potentially have an impact on her driving abilities. Overall, based on the information provided, V2's failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
