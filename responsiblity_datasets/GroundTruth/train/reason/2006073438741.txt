The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by trying to dial her cell phone and was not paying attention to the traffic in front of her. She admitted that the light coming into the vehicle was too bright for her to see the display, so she held the phone down by her side and proceeded to dial. When she looked up, she realized that traffic had stopped, but it was too late for her to stop in time, resulting in the collision with the rear of V2. V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her led to the crash, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
