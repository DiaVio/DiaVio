The reason for this is that V2, being the dominant vehicle, impacted the left side of V1, pushing it laterally into the northwest corner of the intersection. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 was swerving to the left and braking just prior to and during the post-impact, indicating that V2 may have been at fault for not maintaining control or failing to yield the right of way.
