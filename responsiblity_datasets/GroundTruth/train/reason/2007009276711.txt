The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She admitted to not checking to see if it was safe to proceed and instead was distracted by looking at street signs. This lack of surveillance and failure to ensure the intersection was clear before initiating the left turn led to the collision with V2 (the 2003 Volkswagen GTI). While V2 reported having the green light and attempting to brake to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to her inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
