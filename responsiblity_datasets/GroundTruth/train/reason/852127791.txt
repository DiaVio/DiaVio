The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the right and swiped the right side down the guard rail, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. V1 then moved left and crossed over both lanes on the east shoulder, further demonstrating a lack of control. Finally, V1 contacted the front left corner into the east side guard rail, causing the vehicle to roll forward and come to rest facing south on the east shoulder. The driver of V1, a 40-year-old female, sustained serious injuries, suggesting that the accident was a result of her actions or negligence.
