The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that she began inching out into the intersection and assumed that V2 would stop when the light turned yellow. However, V2 proceeded through the intersection, resulting in the collision. V1's false assumption and failure to properly assess the situation led to the accident. Additionally, V1's estimated travel and impact speeds were significantly lower than V2's, indicating that V1 may not have been fully aware of the oncoming vehicle's speed and distance. It is important to note that V1 was also taking several medications for depression at the time of the crash, which could have potentially affected her judgment and perception of the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her false assumption of V2's actions and failure to exercise caution while turning left at the intersection.
