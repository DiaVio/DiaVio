The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver of V1 departed the eastbound travel lane to the right for an unknown reason. This initial departure from the lane indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's subsequent overcorrection and crossing of the westbound lane further demonstrates a lack of control and potentially reckless driving behavior. These actions ultimately led to the multiple impacts and the rollover of V1.
