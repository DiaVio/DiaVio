The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1994 Ford Windstar van). This is supported by the witness statement in the police report, which indicates that V1 did not stop for the posted stop sign. Additionally, the critical precrash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," further indicating that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2 is the primary reason for the crash.
