The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to realize they had a red light and proceeded through the intersection. This indicates a violation of traffic laws and a failure to adhere to the traffic signal. V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier) had a green light and was proceeding through the intersection correctly. V1's failure to stop for the red light and their inadequate surveillance in not seeing V2 before impact contributed to the accident.
