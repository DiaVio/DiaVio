The reason for V1's responsibility is that she made an illegal U-turn across the third Westbound lane without adequate surveillance and judgment of the surrounding traffic. Her attention was distracted by focusing on her cousin's vehicle traveling in the opposite direction, leading to a false assumption that the other driver would yield the right-of-way. This decision error and false assumption ultimately resulted in the collision with V2 (the driver of the Nissan Maxima sedan).
