The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to realize that the shadow approaching the vehicle was an elk and made no attempts to avoid it as it approached her vehicle. This is considered inadequate evasive action, as the driver did not brake and steer to avoid the collision. Additionally, it was dark at the time of the crash, and the roadway was not illuminated by street lights, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to identify the approaching elk in time to take appropriate action.
