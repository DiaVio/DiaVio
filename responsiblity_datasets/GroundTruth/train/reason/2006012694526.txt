The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to note the traffic signal turning red and entered the intersection. The driver admitted that his thoughts were not on his driving at the time of the crash, as he was thinking about his class and job. This indicates a lack of attention and focus on the road, which led to V1 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so.
