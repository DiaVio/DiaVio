The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (60 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). This indicates that the driver was driving at an unsafe speed for the road conditions. Additionally, the driver was distracted by a phone call, which was described as an argument, and this distraction likely contributed to his inattention and loss of control of the vehicle. Furthermore, the driver's state of anger and frustration due to being late for work and having to turn around to deliver something to his wife may have impaired his judgment and decision-making abilities, making him more prone to making errors while driving. Overall, the driver's excessive speed, distraction, and emotional state all played a significant role in causing the crash. Therefore, V1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
