The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver (D1) experienced a critical non-performance event by traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. D1 stated that he felt dizzy or something before the crash, and he also mentioned taking heart and seizure medication, as well as experiencing a memory lapse prior to the crash. These factors indicate that D1's physical condition or medication may have impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle, leading to the departure from the road and subsequent collision with a tree.
