The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to pass another vehicle and changed lanes into lane two, resulting in the front of V1 contacting the front of Vehicle two (V2), the 1997 Honda Accord sedan. This lane change and failure to yield to oncoming traffic caused the collision.
