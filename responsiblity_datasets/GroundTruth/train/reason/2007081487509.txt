The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was engaged in multiple driver-related factors that contributed to the crash. These factors include overcompensation, internal distraction (changing the radio station), fatigue, and the influence of medications (Fentanyl and Xanax). These factors likely impaired the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the departure from the roadway, crossing all lanes, and ultimately the rollover.
