The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic before turning. The driver of V2 admitted that she looked over her left shoulder but did not see V1 (the Chevy Camaro) until she started to turn or change lanes. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the approaching vehicle, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2 was assigned the associated factor of an illegal maneuver, as it turned from the wrong lane. Therefore, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
