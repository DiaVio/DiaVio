The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and crossed over the left lane line due to an internal distraction. The driver admitted to reaching over to the passenger seat to get her cell phone, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and collide with V2 (the 2004 International medium heavy truck). Additionally, the driver's inexperience with the roadway and feeling uncomfortable further contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. V2, on the other hand, was not coded with any critical reason or associated factors that would indicate responsibility for the crash. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
