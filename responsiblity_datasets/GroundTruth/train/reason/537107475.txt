The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to recognize the lower speed of V1 (the 2004 Pontiac Grand Am) in front of them and was unable to avoid a collision. Despite attempting to brake, V2 still struck the rear of V1, causing a chain reaction collision with V3 (the 2002 Oldsmobile Aurora). Therefore, the driver of V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
