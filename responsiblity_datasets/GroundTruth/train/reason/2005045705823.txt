The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 ran a red light and struck Vehicle #2 in the right side. The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by arguing with her son and looking at him while driving. She also stated that she did not see that the light was red as she approached the intersection. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was in a hurry to get to the hospital due to a potential heart problem and was upset by the ongoing argument with her passenger. These factors, along with the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway and possible side effects of the medication she was taking, contributed to her recognition error and illegal maneuver of running the red light.
