The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and crossed into the eastbound left turn lane, ultimately colliding with V2 (the 1994 GMC garbage truck) that was already stopped in the left turn lane. V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly navigate the intersection led to the collision.
