The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to turn left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. It is not determined if V1 stopped at the stop sign before proceeding into the intersection, but regardless, V1 failed to yield to V2 (the driver of the 2006 Ford Crown Victoria) who was traveling straight in the second travel lane of the northbound roadway. V2 stated that she never saw the other vehicle coming, indicating that V1 may have entered the intersection without sufficient caution or failed to properly signal their intention to turn. This lack of awareness or failure to follow proper turning procedures by V1 led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their involvement in a turning maneuver without ensuring it was safe to do so.
