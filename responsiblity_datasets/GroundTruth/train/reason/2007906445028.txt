The reason for this is that V2 driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. Despite having the green light, V2 driver acknowledged that he was aware of the stopped traffic to his left in lanes two and three and should have realized that caution was required. This failure to properly observe the intersection and anticipate potential hazards led to the collision with V1.
