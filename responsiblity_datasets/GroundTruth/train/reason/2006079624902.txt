The driver of V1 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver caused V1 to enter the intersection and collide with V2 (the 1995 Mitsubishi Montero). V2 was traveling within its designated lane and did not contribute to the cause of the accident.
