The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in lane two of the primary road and had just entered the intersection on a green light when V1, traveling east in lane two of the secondary road, passed into the intersection on a red light. V2 had the right of way and was proceeding legally through the intersection when V1 entered against the traffic signal. V2 was unable to avoid the collision with V1, resulting in the subsequent collision with V3. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and yield the right of way.
