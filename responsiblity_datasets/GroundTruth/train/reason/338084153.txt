The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the road and penetrated a wooded area, ultimately colliding with multiple trees. The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed it to continue towards the right pavement edge, resulting in the initial impact with a large diameter tree. This impact caused moderate damage to the vehicle. Furthermore, Vehicle 1 rotated sharply clockwise and struck an adjacent small diameter tree, causing additional moderate damage. This rotation tipped the vehicle's center of gravity outboard of its wheels, initiating a left side rollover. During the rollover, the vehicle's left rear side impacted a third large diameter tree, resulting in severe non-horizontal damage. The lack of restraint use by both the 17-year-old female driver (case occupant 1) and the 18-year-old female rear center passenger (case occupant 2) of Vehicle 1 also contributed to the severity of their injuries. The absence of loading marks on the available seat belts and the vehicle's Event Data Recorder (EDR) reporting the driver's belt switch circuit status as "unbuckled" indicate that the occupants were not wearing their seat belts at the time of the accident. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's actions and the lack of restraint use by the occupants.
