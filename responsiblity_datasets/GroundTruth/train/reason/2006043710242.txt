The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 experienced a heart attack or other physical impairment that caused her to black out while driving. This critical non-performance error led to V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side and ultimately overturning in the ditch. The driver's physical conditions of chronic mitral regurgitation and cervical spondylolysis, along with her admission of moderate pain, further support the likelihood of a physical impairment contributing to the crash.
