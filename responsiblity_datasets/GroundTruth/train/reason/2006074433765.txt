The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes into lane two without noticing that the other vehicles had stopped. The driver admitted to being distracted by looking down at the odometer, which caused her to not pay attention to the traffic ahead. As a result, V1 collided with the back of V2, setting off a chain reaction of collisions with the other vehicles. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and not being attentive to the traffic ahead led to the accident.
