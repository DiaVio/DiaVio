The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by a woman honking her horn and tailgating him. Instead of focusing on the oncoming traffic while making a left turn, V1's attention was on the woman behind him. This distraction caused V1 to fail to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
