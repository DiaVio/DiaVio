The driver of V1 reported that he did not see V2 (the 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass) until the last minute and did not expect a car to be stopped in his lane ahead of him. This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway and had a sight restriction due to the non-contact vehicle that swerved to the right at the last moment. These factors contribute to the driver's failure to recognize and react to the stopped vehicle in front of him, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and lack of awareness of the stopped vehicle in his lane.
