The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver did not anticipate that the bus and V2 would be stopped in lane one, and when he finally noticed them, he slammed on his brakes and skidded into V2. Additionally, the driver's lack of experience, having only been driving for 2 months, may have contributed to his inability to react in time to avoid the collision.
