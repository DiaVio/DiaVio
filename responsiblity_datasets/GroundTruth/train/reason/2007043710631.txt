Reason: V1 failed to stop for the red light and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 likely wasn't paying attention, as indicated by her failure to make any avoidance maneuvers and her vehicle's under-inflated tires. Additionally, the witness for V1 mistakenly believed that her light was green when she entered the intersection, possibly due to the presence of a green right turn arrow for eastbound traffic.
