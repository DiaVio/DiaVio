The reason for V1's responsibility is that the tie rod on the right front wheel broke, leading to a loss of vehicle control. This disabling vehicle failure directly caused the crash. The driver's distraction from reading a map at the time of the crash may have contributed to the severity of the accident, but the primary cause was the vehicle-related factor of the suspension failure.
