The driver of V1 was cited for running a red light, which indicates a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident was coded to V1 as an illegal maneuver. The driver of V1 failed to stop at the red light and collided with V2 (the black 1998 Nissan Sentra) that was lawfully proceeding through the intersection after the light turned green. Therefore, V1's failure to obey traffic signals and engage in an illegal maneuver makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
