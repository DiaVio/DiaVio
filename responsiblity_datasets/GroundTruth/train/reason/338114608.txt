The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it was the vehicle that traveled partially off the roadway to the right, re-entered the roadway, crossed both travel lanes, and ultimately impacted a mailbox post and a concrete culvert in a ditch. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
