The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the GMC Sonoma) when she attempted to turn left at the intersection. Despite seeing V2 approaching, V1 thought she had enough time to make the turn, but she did not. This misjudgment led to V1 turning in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1's medical conditions of anxiety and thyroid disorder, along with the use of prescription medications to treat these conditions, may have contributed to her misjudgment and decision-making abilities. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield the right-of-way to V2 make her primarily responsible for the accident.
