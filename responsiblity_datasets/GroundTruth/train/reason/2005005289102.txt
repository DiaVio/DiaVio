The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were making a left turn at the intersection without a green arrow, which means they were required to yield to oncoming traffic. V1 did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2) until the last second and did not take any avoidance actions. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that V1 looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle.
