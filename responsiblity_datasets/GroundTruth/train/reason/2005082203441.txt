The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and struck the rear of V2, pushing it into V3. The driver of V1 was not familiar with the vehicle and was not wearing proper footwear, which led to a performance error. Specifically, the driver's sandal got caught on the pedal, preventing them from properly engaging the brakes. This driver-related factor contributed to the collision.
