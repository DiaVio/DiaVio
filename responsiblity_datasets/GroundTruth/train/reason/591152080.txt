The reason for this is that the driver of V1 looked down to check her speedometer, causing her to drift to the left and cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2001 Dodge Ram pickup. This action by the driver of V1 resulted in a head-on collision with V2, causing severe damage to both vehicles and serious injuries to the driver of V1. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to maintain control of her vehicle and stay within her lane of travel.
