The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at a crash in the southbound lanes. This distraction caused him to fail to notice the traffic congestion ahead and be unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2000 Toyota 4 Runner) and subsequently pushing V2 into V3 (the 1995 Chevrolet Silverado pick-up). V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead led to the chain reaction collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
