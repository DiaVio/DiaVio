The driver of Vehicle #1 was cited by the police for "speed - failed to use due care" and for failing to have a valid license. Additionally, the driver admitted in their interview that they could not stop in time and were traveling approximately 65 mph, which was the posted speed limit. The critical pre-crash event for the driver of Vehicle #1 was another vehicle stopped in their lane, and the critical reason was a decision error - being too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver also had only 6 months of driving experience and was unfamiliar with the roadway. These factors contribute to the conclusion that Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
