The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling eastbound in the first lane when an elk entered the roadway from the right. - V1's front impacted the elk, causing the vehicle to veer left into the westbound lane. - V1 then collided with the front of V2 (the 2006 Nissan Titan) in the westbound lane. - V1's actions of veering into the opposite lane and colliding with V2 indicate a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision. - Although V1 mentioned that her vision was partially obscured by glare from V2's headlights, this does not absolve her of responsibility as she should have been able to anticipate and react to the presence of the elk on the roadway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to her failure to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision with V2 after colliding with the elk.
