The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, resulting in the collision with V1. The driver's statement that she looked but did not see any cars coming indicates a lack of proper observation and caution. Additionally, the driver's conversation with her daughter may have distracted her from fully focusing on the road. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
