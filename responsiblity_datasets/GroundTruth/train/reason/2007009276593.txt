The driver of V1 lost control of his vehicle while traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. This resulted in the vehicle fishtailing and ultimately colliding with V2. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by pulling over to the side of the road, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of his vehicle and adjust his speed to the wet road conditions makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
