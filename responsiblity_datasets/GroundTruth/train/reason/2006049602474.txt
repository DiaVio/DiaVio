The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection, which is an illegal maneuver. This failure to stop resulted in V2 (the 1995 Ford Escort) colliding with the left side of V1. Additionally, V3 (the 2000 Mazda Protégé) also collided with the front of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and proceed into the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic is the primary cause of the accident.
