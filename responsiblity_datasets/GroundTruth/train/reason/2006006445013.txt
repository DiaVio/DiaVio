The driver of V1 acknowledged that he was going a little too fast for the wet conditions and the dangerous part of the roadway. He attempted to avoid the non-contact vehicle by swerving to the right and then to the left, but the sharp steering maneuver caused him to lose control of his vehicle. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, with overcompensation being the critical reason for this event. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions and overcompensating while trying to avoid the non-contact vehicle.
