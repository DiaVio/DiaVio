The reason for this is that V2 abruptly changed lanes to the right, cutting off the truck driver. As a result, the truck driver had to take evasive action to the right, subsequently cutting off V1 (the Chevrolet Cobalt). This forced the driver of V1 to veer off the roadway and ultimately collide with the guardrail. Therefore, V2's lane change without proper signaling or giving enough space to the truck driver and V1 caused the chain of events leading to the crash.
