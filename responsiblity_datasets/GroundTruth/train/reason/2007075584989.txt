The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection while making a left turn, and according to the critical pre-crash event coding, the critical reason for this event was a driver-related factor: false assumption of other's actions. This suggests that V2 assumed it was safe to make the left turn without properly assessing the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 stated she entered the intersection when her traffic signal arrow turned green and saw V1 enter the intersection at the same time. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, who was already in the intersection. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their false assumption of other's actions and failure to yield the right of way.
