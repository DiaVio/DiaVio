The reason for this is that V1 ran the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2001 Mazda Protégé). V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and failure to see V2 prior to the crash indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1. Additionally, V1's medical condition and impaired vision (being far-sighted and not wearing corrective lenses) could have contributed to his inability to perceive and react to the presence of V2 in the intersection. While V2 was preoccupied with her employment and financial issues and was fatigued due to lack of sleep, these factors do not absolve V1 of responsibility for running the stop sign and causing the collision.
