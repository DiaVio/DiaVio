The reason for this is that V1 was stopped in the eastbound right curb lane, preparing to turn left. V2 (the driver of the 1998 Buick Regal) was traveling westbound in the right curb lane approaching the intersection. V1 turned in front of V2, and V2 was unable to react in time to avoid the collision. V1's inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, suggests that she did not properly observe or assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. This lack of attention and failure to see V2 resulted in the collision.
