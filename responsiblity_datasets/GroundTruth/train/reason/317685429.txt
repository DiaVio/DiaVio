The reason for V1's responsibility is that it drifted over the center double yellow lane line, crossed the westbound lane, and departed the roadway. V1 then skidded across a gravel drive, made contact with shrubbery and a tree, and came to rest with significant damage. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to stay within its lane, resulting in the accident.
