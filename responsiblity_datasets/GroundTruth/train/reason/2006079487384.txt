The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes without adequately surveilling the first lane, where V2 (the 2000 Ford Windstar) was stopped. V1's inadequate surveillance led to the collision with the rear of V2. Additionally, V1's age and driving experience may have contributed to the lack of judgment and awareness in this situation. As a sixteen-year-old driver with only one year of driving experience, V1 may not have had the necessary skills and experience to handle the traffic conditions and make safe lane changes. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in the first lane, waiting for a vehicle to parallel park. Although V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed," it does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2 was already stopped, and it was V1's responsibility to ensure a safe lane change. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to inadequate surveillance and a lack of judgment, while V2's actions, although contributing to the situation, do not shift the responsibility away from V1.
