The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit. - V1 lost control of the vehicle, indicating a lack of control and proper handling. - V1 changed lanes without maintaining proper control, resulting in contact with the back, right plane of Vehicle Two (V2). - Despite attempting to steer right to avoid the collision, V1 failed to do so and began a clockwise rotation. - V1 ultimately departed the road and collided with multiple trees, indicating a lack of control and inability to avoid the crash. These factors, including speeding, loss of control, lane change without proper control, and failure to avoid the collision, contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
