The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while rounding the curve on the on-ramp. The vehicle ran off the inside of the curve and ultimately rolled over. Since the driver's actions directly led to the loss of control and subsequent crash, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
