The reason for this is that V1 lost control as it entered a left curve and traveled off the roadway, impacting a golf cart and then continuing on to impact the left side of a parked delivery truck. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to navigate the curve properly, resulting in the collision with the golf cart and the parked truck. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's front bumper impacted the delivery truck, indicating that V1 was the striking vehicle in this collision. The fact that V1 rotated counterclockwise after impacting the truck further suggests that V1 was the one primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the frontal crash.
