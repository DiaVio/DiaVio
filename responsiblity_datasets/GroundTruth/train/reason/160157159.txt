The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it crossed the centerline and exited the east edge of the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, leading to the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not wearing her seatbelt may have contributed to the severity of her injuries. It is important to note that without further information about any external factors or involvement of other vehicles, the responsibility is solely attributed to V1 based on the given details.
