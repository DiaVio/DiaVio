The reason for this is that V2 was cited for careless driving and was traveling at a high rate of speed, weaving between lanes prior to the crash. Additionally, the tires on V2's vehicle were not properly inflated, with the left front tire being overinflated and the right rear tire being underinflated. These factors, along with the aggressive driving behavior, contributed to V2 being unable to respond to the unexpected actions of V1, who was changing lanes.
