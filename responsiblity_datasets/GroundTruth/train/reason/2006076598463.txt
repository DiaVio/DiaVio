The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving for thirteen hours straight, with his last sleep almost thirty hours before the crash. This indicates severe fatigue and drowsiness, which likely caused him to close his eyes and not notice V2 in front of him. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of 113 kmph for V1 suggests that he was driving at a higher speed than the posted limit of 105 kmph. V2 (the driver of the Ford Windstar) cannot be held primarily responsible as there is no evidence to suggest any fault on her part. She was driving within the speed limit and there is no mention of any driver-related factors that could have contributed to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to severe fatigue and drowsiness, as well as potentially exceeding the speed limit.
