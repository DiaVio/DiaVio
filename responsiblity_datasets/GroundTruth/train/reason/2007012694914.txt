The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver stated that the throttle stuck, causing the vehicle to accelerate uncontrollably. Despite attempts to slow down, the driver was unable to do so, resulting in V1 driving off the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree. The passenger also confirmed the driver's account of the throttle sticking and their unsuccessful attempts to stop the vehicle. While there is no proof of the throttle issue, the critical pre-crash event was coded as "Disabling Vehicle Failure" with the critical reason being "Other Vehicle Failure" specifically "Throttle Stuck." This suggests that the vehicle malfunction was a contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, associated factors such as traveling too fast for conditions and traveling off the roadway indicate that V1's actions were also a factor in the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the reported vehicle malfunction.
