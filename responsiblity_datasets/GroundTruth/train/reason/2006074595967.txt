The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was found to be at fault due to a driver-related factor, specifically inattention. The driver of Vehicle one failed to notice that Vehicle two (1985 Chevrolet Monte Carlo) was stopped at the intersection, resulting in a collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of Vehicle one had Parkinson's disease and was taking medication, which may have affected their ability to pay attention and react appropriately while driving. However, it is important to consider that the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that there may have been some contributing factors that are not fully known or provided in the case summary.
