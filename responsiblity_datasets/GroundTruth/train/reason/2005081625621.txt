The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control while entering a left curve with a slight downhill grade. V1 entered a counterclockwise rotation, crossed the centerline, and collided head-on with V2 (the dark gray 2003 Acura MDX). This indicates that V1 was unable to negotiate the curve safely, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for V1's loss of control was determined to be speed too fast for the conditions, which included a wet road due to rain and the curve itself. The fact that V1 had over-inflated tires, with the right rear tire being a smaller temporary spare, may have also contributed to the loss of control. On the other hand, V2's critical event was coded as "Other Vehicle Encroachment - From opposite direction - over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident, as the encroachment from V1 crossing the centerline was a contributing factor to the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inability to negotiate the curve safely and the speed being too fast for the wet road conditions.
