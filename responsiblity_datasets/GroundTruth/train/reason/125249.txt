The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted to turn left across the path of Vehicle two (V2), the 2006 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan, and was unable to avoid striking the front of V2 with the front of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
