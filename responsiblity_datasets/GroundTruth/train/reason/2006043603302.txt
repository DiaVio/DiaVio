The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet and slick road conditions caused by the rainstorm. The driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to navigate a curve, resulting in the car fishtailing and spinning out of control. Despite the driver's attempts to regain control by braking and steering, she was unable to correct the spin and ultimately drove off the left side of the road, leading to the rollover and crash. Additionally, the presence of tire deficiencies, including a right rear spare tire and two underinflated tires on the left side, likely contributed to the loss of control.
