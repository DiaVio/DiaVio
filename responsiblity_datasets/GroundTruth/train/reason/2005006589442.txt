The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making a left turn at the intersection. This is evident from the Critical Pre-Crash Event and the associated factor of inadequate surveillance, failed to look. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that the non-contact vehicle in front of her obstructed her view, indicating a lack of proper observation before initiating the turn. While V2 (the driver of the 1995 Honda Accord) did not have any critical reasons or associated factors coded against them, it is clear that V1 encroached into V2's lane from the opposite direction, causing the collision. V2's statement that she didn't have enough time to apply her brakes further supports V1's primary responsibility. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making a left turn, resulting in the collision with V2.
