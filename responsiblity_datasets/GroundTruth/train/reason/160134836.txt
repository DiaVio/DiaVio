The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it hit a patch of ice and began to skid counterclockwise, crossing into lane four where it was struck by the front of Vehicle two (V2), the 2006 Chevrolet Aveo sedan. This indicates that V1 lost control due to the icy conditions, causing it to enter the path of V2 and resulting in the collision.
