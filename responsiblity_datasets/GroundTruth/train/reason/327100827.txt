The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound and entered the intersection, colliding with the right side of V1, the 2005 four-door Cadillac DeVille. V2's impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise, indicating that V2 was the vehicle that initiated the collision.
