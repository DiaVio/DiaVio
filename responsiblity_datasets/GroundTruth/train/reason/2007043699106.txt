The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking down in the passenger floorboard for an item, which caused him to veer off the road, hit the curb, and ultimately roll over. Additionally, the driver admitted to not having driven the vehicle for two years, and the left front tire had inadequate tread depth, which could have contributed to the loss of control.
