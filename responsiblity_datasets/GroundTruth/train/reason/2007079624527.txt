The reason for this is that the witness at the scene confirmed that V2 ran the red light, indicating a clear violation of traffic signals. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to not seeing V1 prior to the impact, suggesting inadequate surveillance. The driver's claim of having a green light contradicts the witness testimony, further supporting the conclusion that V2 disregarded traffic signals. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at a red light and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the collision.
