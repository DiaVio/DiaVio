The reason for V1's responsibility is that they overcompensated while trying to avoid a collision with an unidentified van that changed lanes. This overcompensation caused V1 to lose control of their vehicle, resulting in it rotating counter clockwise, crossing through multiple lanes, and ultimately impacting the concrete traffic median. Therefore, V1's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control are the primary factors that led to the accident.
