The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was the one that lost control on the ice-covered road surface and departed from the east shoulder onto private property. The driver attempted to regain control but ended up colliding with a parked vehicle (the 2000 Volkswagen Golf) and causing minor damage. The subsequent sideswipe of another parked vehicle (Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck) also resulted in additional minor damage. Therefore, the actions and loss of control by the driver of Vehicle 1 led to the collision and subsequent injuries.
