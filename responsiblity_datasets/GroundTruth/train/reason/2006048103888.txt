The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red signal, indicating that they failed to stop when required. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and "zoning out" at the time of the crash. These factors, along with the fact that V1's vehicle sustained disabling damage, suggest that V1's actions were the main cause of the collision.
