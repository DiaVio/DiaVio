The reason for this is that Vehicle # 2 was traveling eastbound on a two-way roadway and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle # 1, which was traveling northbound on a one-way roadway. Vehicle # 2 was required to stop at the stop sign and wait for a safe opportunity to proceed through the intersection. However, the driver of Vehicle # 2 falsely assumed that the driver of Vehicle # 1 would stop, leading to the collision. Additionally, the emotional factors of the driver of Vehicle # 2, such as being concerned about his financial situation and visiting his grandmother who just came back from the hospital, may have contributed to his false assumption of the other driver's actions. Therefore, Vehicle # 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error in assuming the actions of the other driver and failing to yield the right of way.
