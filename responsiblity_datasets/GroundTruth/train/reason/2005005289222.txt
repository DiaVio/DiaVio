The witness account states that V1 was tailgating and attempting to pass in a no-passing zone before losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane" and the Critical Reason was coded as "decision error, too fast for curve." These factors indicate that V1's actions and speed were the main contributing factors to the accident.
