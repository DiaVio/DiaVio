The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not look or see V1 approaching from the right. Additionally, V2 entered the intersection on a red light, indicating a clear violation of traffic laws. The driver's confusion, likely due to his Alzheimer's disease and medication, may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation and make the appropriate decision to stop at the red light.
