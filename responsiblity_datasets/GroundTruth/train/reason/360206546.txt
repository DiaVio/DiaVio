The reason for this is that V1 was involved in a severe 50% offset frontal impact with the front of V2, the 1991 Toyota pickup truck. The direct damage extended down the left side of V1, causing lateral intrusion and immediate counterclockwise rotation of 180 degrees from the point of impact. This indicates that V1 crossed into the path of V2, resulting in the collision.
