The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to running a red light and stated that she was distracted by looking down at the instrument panel to check her headlights. Additionally, the driver mentioned several issues with her vehicle, including problems with the battery wire, wiper blade, and headlights. These factors indicate that the driver was not properly maintaining her vehicle, which could have contributed to the crash. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience (having only been driving on her own for 2 months) and the internal distraction caused by the passenger dropping a cell phone also played a role in the driver's failure to recognize the red light and stop in time. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to obey traffic signals, distracted driving, and inadequate vehicle maintenance.
