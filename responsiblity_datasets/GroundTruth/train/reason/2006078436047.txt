The reason for this is that V-1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. Despite seeing the Jeep approaching and slowing down, V-1 did not notice V-2 approaching in the #2 lane. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in V-1 pulling out into the intersection and being struck by V-2.
