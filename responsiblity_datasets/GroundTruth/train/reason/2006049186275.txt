The reason for this is that the left rear tire of Vehicle 1 experienced a complete tread separation, causing the vehicle to veer to the right and ultimately leave the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 1 indicated that the control loss occurred just as she was about to change lanes, suggesting that the tire failure was the main contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, the vehicle inspection revealed that the remaining tires on Vehicle 1 had very low tread depth, indicating a lack of proper maintenance and potentially contributing to the tire failure. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the disabling vehicle failure of the left rear tire and the vehicle-related factor of tires/wheels failing.
