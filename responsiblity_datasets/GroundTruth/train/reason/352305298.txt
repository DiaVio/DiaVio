The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted right and departed the roadway, then crossed through the gap in the barrier wall and entered the left southbound travel lane, ultimately striking Vehicle 3 and then colliding with the front left corner of Vehicle 1. This sequence of events indicates that Vehicle 2 initiated the collision by veering off the road and crossing into oncoming traffic.
