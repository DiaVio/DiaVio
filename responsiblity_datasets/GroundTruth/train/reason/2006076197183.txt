The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to avoid the large elk that suddenly approached from the right into the roadway. The driver stated she had no time to avoid the animal and struck it with the front plane. Additionally, the driver was engaged in a conversation with the passenger at the time of the crash, which may have contributed to a lack of attention and inability to react in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to avoid the animal and potential distraction from engaging in a conversation.
