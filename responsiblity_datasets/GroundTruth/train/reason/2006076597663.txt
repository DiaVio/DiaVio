The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event attributed to V1. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: internal distraction. The driver of V1 was having discussions with the passengers as he entered the intersection, indicating a lack of focus and attention on the road. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2000 Chevrolet S-10) was heading straight and was encroached upon by V1, which is a critical pre-crash event attributed to V2. However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of internal distraction while turning left at the intersection.
