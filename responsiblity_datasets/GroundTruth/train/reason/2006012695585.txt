The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by turning right onto the one-way exit ramp in the opposite direction of traffic. This action directly led to the head-on collision with Vehicle #2 (V2). Additionally, the driver of V1 reported that the brakes failed, which further contributed to the crash. While the driver of V2 was traveling in the correct direction and had no time to brake or steer to avoid the crash, their actions were not the primary cause of the collision. V2 was following the appropriate traffic laws and was not engaged in any illegal maneuvers. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the combination of making an illegal turn and the reported brake failure.
