The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver stated that he stopped behind the wall and could not see to his left, but proceeded anyway since he didn't see any approaching headlights. This indicates a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was conversing with his passenger, who was apparently inebriated. This distraction could have further impaired the driver's ability to make a safe turn. Furthermore, V1 had low tread on the left rear tire, which could have affected the vehicle's handling and stability during the turn. Overall, V1's decision error, combined with the distraction and the vehicle's maintenance issue, make the driver primarily responsible for the accident.
