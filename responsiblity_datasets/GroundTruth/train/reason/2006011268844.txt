The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was observed swerving back and forth across both lanes before leaving the road on the right side. The driver was also distracted by messing around with his CDs and stated that he was tired from too little sleep. Additionally, speed too fast was coded to this driver. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper control of the vehicle and was not fully attentive to the road conditions, leading to the accident.
