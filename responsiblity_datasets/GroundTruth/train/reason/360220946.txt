The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and V1, the 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, entered the intersection while V2 was in the process of making the left turn. V1 attempted to brake, but the front of V1 still impacted the left side of V2. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
