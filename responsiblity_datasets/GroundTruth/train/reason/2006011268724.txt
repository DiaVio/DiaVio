The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 steered left to avoid the non-contact medium/heavy truck encroaching into their lane. While the driver successfully avoided the truck, they over-steered, causing V1 to crash into the median guardrail. This incorrect evasive action by the driver of V1 led to the crash.
