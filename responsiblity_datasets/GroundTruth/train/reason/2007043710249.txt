The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 was stopped in the travel lane ahead with its left turn signal activated. V1 collided with the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead. The driver of V1 admitted to daydreaming while driving and also mentioned that the brakes on his wife's car were not as responsive as his work truck. This suggests that the driver of V1 was not fully focused on the road and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the EDR data from V1's vehicle indicated that the brakes were not activated at the time of the collision. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
