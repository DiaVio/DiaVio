The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was impaired by drugs and alcohol, as evidenced by the positive test results for THC and cocaine, as well as the high blood alcohol concentration of .229. Additionally, the driver's claim of a blown tire was not supported by evidence at the scene or during vehicle inspection. Trajectory evidence suggests that the driver had fallen asleep and took no evasive actions, indicating a lack of attention and control over the vehicle. These factors, combined with the driver's impaired state, contribute to V1's responsibility for the crash.
