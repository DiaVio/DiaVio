The driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead when the traffic slowed and was traveling too fast for the environmental conditions and traffic. This led to the driver steering right and braking hard, causing the vehicle to run off the right side of the road during heavy rain. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and adjust their speed accordingly ultimately resulted in the crash.
