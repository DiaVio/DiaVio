The driver of V1 stated that they were traveling at a speed of 70-80 mph, which is above the posted speed limit of 70 mph. Additionally, they admitted to being distracted by the non-contact vehicle swerving onto the shoulder, which caused them to not notice the stopped traffic ahead in time. This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their excessive speed, failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, and a recognition error in not noticing the stopped traffic.
