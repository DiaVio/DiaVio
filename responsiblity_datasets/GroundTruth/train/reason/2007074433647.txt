The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped." This suggests that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and was unable to stop in time, resulting in a rear-end collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This indicates that there was some form of driver error on the part of the driver of V1, although the specific details are not provided. Therefore, based on the information given, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and avoid a rear-end collision.
