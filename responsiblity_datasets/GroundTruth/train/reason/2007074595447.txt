The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention and daydreaming while driving. This lack of attention led to the driver abruptly steering to the right when she realized the traffic signal was red and another vehicle was approaching the intersection. The driver's poor directional control and overcompensation further contributed to the crash.
