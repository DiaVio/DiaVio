The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is as follows: 1. V1 was traveling northeast on a two-lane roadway and failed to negotiate a right-sweeping curve with a downgrade. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve. 2. The roadway was snowy due to drifted snow, which could have contributed to reduced traction and increased the difficulty of maneuvering the curve safely. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and speed according to the road conditions. 3. V1 traversed the intersection and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated roadway. 4. The driver of V1 was not restrained by a three-point belt, which may have contributed to the severity of her injuries. It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure they are properly restrained for their safety. 5. The right-rear passenger of V1 was also not restrained by a three-point belt, which resulted in severe injuries. The driver of V1 has a responsibility to ensure that all passengers are properly restrained. Overall, the combination of the driver's failure to negotiate the curve, the departure from the roadway, and the lack of proper restraints for both the driver and the right-rear passenger indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
