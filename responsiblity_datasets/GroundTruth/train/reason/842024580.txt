The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 broke traction on the wet pavement and hydroplaned, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and depart from the left pavement edge. This resulted in Vehicle 1 entering the center wooded median and ultimately colliding with a cluster of trees. The overlapping damage sustained by Vehicle 1 indicates that it was the vehicle that initiated the impact with the trees.
