The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 encroached into V2's travel lane, causing the collision. V1 was traveling at a slower speed than the rest of the traffic, which was indicated as a driver-related error. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to adequately check the adjacent lane before moving over, indicating inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 also admitted to being fatigued, which could have contributed to the driver's error in judgment. On the other hand, there is no information provided that suggests any fault or contributing factors on the part of the driver of V2. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
