The reason for V1's responsibility is that the collision occurred due to a non-disabling vehicle problem, specifically partial tread separation on the left rear wheel. This caused V1 to lose control and initiate a clockwise yaw, ultimately resulting in the collision with the warning sign and the hillside embankment. The driver of V1 was unable to recover from the loss of control, indicating a failure to properly respond to the vehicle-related issue.
