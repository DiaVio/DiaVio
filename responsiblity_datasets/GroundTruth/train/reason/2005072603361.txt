The reason for this is that the driver of V1 disregarded the stop sign and continued westbound across the northbound section of the roadway. This action violated the right of way of the vehicles traveling northbound, including V2 (the 2004 Dodge Stratus) and V3 (the 1997 Buick Riviera). By failing to stop at the stop sign, V1 created a dangerous situation and caused the collision with V2. The driver of V2 attempted to stop but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the stop sign and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic is the primary reason for the accident.
