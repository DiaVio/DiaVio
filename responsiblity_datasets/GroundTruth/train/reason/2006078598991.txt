The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to make a left turn across three eastbound lanes without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver stated that an oncoming driver stopped and motioned for him to turn, but it is the responsibility of the turning driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed. V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and turned with an obstructed view, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1997 Cadillac Deville Concourse sedan) attempted to avoid the collision by hard braking, indicating that V2 was exercising caution and reacting appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
