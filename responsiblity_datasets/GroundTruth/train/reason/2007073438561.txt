The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to driving at a high speed of approximately 80 mph (129 kmph), which is significantly above the speed limit of 55 mph (89 kmph). Additionally, the driver stated that she was stressed due to an adversarial relationship with her management at work. These factors, along with the driver's poor directional control, indicate aggressive driving behavior, which was the critical reason for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's aggressive driving behavior, high speed, and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
