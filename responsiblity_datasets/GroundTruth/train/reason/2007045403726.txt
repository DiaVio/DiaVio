The reason for V1's responsibility is that it failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead (V2) and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. This is evident from the fact that V1 ran into the rear of V2 after applying its brakes with lockup. V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and inability to stop in time indicates a lack of attention and/or excessive speed for the traffic conditions.
