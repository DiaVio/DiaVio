The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that he looked but did not see anyone coming before starting to turn left. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surroundings. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, having only been driving for two years, may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation and respond in a timely manner when he did see V1 approaching from the left.
