The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the intentions of V2 (the driver of the 2005 Buick Lacrosse). V1 assumed that V2 was also going to turn left, even though V2 had its blinker on and was in the lane for going straight. This false assumption led V1 to make a left turn in front of V2, resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, was driving within the speed limit and had the right of way since they were going straight. The unfamiliarity with the vehicle, being the first time driving that particular vehicle, is not a significant factor in determining responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the decision error of falsely assuming the actions of V2.
