The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 reacted by jerking the wheel hard to the left and then back to the right, resulting in a loss of control and the vehicle rolling over. This sudden and sharp turn to the left, followed by overcompensation, indicates a performance error on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver's statement that he turned sharply to the left to avoid hitting another vehicle suggests that he may not have been maintaining proper control of his own vehicle and failed to anticipate the actions of other drivers. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the critical pre-crash event and reason coded for V1, it can be concluded that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
