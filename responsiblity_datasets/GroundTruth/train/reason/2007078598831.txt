The driver of V1 was distracted by the non-contact pickup truck that changed lanes in front of her and made a left turn. She was focused on the turning truck and did not look for oncoming traffic. This lack of attention and inadequate surveillance led to her making a left turn without noticing V2 approaching from the opposite direction.
