The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign. Although V1 claims to have stopped and rolled forward to check if it was clear, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed before entering the intersection. V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) had the right of way as there was no stop sign for the north-south roadway. Additionally, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to stop for the traffic control device (stop sign) further contribute to their responsibility for the collision.
