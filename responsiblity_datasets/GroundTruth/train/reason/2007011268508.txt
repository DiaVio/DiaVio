The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down inside the vehicle, which led to V1 leaving the road on the left side initially. This recognition error and internal distraction caused the driver to overcompensate and lose control of the vehicle, resulting in it crossing both lanes of traffic and ultimately rolling over. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance error and recognition error caused by internal distraction.
