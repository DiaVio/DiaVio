The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling in the fourth lane, which is designated for left turns only, and they failed to stop in time to avoid colliding with the back of V2 (the Honda Odyssey). Additionally, V1 fled the scene after the crash, which further indicates their responsibility for the accident.
