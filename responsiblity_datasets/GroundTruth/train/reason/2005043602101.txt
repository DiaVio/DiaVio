The driver of V1 was distracted by eating a sandwich while driving, which caused her to fail to recognize the stopped traffic ahead of her. Additionally, she claimed that her brakes failed, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Her inadequate evasive action, including swerving into another lane without checking for traffic, further contributed to the accident.
