The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was fatigued and drowsy, which was noted by the police at the scene. Despite claiming to be well-rested, the driver had only slept for 4.5 hours the night before the crash, which is significantly less than her usual average of 8 hours of sleep. Fatigue is known to impair driving ability and increase the risk of accidents. Additionally, the critical precrash event was coded as V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically internal distraction. While the driver blamed the loss of control on sneezing, it is clear that fatigue played a role as an associative factor. Therefore, based on the driver's fatigue, drowsiness, and loss of control, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
