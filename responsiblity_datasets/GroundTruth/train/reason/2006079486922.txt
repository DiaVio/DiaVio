The driver of V1 became distracted while driving after spilling coffee on his lap and attempting to clean it up. This distraction caused him to take his eyes off the road and collide with the rear of V2 (the gold Nissan Frontier) when he looked up again. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper control of his vehicle led to the crash.
