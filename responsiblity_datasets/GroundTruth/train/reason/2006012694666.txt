The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related error by panicking or freezing when they saw the approaching police vehicle. Instead of completing their left turn and clearing the intersection, V1 stopped in the middle of the intersection, causing V2 (the driver of the 2000 Dodge Dakota) to collide with the front of V1. Additionally, V1's incorrect evasive action of stopping in the intersection instead of clearing it further supports their primary responsibility for the accident. V2, on the other hand, had the right of way as they were proceeding straight through the intersection when the light turned green. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking but was unable to do so due to V1's sudden stop. Therefore, V1's panic or freezing, as well as their incorrect evasive action, make them primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
