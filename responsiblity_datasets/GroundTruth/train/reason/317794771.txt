The reason for this is that V2 was traveling south in the southbound lane and collided with the left side of V1, which was traveling east in the eastbound lane. V2's contact with V1 caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and depart the roadway, resulting in serious injury to the right front passenger of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield or properly navigate the intersection led to the collision and subsequent injuries, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
