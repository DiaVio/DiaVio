The reason for V1's responsibility is that it impacted the back of V2 (the 1988 Nissan Pathfinder) while V2 was legally parked on the side of the road. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance or failed to pay attention to the parked vehicle, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 indicates that it was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, further suggesting driver error on the part of V1. However, it is important to note that the driver of V1 refused to participate in the study, which could have provided more insight into the exact circumstances leading to the crash.
