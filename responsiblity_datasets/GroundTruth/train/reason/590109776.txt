The reason for this is that V2 was traveling westbound and negotiating a sweeping right curve at a speed too great to keep the vehicle in its own lane. As a result, V2 traveled into the opposing eastbound lane, directly towards the vehicle in front of V1. This sudden intrusion into the opposing lane created a dangerous situation and forced the driver of V1 to swerve onto the right shoulder to avoid a collision. The driver of V1 attempted to brake, but was unable to avoid the collision with V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for causing the collision by crossing into the opposing lane.
