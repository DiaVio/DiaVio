The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound and crossed the path of V1, which was westbound. V2 encroached into the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1. This is evident from the witness statement indicating that V2 had a green light. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and encroachment into the intersection caused the collision with V1.
