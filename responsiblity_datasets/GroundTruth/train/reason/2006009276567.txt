The reason for this is that V1 proceeded into the intersection without yielding to V2 (the 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee), causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not know there was a stop sign at the intersection, indicating a lack of awareness and failure to follow traffic rules.
