The driver of V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2, which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3. V1 admitted to possibly looking away for a second and being distracted by the road construction on the right side. This distraction, along with the driver's false assumption that the forward traffic was going to proceed, led to V1 not stopping in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and their distraction from the road construction are the main reasons for their primary responsibility in the accident.
