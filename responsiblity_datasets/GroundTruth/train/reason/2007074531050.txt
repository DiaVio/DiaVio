The driver of V1 admitted to driving fast and being mad, which indicates a lack of control and emotional state that likely contributed to the crash. Additionally, V1 was the vehicle that initially departed the roadway and then overcompensated, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and enter the westbound lanes. This erratic maneuver directly led to the collision with V2 and V3. Therefore, V1's speed, overcompensation, and emotional state make them primarily responsible for the crash.
