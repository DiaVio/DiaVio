The reason for this is that V1 was traveling southbound and failed to stop at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. V2, on the other hand, was traveling westbound and had the right of way since there were no controls for eastbound and westbound traffic. The driver of V2 reported that he saw V1 approaching but assumed that V1 would stop at the stop sign. Although the driver of V2 had associative factors of false assumption and fatigue, the critical reason for the collision was attributed to V1's illegal maneuver.
