The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which caused their vehicle to hydroplane and collide with the back of V2 (the 1999 Ford F-150). V1's decision error of not realizing the need for caution on wet roads and their limited driving experience also contributed to the crash. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in lane 1, waiting to make a left turn, and there were no driver performance factors coded for the driver of V2. Therefore, V2 does not appear to have any responsibility for the accident.
