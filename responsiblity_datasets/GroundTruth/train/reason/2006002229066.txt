The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by looking at pastries inside the vehicle, which is considered an internal distraction. This distraction likely caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in it going off the road, impacting an embankment, and rolling over multiple times. Additionally, the driver mentioned steering too much to the left and then overcorrecting to the right, which further indicates driver error and lack of control. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's internal distraction and subsequent loss of control.
