The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver exhibited poor control of the vehicle due to their inexperience driving a rear-wheel drive (RWD) vehicle. The driver downshifted to 2nd gear, causing the rear wheels to lose traction on an icy patch. Instead of maintaining control and correcting the vehicle's direction, the driver over-corrected by steering hard left, which resulted in the vehicle crossing into lane two and ultimately striking the median barrier.
