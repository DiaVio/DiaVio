The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a very high rate of speed (113 kmph or 70 mph) on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph) and warning signs for the curve and speed reduction. Additionally, the driver stated that he was going around 113 kmph before the crash, indicating that he was aware of his excessive speed. Furthermore, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. The underinflated left rear tire may have also contributed to the loss of control. Overall, the driver's excessive speed and failure to adjust for the curve, combined with the underinflated tire, demonstrate a lack of caution and responsibility, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
