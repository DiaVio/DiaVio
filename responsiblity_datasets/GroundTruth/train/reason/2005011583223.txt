The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was found to have poor directional control, as evidenced by their movement over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. This resulted in the sideswiping of Vehicle 2 (V2). Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned feeling uncomfortable with the width of their vehicle, which could have contributed to their inadequate evasive action. While there were contributing factors such as the absence of lights or flashers on V2, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to their poor control of the vehicle.
