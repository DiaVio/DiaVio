The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior by racing another vehicle. This aggressive behavior likely contributed to the driver losing control of the vehicle, resulting in it running off the right side of the roadway and colliding with signposts. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only been driving for two years with no training, which may have contributed to their inability to handle the vehicle properly during the race. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's aggressive driving behavior and lack of experience.
