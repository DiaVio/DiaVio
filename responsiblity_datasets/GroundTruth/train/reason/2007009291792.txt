The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making a left turn. The driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event, led to the collision with V2 (the 2002 Mercedes-Benz C320). Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he was unaware of V2's approach and didn't know what hit him after the crash, further indicating a lack of attention and awareness. While V2 was traveling at a relatively high speed, the driver and passenger of V2 both stated that V1 suddenly pulled out in front of them, leaving them with no time to react or avoid the crash. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly surveil the oncoming traffic before making a left turn.
