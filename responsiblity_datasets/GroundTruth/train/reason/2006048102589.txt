The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before entering, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 2003 Ford E-series ambulance). V1 stated that they thought the non-contact vehicle was stopped to allow them to enter the roadway, indicating a failure to properly assess the situation. Additionally, V2 was traveling with emergency lights activated, indicating that they were responding to an emergency call. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from driveway, turning into same direction," suggesting that V1's actions were the cause of the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the roadway and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
