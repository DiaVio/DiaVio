The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Despite yielding to two or three cars, V1 did not see V2 (the driver of the Nissan Pathfinder) approaching in lane one. As a result, V1 pulled out into the intersection, causing V2 to collide with the left side of V1. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 prior to entering the intersection make them primarily responsible for the accident.
