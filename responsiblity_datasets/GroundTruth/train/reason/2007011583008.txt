The driver of V1 was experiencing nausea and attempted to pull over to the right shoulder. However, while reaching for a bucket to vomit, she accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake, causing V1 to veer off the road and collide with various objects. The driver's critical non-performance due to sickness and vomiting, as well as her inappropriate evasive action of accelerating instead of braking, contributed to the crash. Additionally, the possible side effects of her prescribed medication for depression were also considered as an associated factor.
