The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not notice V2 stopped at the intersection until it was too late to stop. This is supported by the witness statement, which indicates that V1 was traveling at a high speed (approximately 80 kmph or 50 mph) and did not have enough time to stop before colliding with the back of V2. Additionally, V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "inadequate surveillance." Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain proper observation and react in a timely manner to the stopped vehicle ahead.
