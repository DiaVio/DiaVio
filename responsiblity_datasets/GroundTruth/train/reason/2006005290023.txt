The driver of V2 claimed that the vehicle in front of her (V1) suddenly slammed on her brakes as the traffic signal changed to yellow. However, it is stated that V2 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, which was coded as a decision error. This indicates that the driver of V2 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, there are no known associated factors coded to V1, suggesting that the driver of V1 did not contribute to the cause of the crash. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to following too closely and failing to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
