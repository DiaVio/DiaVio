The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the 2003 Dodge Durango SUV). V1 assumed that V2 had stopped to allow the non-contact vehicle to proceed, and therefore proceeded with her left turn. However, V2 was actually intending to pass straight through the intersection, resulting in the collision between the front of V1 and the left side of V2. V2, on the other hand, reported that he had to brake when the non-contact vehicle turned in front of him, and then noticed V1 and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and veering right. Therefore, V2's actions were a response to the situation created by V1's false assumption, rather than being the primary cause of the collision.
