The reason for this is that V1, the hit and run vehicle, attempted to switch lanes into the right-hand lane (lane 2) and sideswiped V2, causing V2 to lose control and veer into lane one where it collided with V3. The white paint transfer on the left side of V2's vehicle confirms the presence of the hit and run vehicle. Since V1 fled the scene, it is considered the main factor in causing the crash.
