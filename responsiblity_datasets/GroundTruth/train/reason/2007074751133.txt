The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they traveled off the right side of the roadway, indicating a driver-related factor of overcompensation. This means that V1 likely overcorrected when they initially veered off the road, causing them to abruptly steer left and re-enter the roadway, ultimately leading to the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 2006 Ford F150 pickup) was unable to steer to the left or right due to other vehicles in those lanes, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the adjacent lane. This suggests that V2 was not the primary cause of the accident, but rather a result of V1's actions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their overcompensation and subsequent collision with V2.
