The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at her speedometer and being emotionally upset due to an argument with her boyfriend. She also acknowledged that she was traveling too fast for the conditions of the gravel roadway. These factors, along with her overcompensation when she realized she had drifted into the oncoming lane, led to the loss of control and subsequent rollover of her vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distracted and emotionally upset state, as well as traveling too fast for the conditions of the road.
