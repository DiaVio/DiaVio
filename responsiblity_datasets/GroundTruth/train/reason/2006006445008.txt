The driver of V1 admitted to "messing up" and the physical evidence supports the statement made by the driver of V2 (the 2003 Cadillac Escalade) that V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the northbound street. V1 entered the intersection and was struck by V2, causing V1 to be pushed in a northwardly direction and sustain disabling damage to its right front wheel. The Critical Pre-Crash Category and Event coded to V1 was "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection" and the Critical Reason for Critical Pre-Crash Event was "Driver Related Factor/Unknown recognition error." This suggests that the driver of V1 made an error in recognizing the situation and failed to yield the right of way to V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while making a left turn.
