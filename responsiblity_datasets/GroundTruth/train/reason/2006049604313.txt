The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. When the unidentified vehicle accelerated and passed V1 on the right, the driver overcompensated by steering to the left, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with the concrete medians. This indicates a driver-related performance factor, specifically overcompensation, as the critical reason for the accident.
