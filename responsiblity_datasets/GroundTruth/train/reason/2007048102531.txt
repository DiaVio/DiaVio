The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the right side of the road, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V1 overcompensated by steering left and then right, which resulted in V1 crossing the center line and ultimately colliding with an embankment on the right side of the road. The police reported travel speed of 72 kmph for V1 also suggests that the driver was exceeding the speed limit of 56 kmph, which was an associated factor in the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, overcompensation, and exceeding the speed limit, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
