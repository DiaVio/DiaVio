The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop at the stop sign and crossed into the intersection, colliding with V1. The driver of V2 stated that she was distracted and looking for street signs, which caused her to not see the stop sign or V1 prior to the crash. This driver-related factor of external distraction led to the critical pre-crash event for V2, which was crossing over the intersection. On the other hand, the driver of V1 was stopped at the stop sign and assumed that V2 would stop, which was an associated factor in the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for failing to yield the right-of-way and causing the collision.
