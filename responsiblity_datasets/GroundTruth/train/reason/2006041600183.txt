The driver admitted to changing lanes without adequately surveilling the area and did not see V2 (the driver of the 2001 Toyota Avalon) in the lane before making the lane change. This inadequate surveillance and failure to ensure a clear lane change led to the collision between V1 and V2, causing V2 to spin out of control. Therefore, V1's improper lane change and failure to exercise caution are the main factors contributing to the crash.
