The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The witness stated that V1 stopped at the stop sign, entered the intersection, and then stopped again, indicating a lack of awareness of oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1 mentioned that there were parked vehicles on the southeast corner that obstructed his view, but it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the intersection is clear before proceeding. The driver's inexperience may have also played a role in the inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, V2 (the 34-year-old male driving the Ford Taurus) attempted to avoid the collision by moving to the left turn lane and then swerving back towards his original lane. However, V1 continued with the left turn, causing V2 to collide with the left rear side of V1. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
