The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they ignored a stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding to V2 (the 1997 Plymouth Voyager). This action directly led to the collision between the front of V1 and the right side of V2. Additionally, V1 admitted to missing the stop sign and only detecting V2 1-2 seconds prior to impact, indicating a lack of adequate surveillance and failure to look or see the oncoming vehicle. V1 did not have enough reaction time to attempt any evasive maneuvers before the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the stop sign and their inadequate surveillance are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the accident.
