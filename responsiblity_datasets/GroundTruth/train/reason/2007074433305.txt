The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is considered a higher-risk maneuver. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that there was some error or mistake made by the driver of V1, although the specific details are not provided. While the vision restriction created by the snow bank in the northeast corner of the intersection may have been a contributing factor, it does not absolve V1 of responsibility for making a safe left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their left turn maneuver and the unknown driver error.
