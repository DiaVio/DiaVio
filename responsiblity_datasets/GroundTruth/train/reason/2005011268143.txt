The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle when encountering ice on the slushy road. Despite attempting to slow down and make slight steering adjustments, the driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 leaving the road, rolling/falling over an embankment, and coming to rest in a creek on its roof. The contributing factor of "traveling too fast for conditions-did not realize caution was required" further supports V1's primary responsibility, as the driver was not able to anticipate the presence of ice on the road and adjust their driving accordingly.
