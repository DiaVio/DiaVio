The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was not using the seat belt restraint, which is a violation of traffic laws and safety regulations. This lack of restraint contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the driver and the damage caused to V1. If the driver had been properly restrained, the impact and resulting injuries may have been less severe. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that her visibility was impaired due to another vehicle splashing water onto her windshield. While this may have been a contributing factor, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to maintain control of their vehicle and adjust their driving behavior accordingly. The driver of V1 should have slowed down and taken appropriate measures to ensure their safety, such as using windshield wipers and adjusting their speed to the road conditions. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to their failure to use the seat belt restraint and potentially inadequate response to the impaired visibility caused by the splashed water.
