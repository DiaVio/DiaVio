The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling on the main road. Vehicle 1 was making a left turn from the alley/parking entrance onto the north/south roadway, and it is believed that the illegally parked trailer obstructed the driver's view. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to make the turn before proceeding. Additionally, Vehicle 1's failure to yield resulted in the acute angled impact with Vehicle 2, causing both vehicles to sustain damage and the driver of Vehicle 1 to be hospitalized for several weeks.
