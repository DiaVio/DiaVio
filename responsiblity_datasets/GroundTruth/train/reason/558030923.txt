The reason for this is that the case vehicle drifted to the left and the driver attempted to correct by steering right. However, this correction caused the vehicle to fishtail to the left. The driver then steered left again, which resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle. As a result, the case vehicle entered a counterclockwise rotation and rolled multiple times before coming to rest. The driver's actions of overcorrecting and losing control of the vehicle indicate a lack of proper control and caution, which ultimately led to the accident. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of the case vehicle (V1).
