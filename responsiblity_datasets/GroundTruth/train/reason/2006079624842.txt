The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the two-way left turn lane, which is intended for vehicles making left turns, while intending to go straight. This is considered an illegal maneuver and contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 was confused about which lane she was traveling in, indicating a lack of awareness and potentially impaired judgment. On the other hand, V1 (the driver of the 2003 Chevrolet Suburban) was stopped in the two-way left turn lane, waiting for clear southbound traffic before making a left turn. While V1 may have had a partially obstructed view of V2's approach due to stopped traffic, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for being in the wrong lane and making an illegal maneuver. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the collision.
