The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the eastbound lanes to access the on-ramp. This action requires the driver of V1 to yield to oncoming traffic, which in this case was V2 (the driver of the Ford Festiva hatchback). V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision.
