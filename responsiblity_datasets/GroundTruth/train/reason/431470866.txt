The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the left pavement edge and enter a shallow ditch, resulting in a series of impacts with bushes, rocks, and the ditch itself. The driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and did not stay within the designated lane, leading to the collision.
