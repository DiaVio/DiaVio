The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle # 2 was coded as another motor vehicle encroaching into the lane, from the adjacent lane (same direction) over the left lane line. This indicates that Vehicle # 2 crossed over the left lane line and impacted Vehicle # 1, which was making a right turn at the intersection. Although the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to the driver of Vehicle # 2, it can be inferred that the driver of Vehicle # 2 failed to maintain their lane and encroached into the lane of Vehicle # 1, resulting in the collision. Therefore, Vehicle # 2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain their lane and encroaching into the lane of Vehicle # 1.
