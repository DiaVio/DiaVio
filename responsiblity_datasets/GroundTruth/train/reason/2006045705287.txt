The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. This is evident from the critical reason coded as a driver-related factor, traveling too fast for conditions. Additionally, the associated factors such as the rain, wet roads, and low tread of the tires contribute to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. The fact that the driver had only rarely driven this road may have also contributed to his lack of familiarity with the road's characteristics and the need to adjust his driving behavior accordingly.
