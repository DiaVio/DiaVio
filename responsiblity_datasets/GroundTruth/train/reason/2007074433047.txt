The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a building to the right and not noticing that the other vehicles had stopped. This distraction caused her to fail to notice the stopped vehicles in front of her and ultimately resulted in the chain reaction collision. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, with only four months of driving experience, was identified as an associated factor in the crash.
