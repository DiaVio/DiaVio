The reason for this is that the case vehicle (V1), a 2000 Saturn LS 2 4-door sedan, was traveling in a westerly direction in the outside westbound lane, while the POV (V2) was traveling in a northerly direction in the inside northbound through lane. As the case vehicle (V1) was passing through the intersection, it was struck in the left side by the front of the POV (V2). This indicates that the POV (V2) failed to yield the right of way to the case vehicle (V1) while crossing the intersection, resulting in the collision.
