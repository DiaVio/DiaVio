The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 stated that his line of sight was limited due to a large tree, a utility pole, and the rainy conditions. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed before making a left turn. In this case, V2 entered the intersection without properly assessing the speed and distance of V1, resulting in the collision.
