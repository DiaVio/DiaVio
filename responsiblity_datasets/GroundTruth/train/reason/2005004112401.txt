The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left turn at a T-intersection at too wide of an angle, causing the vehicle to depart the roadway and collide with various objects. This was due to the driver's confusion and performance error, as she did not press down hard enough on the accelerator prior to the turn and then failed to ease up on the accelerator as she began the turn. There is no substantiation to the driver's claim that the vehicle suddenly accelerated on its own. Additionally, the driver of V1 had several physical ailments, including high blood pressure, cataracts, myopic vision, hearing deficit, and a pacemaker. She also takes several medications for her ailments. These factors may have contributed to her poor directional control and inability to properly navigate the turn. Furthermore, the driver's emotional state, being upset by the vehicles behind her honking their horns, may have also affected her decision-making and ability to control the vehicle effectively. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's confusion, performance error, physical ailments, and emotional state.
