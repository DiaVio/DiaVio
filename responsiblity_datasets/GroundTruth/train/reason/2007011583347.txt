The driver of V1 was driving too fast for the conditions of the gravel/slag roadway, which had a non-posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55mph). Additionally, the driver was fatigued from lack of sleep and had been drinking the night before, resulting in a .004 reading on a PBT at the scene of the crash. These factors, coupled with the driver being in a hurry and having concerns about her life, contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and ultimately led to the crash.
