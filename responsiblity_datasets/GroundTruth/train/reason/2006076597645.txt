The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, which is a driver-related factor. The driver admitted to being fatigued from cleaning and packing for her move, and she could not remember much just prior to the crash, indicating that she dozed off while driving. Falling asleep while driving is a serious negligence on the part of the driver and is a major contributing factor to the crash.
