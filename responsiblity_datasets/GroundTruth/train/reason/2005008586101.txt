The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight in its lane. The front of Vehicle 1 made contact with the front of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 crossed into the path of Vehicle 2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 refused to give an interview, making it difficult to determine any other factors that may have contributed to the accident.
