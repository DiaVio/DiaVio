The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 77-year-old female, failed to adequately surveil the road before making the left turn. Although she looked in the direction of Vehicle #2 (V2) prior to turning, she did not notice it approaching from the north. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, it is mentioned that the V1 driver had a restriction on her motor vehicle operator's license for non-use of prescription glasses, which could have contributed to her failure to see V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
