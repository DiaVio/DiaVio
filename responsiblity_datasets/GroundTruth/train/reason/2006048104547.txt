The driver of V1 admitted to being internally distracted while adjusting the vehicle's radio, which led to him losing control of the vehicle. This distraction caused V1 to depart from the right side of the roadway, re-enter the roadway, and eventually strike several small trees before coming to rest off the roadway. Therefore, the driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the main reasons for the accident.
