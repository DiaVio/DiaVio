The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 while making a left turn at the intersection. V2 came to a complete stop at the stop sign and then entered the intersection, but did not give enough time or space for V1 to pass through before making the left turn. This resulted in V1 colliding with the left side of V2. Additionally, the witness report stating that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the impact suggests that V1 may have been exceeding the speed limit. However, this does not absolve V2 of responsibility for failing to yield the right of way. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while making a left turn at the intersection.
