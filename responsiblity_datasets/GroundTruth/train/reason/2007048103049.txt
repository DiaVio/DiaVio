The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Tahoe). V1's focus on V3 (the police vehicle with emergency lights) and their emotional state of being upset about being stopped by the police likely contributed to their failure to see V2 and realize that it was not safe to make the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and their distraction by the police vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
