The reason for Vehicle 2's primary responsibility is that the driver of Vehicle 2 made a false assumption about the actions of Vehicle 1 (Ford Windstar). The driver of Vehicle 2 assumed that Vehicle 1 would turn right (north) instead of proceeding through the intersection. This false assumption led to Vehicle 2 turning left across the path of Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
