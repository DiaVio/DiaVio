The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at an unsafe speed for the extreme curves and wet road conditions. The speed limit for the area was 56 kmph (35 mph), but the driver was reported to be traveling at 72 kmph (45 mph). This excessive speed, combined with the wet road conditions and the curvature of the roadway, caused the vehicle to fishtail and the driver to lose control, ultimately resulting in the crash.
