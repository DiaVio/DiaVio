The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 attempted to pass another vehicle on the left side on an icy road, which resulted in the loss of control and the subsequent collision with a tree. This action of overtaking on an icy surface indicates a failure to exercise caution and adapt to the road conditions, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
