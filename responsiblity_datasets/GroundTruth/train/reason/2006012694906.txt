The reason for this is as follows: - The driver admitted to tapping the brakes and trying to counter steer out of the rotation, which indicates a performance error and poor directional control. - The driver also mentioned not liking the brakes on the vehicle, suggesting a lack of familiarity and confidence in handling the vehicle. - The driver had only 8 months of driving experience and was not experienced in driving on gravel roads, which could have contributed to her inability to maintain control on the loose gravel. - The driver was taking medication for depression, which had side effects of dizziness and drowsiness, potentially impairing her ability to drive safely. - The witness reported that the vehicle was traveling at a high rate of speed, indicating a speed factor that may have contributed to the loss of control. Overall, the combination of inexperience, medication side effects, poor vehicle control, and potentially excessive speed makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
