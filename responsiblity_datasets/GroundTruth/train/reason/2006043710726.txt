The reason for this is that V2 was making an illegal maneuver by creeping into the intersection while the light was still red. V2's attention was focused on the red light, causing her to not realize that she had traveled so far into the intersection. Additionally, V2 admitted that her view to the left was obstructed by shrubbery and she never saw V1 coming. Therefore, V2's illegal maneuver and failure to yield to oncoming traffic, along with her obstructed view, led to the collision with V1.
