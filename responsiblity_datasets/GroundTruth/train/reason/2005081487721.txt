The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. This means that V1 either did not look or looked but did not see the oncoming V2 (the 1990 Chrysler Imperial). As a result, V1 entered the intersection and was impacted on the left side by the front of V2.
