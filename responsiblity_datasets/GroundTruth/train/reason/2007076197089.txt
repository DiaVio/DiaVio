The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is a driver-related factor. This indicates that the driver was not alert and in control of the vehicle, leading to the gradual departure from the road edge and the subsequent impact with the embankment. Falling asleep while driving is a dangerous behavior that significantly increases the risk of accidents, as it impairs the driver's ability to react to road conditions and maintain control of the vehicle.
