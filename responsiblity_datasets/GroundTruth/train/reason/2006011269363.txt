The reason for this is that V1 was exiting a commercial drive and attempting to turn left onto the roadway. V2 (the 2004 Honda Pilot) was already eastbound in the through lane and had the right of way. V1 pulled out into the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, witnesses at the scene reported that a non-contact vehicle turned into the shopping center from the right turn lane just prior to V1 entering the intersection. This non-contact vehicle could have obstructed V1's view of V2, but ultimately it is still V1's responsibility to ensure it is safe to proceed before turning. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to yield the right of way and not exercising proper caution when turning left at the intersection.
