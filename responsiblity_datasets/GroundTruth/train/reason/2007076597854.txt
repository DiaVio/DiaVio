The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that initially steered off the right road edge for an unknown reason. The driver then made a hard left-hand steering input, causing the vehicle to rotate and cross the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1999 GMC pickup). Although there is limited information about the known factors and no interviews with either driver, the witness listed on the police report indicated that the driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control prior to the crash. This suggests that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the crash.
