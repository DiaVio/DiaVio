The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was driving the wrong way on the freeway off-ramp, entering the freeway in the wrong direction. This action directly led to the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2) and subsequently with Vehicle 3 (V3). V1's incorrect maneuver created a dangerous situation for all vehicles involved and ultimately caused the series of collisions.
