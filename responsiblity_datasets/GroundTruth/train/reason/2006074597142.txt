The driver of V2 was turning right at the intersection and took the turn too fast, which was identified as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. Additionally, the driver of V2 had been under a lot of stress due to her father's health condition, which may have contributed to her driving behavior. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factors of taking the turn too fast and being distracted by the stress and urgency to reach the hospital.
