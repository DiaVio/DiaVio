The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was inattentive and failed to adequately survey the roadway before making a left turn. The driver also failed to recognize that right of way had to be given to oncoming traffic, despite having a green light. Additionally, the driver's attentiveness may have been impaired by the medications ingested that morning.
