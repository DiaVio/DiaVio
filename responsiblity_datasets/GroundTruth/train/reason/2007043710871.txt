The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking left, right, and left again, V1 failed to see V2 approaching and proceeded to make a left turn. This driver's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed that sun-glare and the light color of V2 contributed to his view being obscured. However, sun-glare was coded as an "other environmental factor" and not a direct cause of the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
