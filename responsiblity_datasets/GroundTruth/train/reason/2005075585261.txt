The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. Despite being unfamiliar with the roadway and driving a vehicle he had never driven before, the driver of V1 assumed that V2 would stop at the red light and yield the right-of-way. This false assumption led to V1 proceeding with the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued due to a lack of sleep, which may have impaired his judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the accident. In contrast, the driver of V2 was well-rested and driving a familiar vehicle on a well-known route, indicating that he was likely following traffic rules and not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption of V2's actions and the driver's fatigue.
