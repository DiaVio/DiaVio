The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a right turn. Despite looking to the right and straight ahead, V1 did not look to her left, where V2 (the driver of the Jeep Cherokee) was approaching from. This failure to properly check for oncoming traffic resulted in V1 entering the intersection and being struck by V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make her primarily responsible for the accident.
