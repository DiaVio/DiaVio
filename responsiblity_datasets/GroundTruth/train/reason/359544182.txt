The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed while negotiating a curve. V1's right tires went off the edge of the roadway onto the loose gravel shoulder, causing the driver to lose control. As V1 returned to the roadway, the driver was unable to regain control, crossed over the opposite lane, and ultimately crashed into the embankment on the south side of the drainage ditch. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lanes led to the accident.
