The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and ignored the stop sign, entering the intersection without the right of way. This illegal maneuver of failing to stop for a traffic control device (the stop sign) led to the collision with V2 (the Aston Martin) and subsequently caused a chain reaction involving the parked vehicles (V3, V4, and V5). V2, on the other hand, stopped at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection after a brief pause. The obstruction caused by the parked delivery van limited V2's visibility, but V2 followed the proper procedure by stopping and proceeding cautiously. Therefore, V2 cannot be primarily held responsible for the accident.
