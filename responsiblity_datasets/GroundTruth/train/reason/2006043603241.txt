The reason for this is that V2 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. V2 stated that V1 suddenly stopped without warning and that he was only able to "barely bump" the back of V1. This indicates that V2 was not able to react in time to the slowing traffic ahead, suggesting that he was following too closely. Additionally, V2 reported that V1 did not use a turn signal or have brake lights on before stopping, which further supports the argument that V2 was not maintaining a safe following distance. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe following distance and respond to the unexpected actions of V1 makes him primarily responsible for the crash.
