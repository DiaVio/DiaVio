The reason for this is that the case vehicle attempted to merge into the inside lane but struck the right side of V2, causing a sideswipe impact. This initial impact led to a counterclockwise yaw, causing the case vehicle to depart the roadway, strike a curb, and ultimately collide with a tree. The case vehicle's actions of merging improperly and causing the initial sideswipe impact indicate its primary responsibility for the accident.
