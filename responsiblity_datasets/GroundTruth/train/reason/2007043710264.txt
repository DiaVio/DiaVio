The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 made an inadequate surveillance error by not seeing V1 approaching at a high rate of speed. This failure to properly observe the oncoming vehicle and accurately assess the situation led to V2 turning left in front of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by talking to his nephew and having other young relatives in the back seats who were also talking, which likely contributed to his failure to see V1. Furthermore, the driver of V2 was driving with a revoked license, which indicates a disregard for traffic laws and safety. Overall, V2's failure to properly observe the oncoming vehicle, being distracted, and driving with a revoked license make them primarily responsible for the accident.
