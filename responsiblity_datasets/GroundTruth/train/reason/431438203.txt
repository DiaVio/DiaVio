The reason for this is that V1 was traveling westbound in the right lane and failed to avoid the collision with V2, the New Flyer Transit Bus, which was stopped and discharging passengers. Despite attempting to brake and steer to the left, V1 was unable to avoid the crash and impacted the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was following too closely or not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision.
