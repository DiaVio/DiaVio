The driver drifted off the edge of the road and then overcorrected, which led to the loss of control of the vehicle. This indicates a lack of proper attention and control on the part of the driver, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a seatbelt suggests a failure to take necessary safety precautions.
