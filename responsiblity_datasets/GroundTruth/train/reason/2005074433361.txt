The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a physical impairment induced by a partial low blood sugar blackout while driving in rush hour traffic. This impairment likely caused the driver to fail to notice traffic slowing down and swerve left to avoid collision with vehicles ahead. The witness statement also supports this, as they saw V1's brake lights while it was in a slight counterclockwise yaw. Additionally, the driver of V1 has high blood pressure and takes medication for both migraine and high blood pressure conditions. The caution on the migraine medication recommends that it not be taken by people at risk of heart disease, as indicated by high blood pressure, obesity, or diabetes. This suggests that the driver's medical conditions and medication may have contributed to the physical impairment and subsequent accident.
