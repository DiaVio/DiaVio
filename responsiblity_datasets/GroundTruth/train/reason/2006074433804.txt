The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V1. V2 noticed V1 and attempted to brake when realizing that there was insufficient clearance to complete the turn before V1 reached the intersection, but was unable to avoid the crash. This indicates that V2 failed to accurately assess the distance and speed of oncoming traffic, leading to the collision.
