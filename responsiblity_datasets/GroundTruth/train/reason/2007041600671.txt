The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 105 KMPH (65 MPH) in lane three, which was above the posted speed limit. When the vehicle in front of V1 came to a stop, the driver of V1 was unable to stop in time due to the wet road conditions and rear-ended V2. The driver of V1 also mentioned a sightline restriction caused by a non-contact truck that had initially been traveling in front of V1, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to react in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others, failure to use due care, and driving above the posted speed limit in adverse weather conditions.
