The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 24 kmph (15 mph) over the speed limit and lost control of the vehicle while entering a right curve. This indicates that the driver was driving too fast for the curve/turn, which was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver failed to look far enough ahead, was speeding, and made a combination of insufficient steering and braking inputs. These factors contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and ultimately led to the crash.
