The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one, a sixteen-year-old male, was making a left turn from the third lane, which is a left turn lane. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to Vehicle one and coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle one failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction-over left lane line." This suggests that Vehicle two was in its designated lane and did not encroach into the path of Vehicle one. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance while making a left turn.
