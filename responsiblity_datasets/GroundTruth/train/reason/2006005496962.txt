The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep behind the wheel, which was identified as the critical pre-crash event. This resulted in V1 crossing over the double yellow lines and encroaching into the eastbound lane, directly into the path of Vehicle two (V2). Although V2 attempted to steer to the right to avoid the collision, V1's failure to negotiate the curve and crossing into the opposite lane made it impossible for V2 to avoid the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle due to falling asleep is the main factor that led to the crash.
