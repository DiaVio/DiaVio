The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which is a driver-related factor. The driver's fatigue, caused by working long hours and experiencing jet lag from a recent job assignment in a different time zone, likely contributed to him falling asleep at the wheel. Additionally, the driver mentioned that he did not sleep well at the hotel and his sleep schedule had not yet adjusted since returning from the job assignment. These factors indicate that the driver was not in a suitable condition to operate the vehicle safely, leading to the crash.
