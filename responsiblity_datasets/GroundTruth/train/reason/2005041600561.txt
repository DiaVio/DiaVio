The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a false assumption that the driver of Vehicle #2 (the 1995 Toyota Corolla) was signaling him to continue turning when she activated her horn. This false assumption led to the driver of Vehicle #1 proceeding into the intersection, resulting in a collision with the front of Vehicle #2. Additionally, Vehicle #1 was issued a ticket for not yielding the right-of-way, further indicating their responsibility in the accident.
