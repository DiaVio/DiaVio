The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they lost traction and control of their vehicle while entering the curve leading to the intersection. Despite attempting to regain control with steering and braking inputs, V1 was unable to regain control before crossing into opposite traffic and striking V2 (the driver of the Lexus GS300). V1's loss of control can be attributed to the poor road conditions, specifically the heavy rain and wet/slick roads. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was identified as "vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions," with the critical reason being "too fast for conditions - slick roads due to rain." These factors indicate that V1 was driving too fast for the slippery road conditions, which ultimately led to the loss of control and the subsequent collision with V2. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was identified as "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over right lane line." However, no critical reason was coded to V2, indicating that their actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adjust their driving behavior to the slick road conditions caused by heavy rain.
