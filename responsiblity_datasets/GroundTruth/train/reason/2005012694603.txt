The driver was traveling at a high rate of speed and was all over all four lanes of travel, running vehicles off the road and almost making contact with another witness's vehicle. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with the fact that the driver was under the influence of illegal drugs (opiates, cocaine) and prescription medications (antidepressant and muscle relaxant), indicates a lack of control and impaired judgment. Additionally, the driver's statement about being in a relaxed state due to the medication and not remembering anything further supports the conclusion that V1 was responsible for the crash. Overall, the driver's aggressive driving, impaired state due to drugs and medication, and lack of control led to the vehicle departing the roadway, causing damage to the traffic light pole, fire hydrant, bush, and sign, and ultimately coming to a rest in front of a building.
