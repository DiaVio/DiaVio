The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the traffic control signal at the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1. This is evident from the Critical Pre-crash Event for V2, which was coded as "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection." Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as an unknown reason, but an associated factor coded to the driver was a Decision Factor, an illegal maneuver, as he disregarded the traffic control signal.
