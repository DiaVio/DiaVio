The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance, as the driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead before initiating her left turn. This driver error led to V1 turning left in front of V2 (the Dodge Neon), causing the collision. Additionally, an associated factor was the driver of V1 listening to the radio, which could have been a possible distraction.
