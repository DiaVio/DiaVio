The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was observed by a witness as traveling around 45 mph and not slowing down at all prior to entering the intersection without stopping at the stop sign. - V1 was driving with its high beam lights flashing, which may have impaired the visibility of other drivers. - The Critical Pre-crash Event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V1 was the one who violated the right of way. - V1's blood alcohol level was found to be .205, indicating that the driver was under the influence of alcohol, which likely impaired their judgment and ability to operate the vehicle safely. - Additional associated factors coded to V1 included a pre-existing medical condition of post-traumatic stress disorder, aggressive driving, and the false assumption that the flashing high beams would signal their right of way. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
