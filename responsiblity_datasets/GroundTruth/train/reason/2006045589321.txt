The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V1 stated that she stopped at the stop sign, looked right then left, and proceeded across the intersection. However, her view of eastbound traffic was obstructed by several legally parked vehicles on the west side of the southbound road, as well as the rising sun causing glare. This obstructed view, combined with the driver's unknown vision problem and the fact that she takes aspirin every day, likely contributed to her inadequate surveillance of the intersection. On the other hand, V2 (the 1997 Ford F-150) reported that the other vehicle "came out of nowhere." While V2 had a vehicle sightline restriction due to the intersection layout, this alone does not make V2 primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to an inadequate surveillance of the intersection, obstructed view, and sun glare impairing vision.
