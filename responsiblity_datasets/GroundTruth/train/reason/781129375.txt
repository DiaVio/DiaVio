The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 crossed the centerlines while entering a sweeping right curve, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Despite attempting to steer right and brake, the vehicle left the roadway and ultimately crashed into a house. This suggests that the driver was unable to navigate the curve safely, leading to the accident.
