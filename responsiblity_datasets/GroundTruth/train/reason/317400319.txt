The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center lane line, causing the collision with V1. V1, the Chrysler 300 sedan, attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and locking its brakes, indicating that the driver of V1 took evasive action to prevent the accident. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for crossing the center lane line and causing the collision.
