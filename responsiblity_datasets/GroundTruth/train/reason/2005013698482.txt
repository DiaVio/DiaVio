The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn into a driveway, which was coded as the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1. However, V1 made a recognition error and failed to see any oncoming vehicles before initiating the turn. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2. On the other hand, V2 (the 35-year-old male driving the Chevy Tahoe) was traveling within the speed limit and did not exhibit any critical reasons for the crash. V2 stated that he saw V1 but did not anticipate her turning in front of him, and by the time he realized it, it was too late to react. Therefore, V1's failure to properly recognize the oncoming vehicle and yield the right of way makes her primarily responsible for the crash.
