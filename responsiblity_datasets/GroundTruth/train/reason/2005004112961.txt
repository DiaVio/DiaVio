The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically in rainy and wet road conditions. This is evident from the driver's statement that she was driving straight when her vehicle suddenly lost control and struck a curb. Additionally, the driver admitted to being uncomfortable driving the powerful vehicle and being inexperienced. These factors, combined with the presence of a construction work zone and wet roads, contribute to the driver's decision error of traveling too fast for the conditions.
