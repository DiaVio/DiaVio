The reason for this is that V1 ran a red light at the intersection, indicating aggressive driving. The driver of V1 assumed that V2 would remain stopped until V1 passed through the intersection, which was a false assumption. This failure to obey traffic signals and make a correct judgment led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported being fatigued from long work hours and having family concerns, which may have contributed to a lack of focus and impaired decision-making. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light and making a false assumption about the actions of V2.
