The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and focused on other cars, specifically an oncoming car turning left in front of her. This distraction caused her to not notice V2 approaching the intersection in the westbound direction. As a result, V1 proceeded to turn left without yielding to V2, leading to the collision.
