The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V1 when entering the straight portion of the road where it merged with the collector lane. V2 lost control of the vehicle, left the roadway, and then re-entered the roadway, ultimately striking the back of V1. V2's loss of control and excessive speed for the curve on the ramp are the main factors contributing to the crash.
