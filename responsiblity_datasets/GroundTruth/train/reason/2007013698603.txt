The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event and Critical Reason coded for V1, which indicate that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. Additionally, the driver's statement that he tried to steer left to correct while braking but could not regain control further supports the fact that he was driving too fast for the conditions. Furthermore, an associated factor of internal distraction was mentioned, as the driver was smoking at the time of the crash. While this may have contributed to the driver's inability to regain control, the primary responsibility still lies with V1 for driving too fast for the icy road conditions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the icy road conditions.
