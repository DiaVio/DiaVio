The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was negotiating a right curve on a wet roadway in blowing snow and traveled left across the center line, ultimately departing the left side of the road and impacting a tree. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered into oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with the tree.
