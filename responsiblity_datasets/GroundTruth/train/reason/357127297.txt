The reason for this is that the injuries sustained by the driver, such as the lacerations, contusions, and subluxation, are all consistent with the driver being unrestrained and moving forward and inboard relative to the vehicle interior during the severe frontal impact. This suggests that the driver was not properly restrained by a three-point belt, which is a violation of traffic safety regulations. Additionally, the injuries to specific body parts, such as the chin, forehead, and eyebrows, indicate contact with the rearview mirror reinforced by the windshield header, further suggesting that the driver was not properly restrained. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of Vehicle 1 due to their failure to wear a seatbelt, resulting in severe injuries.
