The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without stopping and began its left turn maneuver, failing to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Honda Civic Del Sol). V2 was driving straight in the opposing lane with a green light and did not expect V1 to turn. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering left, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and yield the right of way, combined with their false assumption that V2 would stop, led to the collision.
