The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a glass atrium on a building to the left of the highway. When he redirected his attention to the roadway, he found that traffic ahead was stopped and was unable to avoid a frontal collision with the back of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's external distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road ahead.
