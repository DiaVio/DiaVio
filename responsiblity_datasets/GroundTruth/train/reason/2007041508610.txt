The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a seizure while driving, which resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's pre-existing health condition, history of seizures, and the doubt regarding regular medication intake all contribute to the driver's physical impairment at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver's failure to take any avoidance actions further supports the conclusion that the driver was incapacitated.
