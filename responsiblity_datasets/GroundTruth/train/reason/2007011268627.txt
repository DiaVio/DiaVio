The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 40 mph, which was too fast for the heavy rain conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a decision error by following too closely to allow for unexpected actions of other road users. This is evident from the fact that V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's speed and failure to maintain a safe distance are the main reasons for the accident.
