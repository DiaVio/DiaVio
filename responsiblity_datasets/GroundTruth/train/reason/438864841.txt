The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling northwest on a two-lane, two-way road and failed to stop or slow down in time to avoid colliding with Vehicle 2 (the 2009 Honda Accord), which was stopped in traffic ahead of Vehicle 1, waiting to turn left into a parking lot. The front of Vehicle 1 impacted the back of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 was following too closely or not paying attention to the traffic ahead. This failure to maintain a safe distance or exercise proper caution resulted in the rear-end collision and subsequent injuries to the occupant of Vehicle 1.
