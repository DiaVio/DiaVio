The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was turning left across the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1989 Toyota Camry Deluxe) at a 3-leg intersection. Vehicle 2 was proceeding straight in the outboard lane of a multi-lane urban roadway. Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
