The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound and attempted to turn left at the intersection, which means they were required to yield to oncoming traffic. V1 (the Nissan Altima) was traveling westbound in lane one and had the right of way. V2 disregarded the stop sign and turned left, resulting in the front of V1 contacting the front of V2. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and disregard of the stop sign led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
