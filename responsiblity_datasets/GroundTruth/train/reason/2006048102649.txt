The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that V2 (the Cadillac Deville) was stopped in front of them. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not adequately observe their surroundings and failed to notice the stopped vehicle in front of them. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and notice the stopped vehicle ahead resulted in the collision with V2, which subsequently caused V2 to collide with V3.
