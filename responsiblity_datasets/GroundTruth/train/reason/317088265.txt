The reason for this is that V2 was reportedly traveling at a high speed of approximately 129 kph (80 mph) while responding to an emergency call. V2 swerved onto the left shoulder of the roadway to pass a stopped vehicle in the left lane, and upon reentering the roadway, it struck V1 in the left rear door. This initial impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and subsequently collide with V3. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 due to its excessive speed and unsafe maneuvering while responding to an emergency call.
