The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, veering left across four lanes of traffic and making contact with the right side of V2 (the Chevy Monte Carlo). This action caused V1 to begin rotating in a clockwise direction and ultimately resulted in V1 rolling onto the inside emergency lane and colliding with the concrete traffic barrier. While V2's driver noticed V1's erratic movements and attempted to avoid the collision by letting off the gas pedal, it was ultimately V1's loss of control and subsequent actions that led to the accident. Additionally, the presence of tire deficiencies in V1, with one severely overinflated and the other severely underinflated, may have contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's loss of control and overcompensation, as well as the tire deficiencies.
