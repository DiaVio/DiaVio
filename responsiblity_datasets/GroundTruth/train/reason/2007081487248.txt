The reason for this is that V1 made an incorrect evasive maneuver by swerving into the HOV lane to avoid a non-contact vehicle and then swerving back into the right lane, where V2 (the 1986 Ford Ranger pickup) was stopped in traffic. V1 should have brought the vehicle to a controlled stop in lane 3 instead of returning to lane two. It is important to note that the driver of V2 was unable to be reached for an interview, so their pre-crash factors are unknown.
