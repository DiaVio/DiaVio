The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to merge into the second lane without seeing the non-contact vehicle occupying that lane. This indicates a failure to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes. Additionally, when warned by a passenger, the driver overcompensated and lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with a light pole. This suggests a lack of proper control and reaction to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to check for other vehicles and poor directional control.
