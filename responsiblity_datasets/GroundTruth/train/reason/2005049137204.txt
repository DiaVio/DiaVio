The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet C10 Pick-up) entered the roadway from the right shoulder directly in front of V1, and V1 was unable to respond in time to avoid the impact. Additionally, the presence of alcohol and cocaine in V1's system would have affected their reaction time and ability to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and impaired state contributed to the accident, making them primarily responsible.
