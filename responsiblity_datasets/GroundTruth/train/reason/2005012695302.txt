The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize that V2 (the driver of the Buick Park Avenue) had come to a stop and collided with the rear of V2. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a recognition error and inattention on the part of V1, as he was thinking about the driver's test he had just taken and his upcoming job application. Additionally, V1 claimed that his brakes felt soft and his foot went to the floor, suggesting a possible vehicle-related problem of brake failure. However, during the vehicle inspection, no brake problem was found. On the other hand, V2 was stopped and intending to make a left turn, which is a normal and legal maneuver. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as another vehicle in the lane traveling with a higher speed, indicating that V1 was the vehicle traveling at a higher speed and failed to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of him. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to his recognition error, inattention, and failure to stop in time to avoid colliding with the rear of V2.
