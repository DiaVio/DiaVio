The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to pay attention to the road and the vehicles in front of her. Despite there being enough distance for her to see the stopped vehicles and slow down accordingly, she did not realize that the vehicles in front of her were stopped. This lack of attention and failure to recognize the stopped vehicles led to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1999 Ford Ranger) also bears some responsibility for the crash as he was in a hurry to get to a social event and may not have been fully attentive to the road. However, V1's failure to recognize the stopped vehicles and take appropriate action is the primary reason for the crash.
