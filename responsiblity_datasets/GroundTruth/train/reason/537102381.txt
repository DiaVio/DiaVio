The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. As V1 was traveling in the northbound through-lane and V2 was approaching the intersection from the eastbound lane, V2 should have yielded to V1. Therefore, V2 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
