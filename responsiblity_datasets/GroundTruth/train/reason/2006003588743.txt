The driver of Vehicle #2 disregarded the traffic control signal and failed to stop at the intersection, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #1 (the Ford F-550 tow truck). This is evident from the critical pre-crash event coded for Vehicle #2, which indicates that the vehicle was traveling and crossing over the intersection. The critical reason for this event was identified as an illegal maneuver, a driver-related error. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
