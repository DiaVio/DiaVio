The reason for this is that the driver of V2 reportedly fell asleep while driving, which resulted in both vehicles entering the intersection at the same time. As a result, V1 was unable to avoid striking V2, leading to the collision. Falling asleep while driving is considered negligent behavior and a violation of traffic laws, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
