The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at a stop sign and proceeded into the intersection without ensuring that the way was clear. The driver of V1 stated that there was another vehicle in lane one of the eastbound lanes obstructing her view, but she did not recall this vehicle at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 suffered a concussion and was unconscious for several minutes after the crash, which may have affected her ability to accurately recall the events. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and proceed safely into the intersection makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
