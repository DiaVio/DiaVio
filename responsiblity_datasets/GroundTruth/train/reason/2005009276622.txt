The driver stated that he lost control of the car while traversing a curve at a constant rate of speed due to the wet road conditions. He mentioned that he started sliding left and right and was unable to regain control of the vehicle, resulting in it striking a telephone pole. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was the loss of control due to traveling too fast for the wet conditions. The critical reason for this critical pre-crash event was a decision error, specifically driving too fast for the rainy conditions. Therefore, Vehicle 1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision to drive at an unsafe speed given the wet and rainy weather conditions.
