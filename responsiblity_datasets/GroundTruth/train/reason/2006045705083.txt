The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was driving aggressively, possibly speeding, and made an inappropriate and unsuccessful evasive maneuver. The driver of Vehicle #1 swerved to the left to avoid a non-contact vehicle that was stopped in the westbound lane, but failed to see Vehicle #2 approaching in the eastbound lane. As a result, Vehicle #1 collided with Vehicle #2, causing it to roll over. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle #1 was an inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to their inability to handle the situation appropriately.
