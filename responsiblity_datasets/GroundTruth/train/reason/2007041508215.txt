The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed over the right lane line multiple times, making contact with the left side of V2 (the white Toyota Corolla). This indicates poor directional control and a driver-related performance error on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being lost and distracted by thoughts about missing her doctor's appointment, which suggests driver inattention. The driver of V1 also mentioned having pre-existing health conditions and taking medications, which could have potentially affected her ability to control the vehicle. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in the slow lane and took precautions due to not having a driver's license. The driver of V2 stated that she did not see any cars near her when she looked to her left before the collision. This suggests that V2 was driving responsibly and was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's poor directional control, driver inattention, and crossing over the lane line multiple times.
