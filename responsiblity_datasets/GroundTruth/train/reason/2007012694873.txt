The reason for this is that the driver crossed the centerline, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the driver overcorrected multiple times, leading to a loss of control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event was determined to be the vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, suggesting that the driver was driving at an unsafe speed for the roadway conditions. Furthermore, the critical reason for the critical event was coded as "inattention," indicating that the driver was not fully focused on the task of driving. The presence of an unknown distraction further supports this conclusion. Overall, the driver's failure to maintain lane position, overcorrection, and inattention to driving are the primary factors that led to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
