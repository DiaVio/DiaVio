The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to negotiate the curve and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a concrete wall. This indicates poor directional control on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver's health conditions and medications may have contributed to his ability to safely operate the vehicle. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact cause of the driver's poor directional control.
