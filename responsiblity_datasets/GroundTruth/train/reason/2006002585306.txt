The reason for this is that V1 drifted into the driving lane, striking V2 (the Freightliner) on its left side. V1 then corrected to the left onto the left shoulder, corrected back to the right, and crossed both lanes before being struck by the front of V2. V1's poor directional control and failure to maintain its lane led to the collision with V2. Additionally, factors such as the driver's conversation with her husband and potential distraction, as well as her vision impairment and use of prescription medication, may have contributed to her inability to control the vehicle properly.
