The reason for this is that Vehicle one was engaged in an illegal maneuver by turning left from the first lane, which is not allowed. Additionally, witnesses at the scene reported that Vehicle one was driving at a high speed, aggressively changing lanes, and swerving around traffic. This reckless behavior indicates a disregard for traffic laws and safety. On the other hand, Vehicle two (1998 Ford Taurus) was driving at a normal traffic speed of 56 kph (35 mph) and did not appear to brake before the collision. This suggests that Vehicle two was following the rules of the road and did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the collision due to their illegal maneuver and reckless driving behavior.
