The reason for this is that Vehicle one was traveling behind Vehicle two (2004 Ford Expedition SUV) and failed to stop in time, resulting in a rear-end collision. The critical reason for the accident was coded as "internal distraction" for Vehicle one, indicating that the driver was not paying attention and may have been distracted. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle one was reaching for a cell phone, which further supports the conclusion that their inattention led to the collision.
