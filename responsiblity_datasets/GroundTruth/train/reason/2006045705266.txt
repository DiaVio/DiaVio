The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the 1998 Toyota Camry) while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. This misjudgment led to V1 being impacted on the right side near the back by V2's front. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, which could have contributed to the misjudgment. While V2 may have encroached over the left lane line, this action alone does not attribute primary responsibility to V2. The critical reason for the crash was not coded to V2, and no other contributing actions were attributed to V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment and inexperience.
