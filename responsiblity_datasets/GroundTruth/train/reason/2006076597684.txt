The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made several errors that directly contributed to the loss of control and subsequent rollover of the vehicle. These errors include: 1. Inadequate experience and discomfort with towing a large trailer: The driver admitted to having limited experience with a trailer of this size and stated that he was uncomfortable towing it. Lack of experience and discomfort can lead to poor judgment and decision-making while operating the vehicle. 2. Failure to use trailer brakes when the trailer began to sway: When the driver noticed the trailer swinging side to side, instead of using the trailer brakes to control the sway, he chose to accelerate in an attempt to straighten it out. This action increased the speed and worsened the sway, exacerbating the loss of control. 3. Poor directional control: The driver's attempt to control the trailer by jamming on the brakes further destabilized the vehicle, causing it to jackknife and ultimately roll over. This indicates a lack of proper control and handling of the vehicle in a critical situation. Overall, the driver's lack of experience, poor decision-making, and failure to properly control the vehicle and trailer directly contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rollover.
