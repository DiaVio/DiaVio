The reason for this is that V2 cut off V1 while it was negotiating a curve, causing V1 to swerve right and lose control of the vehicle. V1's driver stated that she was traveling at a reasonable speed and was familiar with the area, indicating that her actions were not the primary cause of the crash. Additionally, the police officer conducted a field sobriety test, which the driver passed, suggesting that alcohol or impairment was not a factor in the crash. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for making an unsafe maneuver and cutting off V1.
