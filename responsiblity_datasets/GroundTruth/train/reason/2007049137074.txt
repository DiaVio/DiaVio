The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically too fast for the curve/turn of the exit ramp. The physical evidence does not support the driver's claim that another vehicle cut him off, and the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. Additionally, the driver had missed his exit and attempted to exit anyway, which further indicates driver error and responsibility for the crash.
