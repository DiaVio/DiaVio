The driver of V1 was a 17-year old female who had backed out of her driveway and started traveling west down the street. She skidded off the road to the right and contacted a phone box and a utility pole. The critical pre-crash event was coded as poor directional control, indicating that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Factors associated with this driver include the icy road conditions, driver inexperience, and inattention. Additionally, it was reported that the driver did not have a valid driver's license, only a permit. It was believed that she panicked as the vehicle started to slide and did not know how to keep the vehicle under control. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the contributing factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
