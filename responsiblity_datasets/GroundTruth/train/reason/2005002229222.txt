The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being inattentive and possibly glancing away or spacing out prior to the crash. This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver, as they failed to realize that the vehicles ahead had moved forward and stopped. Additionally, the driver could not recall their speed at the time of the impact, suggesting a lack of awareness of their surroundings. Therefore, Vehicle #1's driver's inattention and recognition error are the primary factors contributing to the crash.
