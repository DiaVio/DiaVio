The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions. The roadway was a gravel road with a downhill grade, and the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver admitted to feeling fatigued and stressed, which likely contributed to his poor directional control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adapt to the road conditions, lack of skill in controlling the vehicle, and his own fatigue and distraction.
