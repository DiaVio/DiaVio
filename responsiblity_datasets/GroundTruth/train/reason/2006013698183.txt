The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that she looked to see if there were any cars coming before making her left turn, but she failed to see the oncoming car in the right curb lane. This indicates that she did not adequately check for oncoming traffic before making her turn, leading to the collision with V2.
