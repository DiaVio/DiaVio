The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic control device. This failure to stop resulted in V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2 (the 1990 Cadillac DeVille). While V2 did observe V1 approaching the stop sign and attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering left, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not obeying the traffic control device.
