The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that it crossed over the left lane line into the eastbound lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2 (1985 Kawasaki motorcycle). This action by Vehicle #1 indicates a failure to maintain their lane and resulted in the crash. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #1 was "This Vehicle Traveling Over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," and the Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was "Driver Related Factor False Assumption of Other Actions." These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a false assumption about the actions of Vehicle #2, which led to the decision to cross into the eastbound lane. While Vehicle #2 was cited for not having a motorcycle license, it is important to note that no Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded to this vehicle. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 due to its failure to maintain its lane and the false assumption made by its driver.
