The reason for this is that V2 stopped in the westbound lane and began to back into a driveway on the south side of the roadway, partially angling the trailer across the eastbound lane. This action created a hazardous situation where the front of V1, the 2007 Toyota Prius, impacted the left side of the trailer. V2's improper backing maneuver and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
