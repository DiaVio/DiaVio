The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield at the intersection, which is indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as a driver-related factor: illegal maneuver. The witness behind V1 also stated that V1 kept pulling into the intersection while V2 was making the turn. Although V2 (the driver of the International truck pulling a trailer) was also coded for traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, the critical reason for this event was not attributed to V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and encroachment into the intersection is the primary cause of the accident.
