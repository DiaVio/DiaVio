The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn into the path of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Nissan Sentra sedan). V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 before entering the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
