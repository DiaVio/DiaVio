The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling southbound and collided with the disabled V2 (2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse) that was already stopped and blocking half of the number-four lane. V1's driver was unable to react in time to avoid the collision, indicating a failure to maintain proper control and awareness of the road ahead.
