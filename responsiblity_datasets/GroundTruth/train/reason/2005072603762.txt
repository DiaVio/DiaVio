The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 97-105 kmph (60-65 mph), which is above the speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). This indicates that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the road, which ultimately led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's statement about the steering failure and the vehicle responding as if the alignment was defective suggests that the driver was not able to handle the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, further supporting the driver-related factor of poor directional control.
