The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded through the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. This illegal maneuver by V1 directly led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road, which further contributed to the accident.
