The driver of V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the 1999 Toyota Sienna) at the red light, resulting in the front of V1 striking the back of V2. The driver of V1 admitted that he applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time due to the wet roadways and leaves on the ground, which reduced the friction and prevented him from stopping. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident because they were traveling too fast for the conditions and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them.
