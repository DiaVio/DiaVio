The reason for this is that V1 was the one who failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2) making a left turn. This lack of attention and failure to yield to the turning vehicle resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to the oncoming vehicle makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
