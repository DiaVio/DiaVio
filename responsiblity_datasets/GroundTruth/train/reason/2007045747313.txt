The driver of V1 admitted to drag racing with an unknown vehicle in lane two, which indicates reckless and aggressive behavior. Additionally, the driver stated that he was traveling at a high speed of 125 kmph (85 mph), which was too fast for the conditions of the road, especially considering the construction zone. These factors, along with the driver's loss of control and inability to regain control of the vehicle, demonstrate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
