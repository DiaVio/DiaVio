The reason for this is that V2, the Pontiac Grand Prix, was traveling behind V1, the Nissan Altima, and failed to maintain a safe distance. As V1 slowed down to make a left turn, V2 collided with the back of V1. This indicates that V2 was not able to stop in time or failed to react appropriately to the slowing vehicle in front of them. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V2 was coded as an unknown driver error, suggesting that the driver of V2 made a mistake or error that led to the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and their unknown driver error.
