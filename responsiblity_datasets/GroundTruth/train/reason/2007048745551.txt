The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a nineteen-year-old female, was experiencing driver-related factors such as poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." Additionally, the driver's fatigue, as she had been awake for more than twenty-one hours at the time of the crash, was an associated factor in the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and fatigue.
