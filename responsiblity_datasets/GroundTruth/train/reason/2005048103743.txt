The driver of V1 was found to have several contributing factors that led to the crash. These factors include: 1. Blacking out just before the crash: The driver stated that he blacked out, indicating a loss of consciousness, which would have impaired his ability to control the vehicle. 2. Consumption of alcohol: The driver admitted to consuming two drinks of bourbon and two beers prior to the crash. This indicates that he was driving under the influence, which significantly impairs judgment, coordination, and reaction time. 3. Fatigue: The driver was extremely fatigued due to his 65-hour-per-week work schedule and having had no sleep in the past 24 hours. Fatigue can impair cognitive function and reaction time, making it dangerous to operate a vehicle. 4. Medications: The driver was taking a mixture of sedatives, tranquillizers, and anti-depressants at the time of the crash. These medications can cause drowsiness and impair driving ability. 5. BAC test result: The driver had a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) test result of 0.34, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This indicates a high level of alcohol impairment. Considering these factors, it is clear that the driver of V1 was not in a condition to safely operate a vehicle. His blacking out, consumption of alcohol, extreme fatigue, and medication use all contributed to his inability to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
