The driver of V1 was distracted and failed to look far enough ahead, resulting in a rear-end collision with V2 (the 1998 Mercury Sable). This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event for V1, which states that there was another vehicle in the same lane that was stopped, and the Critical Reason, which indicates an internal distraction. Additionally, V1 was the vehicle that initiated the chain reaction by hitting the back of V2 and pushing it forward into V3 (the 1997 Plymouth Breeze).
