This near side impact crash case involves a 56 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with deployed side and curtain air bags who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a T- intersection. The intersection is comprised of one north and one southbound lane, intersecting with a two lane roadway consisting of one east and one westbound travel lane. This intersection is controlled by a stop sign for westbound vehicles. Both roadways are comprised of asphalt and in the area where the crash occurred, there is a slight uphill grade for northbound vehicles. The westbound lane has a slight downhill grade, but the travel lanes level out where the roadways intersect. At the time of the crash it was raining and the lanes were wet. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Ford Focus four door sedan, was stopped in the westbound lane, waiting to make a left turn at the intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1991 Toyota Camry four door sedan, was traveling north in lane one on the intersecting street. V1 began to turn left as V2 entered the intersection. Both drivers braked, but the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the actuation of V1's left front seat belt buckle pretensioner and the deployment of V1's driver's side air bag and side curtain. V1 was pushed northbound as it rotated clockwise and came to final rest on the north side of the intersection, facing west. V2 came to final rest near V1, facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 56 year old female driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the crash, this case occupant's seat back mounted side air bag and left roof side rail mounted curtain air bag both deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
