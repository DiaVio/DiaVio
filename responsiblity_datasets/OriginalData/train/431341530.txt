The case involves a 90-year-old female case occupant 152 cm (5'0") tall and weighing 50 kg (110 pounds). The case occupant was the front right passenger in a 2007 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan involved in a severe frontal crash with a large size truck. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. The case occupant was not properly restrained by the available 3-point manual belt but did have a frontal air bag available to her, which deployed as a result of the crash. On impact, the case occupant moved forward in relationship to the vehicle contacting the intruding windshield with her head as evidenced by facial lacerations and a scalp avulsion. Her head contact with the windshield also resulted in a cerebral concussion. The case occupant also contacted the right instrument panel resulting in multiple rib fractures (Right #5-7) and bilateral lung contusions. The case occupant contacted the glove compartment door with her right knee and center lower instrument panel with her left knee resulting in a proximal femur fracture and distal femur fracture, respectively. The knee contacts with the glove compartment resulted in bilateral knee abrasions. The left knee contact also resulted in an acetabulum fracture. The patient died as a result of pulmonary failure.
