This single vehicle crash occurred on a holiday during early morning daylight hours. The location was a five lane divided (with a positive barrier) right curved (radius of curvature unknown) concrete roadway. It was an uphill (slope unknown) highway. The weather was clear and the roads dry. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 96 kph (60 mph). It was not morning rush hour and there was unusual low traffic on the roadways. Lane one of the roadway was an exit lane only leading to an exit ramp. There were temporary signs indicating a work zone ahead.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Mitsubishi Galant, with one occupant, was traveling north in the fourth lane of the roadway. V1 initiated a clockwise yaw as it crossed lanes 3,2 and 1 and departed the roadway to the right. The front of V1 struck a luminaire as it continued to rotate. The left side of the vehicle struck a temporary work sign as the vehicle came to rest facing east in the sod roadside. The vehicle was towed from the scene. The driver was not injured. Yaw marks identified the path of the vehicle after it departed lane four. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

A 23-year old female was the driver of V1. She was well rested, in good health and does not take any medication. She was heading to her mother's residence from her own home, using this roadway for the first time ever. She bought the vehicle used 17 days prior to the crash and had been driving it on a daily basis. The fact that she was traveling on this roadway for the first time ever and the unusual low traffic this day indicates the driver saw the exit a little too late and steered in the direction of the exit too abruptly.

The critical pre-crash event was coded "this vehicle traveling - off the edge of the road on the right side." The critical reason was coded "driver related factor - poor directional control." The directional loss of control occurred when the driver attempted to get to an exit ramp from lane four at highway speed.
