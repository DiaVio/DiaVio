This interrupted rollover crash involves a 22 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a frontal air bag deployment. He sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way north/south roadway, during the pre-dawn hours, in darkness, under cloudy weather and dry roadway conditions. There are no curbs on either side of the travel lanes and on the east side of the road there is a narrow dirt shoulder, followed by a ditch and an embankment. In V1's precrash area, the southbound lane is level and curves to the right. Vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, was traveling south in lane one. As V1 entered the curve, it continued traveling straight ahead and departed the roadway to the left. V1's front impacted the embankment, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of his frontal air bag. V1 rotated counterclockwise as it continued traveling south through uneven and swampy terrain. Then V1 began to trip and rollover to the right. As V1 began to rollover, its right side impacted a tree, shearing the tree off its base and resulting in the deployment of the right side curtain air bag. V1 continued rolling over and its top back impacted another tree, shearing off that tree as well. V1 completed a second quarter turn and its top impacted a large rock. V1 came to final rest on its top, facing southeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 22 year old male, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and his steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the crash. The right roof side rail mounted curtain air bag also deployed during the crash. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
