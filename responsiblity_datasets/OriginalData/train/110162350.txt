The focus of this case is on a 26-year old female who was the restrained right front passenger (case occupant) of a 2006 Infiniti G35 2 door coupe (V1) involved in a frontal impact crash with a tree. For an unknown reason, V1 departed the road to the right and contacted a large tree with the front plane of the vehicle. This single vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours (dark) of a spring weekday on a curved level section of a two-lane roadway. This bituminous roadway runs North and South. The weather was rainy and the roadway surface was wet. The speed limit for the East/West roadway is 40 km/h (25 mph). The driver of V1 was traveling in the northbound travel lane. He was wearing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag. The 26 year old female right front passenger (case occupant) was wearing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had an advanced frontal impact air bag available. For unknown reasons, V1 departed the roadway to the right and impacted a large tree adjacent to the right shoulder of the northbound travel lane. V1's driver frontal impact air bag deployed, but the passenger frontal air bag did not deploy. V1 remained against the large tree coming to rest pointing in a northeasterly direction. The driver of V1 and the right front passenger (case occupant) were removed from the vehicle and transported by ground rescue to a local hospital with serious injuries. The case occupant was then transferred by ground, due to inclimate weather conditions, to a trauma center due to the more serious nature of her injuries. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
