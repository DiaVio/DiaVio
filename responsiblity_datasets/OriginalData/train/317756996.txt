This case involves an unrestrained 58 year old male driver in a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags and dual side curtains. The frontal steering wheel mounted airbag and the frontal passenger instrument panel airbag both deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on a dark two-way, two-lane switchback almost 180 degree left curve (switchback curve) roadway with lanes that ran north to south. The southbound lane had a downhill slope. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 56 kph (35 mph) and there were no adverse weather conditions. V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane approaching the switchback left curve ahead. The driver attempted to brake and steered left in an attempt to slow V1; however, V1 skidded off the right roadside where it contacted a sign with its right side. V1 continued off the roadway and contacted an embankment with its front. After the frontal impact, V1 continued a short distance up the embankment and rolled onto its left side. V1 came to rest on its left side while facing east after rolling only one quarter turn. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by air to a level one trauma center. He was hospitalized and treated for serious injuries he sustained in the crash.
