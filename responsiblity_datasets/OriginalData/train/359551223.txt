This frontal impact crash case involves an 84 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred at dusk on a two lane, two way roadway. The north-south street has one north and one southbound lane, with paved shoulders present on both sides. The lanes are straight, level, comprised of asphalt and there are private residential driveways on either side of the street. At the time of the crash, there were overcast weather conditions and dry travel lanes. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2012 Mazda 3 four door sedan, was facing west, waiting to turn left from a residential driveway. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2001 Ford Ranger compact pickup, was traveling north in lane one, approaching V1's location. V1 began to turn left and entered V2's travel lane, and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's driver side frontal air bag. V1 rotated clockwise, traveled a short distance and came to final rest facing northeast in a grassy area adjacent to the east shoulder. V2 traveled north and came to final rest facing northeast on the grass just north of V1. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene. The case occupant is the 84 year old male driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital where he was treated and released. The following day he returned to the hospital and was later transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
