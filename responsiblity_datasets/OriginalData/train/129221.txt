Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Buick LeSabre, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the left, through-lane of a four lane, two-way road (two southbound lanes, one for right turn only, one for through and left turn and two north bound lanes). Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Chevrolet S-10 extended cab pickup was traveling west in the right westbound through lane of a seven lane, divided trafficway (westbound right turn lane, three westbound through lanes, divided, raised, unprotected grassy median, three eastbound lanes). Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration. V1 rotated clockwise while V2 rotated counter clockwise and the two vehicles had a subsequent side-slap impact involving the left quarter panel of V1 and the right side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 78-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The 75-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt, an OEM seat belt extender, and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. Both occupants were transported to a local hospital with serious and severe injuries, respectively. Both occupants were subsequently transferred to a regional, level-one trauma center.
