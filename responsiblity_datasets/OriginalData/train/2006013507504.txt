This crash occurred in the late evening of a weekend in the wooded center median of divided highway. The north/south highway consisted of two lanes in each direction divided by a wide sunken median. The bituminous highway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph). The roadway at the time of the crash was dark and unlit.

V1, a 1991 Dodge Dynasty was northbound in the right lane being followed by police in active pursuit of V1 for refusing to stop when ordered. Another police vehicle had positioned itself north of V1 on the same roadway and deployed “Stop Sticks” (which flatten the tires of a vehicle so that it will be forced to stop). Before V1 rolled over the deployed stop sticks a Non-contact Vehicle (NCV) traveling in lane one rolled over the stop sticks. The NCV came to a stop partially obstructing lane two. After V1 had its tires damaged by the stop sticks it attempted to avoid the NCV and lost control. V1 traveled off the roadway to the left into the median, where it struck several small trees before contacting a large tree and finally coming to final rest approximately 50m (164 ft.) from where it departed the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
