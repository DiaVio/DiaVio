Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Ford Focus, 4-door hatchback was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix was also traveling east in the eastbound lane and was behind V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 2003 Ford Focus was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V2 was reportedly inattentive and struck the rear of V1. This impact caused V1 to lose control, rotate in a counterclockwise manner, and enter into the westbound lane. The front of V3 struck the right side of V1 in an L-type configuration. There was no evidence as to the final resting positions of the three involved vehicles but V2 was driven from the scene while V1 and V3 were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 79-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries. The 76-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the seatback-mounted head and torso air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
