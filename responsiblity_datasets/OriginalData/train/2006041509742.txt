Case #2006-41-024

The crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-way, two-lane undivided roadway. This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway with a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph). Conditions were dark with streetlights, on a weekday evening. The skies were clear and roads were dry. Traffic flow was normal. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

V1, a 1994 Dodge Dakota pickup truck with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one. The driver drove off the left side of the roadway, striking a utility pole with the front of the vehicle. Bystanders or friends of the driver pulled him out of the vehicle, so that when paramedics and police arrived, they could not determine whether the injured occupant was the driver or a passenger. Therefore, the police report lists the accident as a hit-and-run. It was researcher-determined that the injured person was in fact the driver.

The Dodge Dakota was driven by a 66-year old male, who was transported with incapacitating injuries. The driver declined to be interviewed, stating that he in fact, was not the driver. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side". The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as poor directional control. Specifically, the driver's motor skills were seriously compromised as a result of alcohol ingestion (BAC reported as 0.23). An additional associated factor for this driver may have been sleep apnea since his medical record indicated that he used a C-PAP machine as treatment for this disorder.
