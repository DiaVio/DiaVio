This case involved a 25 year old unrestrained female driver of a 2005 Toyota Corolla four door sedan (V1). V1 was struck in the left side by a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle (V2). V1 was equipped with frontal airbags which did not deploy in the crash. V1 was not equipped with side impact airbags. The crash occurred during daylight hours at a multi-lane intersection. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was eastbound with a 4% downhill grade stopped in the right turn lane waiting to turn right at the intersection. V2 was traveling south in the right through lane of five southbound lanes. V2 began to drift to the right and entered the right turn lane. V2 continued traveling forward and slightly to the right into the intersection. As V2 continued into the intersection the front of V2 struck the left side of V1, pushing V1 into a drainage curb. V1 struck the curb with its right rear wheel and overturned to the right, impacting the concrete drain cover with its hood. V1 continued to roll onto its top for final rest. V2 came to rest just forward of the initial impact. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 received serious injuries in the crash and was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center for treatment.
