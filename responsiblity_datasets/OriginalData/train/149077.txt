Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door wagon was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and allowed his vehicle to drift to the right. The right side wheels of V1 left the paved surface of the road which woke the driver and he steered left. V1 re-entered the road, crossed the centerline and westbound lane, and departed the left side of the road. The driver of V1 then steered right in an attempt to regain control but before V1 re-entering the paved road, the left side of V1 struck and knocked down a wooden mailbox post. The driver of V1 then re-entered the road, crossed the westbound lane and was partialy back into the eastbound lane. The driver then steered back to the left which resulted in the vehicle entering a counterclockwise yaw. V1 continued in this yaw until it departed the left side of the road, where it tripped over its right side wheels on the sod surface of the shoulder. V1 then impacted a tree with its roof, rotated around the tree and came to rest on its right side facing south-southeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 21-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
