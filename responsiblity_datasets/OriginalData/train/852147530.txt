The case occupant is a 33 year old female driver in a head-on frontal collision who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with an actuating retractor pretensioner and a frontal impact air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions on a two lane, two way highway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan, was traveling south in the southbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1996 Ford F350 pickup was traveling north in the northbound lane. Vehicle 3 (V3), a 2000 Ford Taurus four door sedan was traveling north just ahead of V2 and began to slow for traffic. V2 then locked up brakes and swerved to the left and began to depart the lane to avoid V3. The front right of V2 impacted the back left corner of V3 before V2 crossed over the centerline into the southbound lane where the front of V2 struck head-on with case V1. From the point of impact V1 was forced backwards and came to final rest facing southeast with the back of V1 partially off the west road edge. V2 came to final rest facing north/northwest in the southbound lane. All vehicles involved were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 33 year old female driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt and the pretensioner actuated and a front steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
