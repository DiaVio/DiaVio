This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 37-year-old female belted driver, a 43-year-old male belted front right passenger, an 11-year-old female belted rear left passenger, and an 8-year-old male belted rear right passenger of a 2001 Ford Expedition large utility vehicle. This case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal and side airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The frontal airbags deployed as a result of an oblique-angled collision with a 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 2). V1's left front side airbag also deployed as a result of a secondary ("side slap") collision with V2. This investigation also focused on the injury mechanisms of a 22-year-old male belted rear right passenger in the 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer compact utility vehicle (V2). This case vehicle (V2) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions (non-deployed). V2 sustained severe right side damage as a result of an oblique-angled collision with the 2001 Ford Expedition large utility vehicle (V1). V1 was westbound on a level two-lane rural asphalt road and proceeding straight on approach to a left curve. V2 was eastbound, on the same road, negotiating a right curve on a downhill slope. It was dark and not lighted with no adverse weather conditions and the road was dry. V2 exited the curve into the straight-away; it partially departed the right (south) pavement edge onto the grass shoulder. The driver of V2 steered left in an attempt to reenter the road. This maneuver initiated a counterclockwise rotation as V2 subsequently traversed the travel lanes across the path of the westbound V1. As V2 crossed the westbound lane, the right front area was impacted by the frontal area of V1 (Event 1). This impact resulted in moderate damage to V1 and severe damage to V2. V1 rotated counterclockwise and began its post-impact trajectory towards the northwest. The initial event compounded V2's counterclockwise rotation further as the right rear area struck (i.e. "side slapped") the left rear area of V1 (Event 2). This secondary impact resulted in moderate damage to each vehicle. V1 departed the north pavement edge and came to rest straddling the road edge line facing southwest. V2 departed the south pavement edge and penetrated a wooded area where it came to rest facing south. The 37-year-old female belted driver of the 2001 Ford Expedition was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat track approximated to be at a mid-to-rear position. Seat belt use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the available driver three-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At Event 1, the driver moved in a forward and slightly lateral left trajectory in response to the 11 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual seat belt, knee bolster, and deployed frontal airbag. Indentations and scuff marks were identified on the left knee bolster, with deformation noted on the aft reinforcement frame. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal airbag was evidenced by the scuff marks documented across the face of the membrane. Although no steering wheel rim deformation was found, full compression of the column shear capsules was identified. At Event 2, the driver kinematic was redirected to the left in response to the 9 o'clock impact force. Pronounced indentations were documented from the rear upper to the forward lower quadrants on the left front door panel. This contact pattern was attributed to the driver's left pelvic and lower extremity regions. Interaction with the deployed left front side airbag was evidenced by the scuff marks identified across the lower half of the membrane's inboard surface. Outboard of this contact point, a localized crack was noted on the B-pillar cover panel. The 43-year-old male belted front right passenger of the 2001 Ford Expedition (V1) was presumed to be seated in an upright posture, with the seat track approximated to be at a mid-to-rear position. Seat belt use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the available front right three-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At Event 1, the front right passenger moved in a forward and slightly lateral trajectory in response to the 11 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual seat belt, glove compartment door, and deployed frontal airbag. Scuff marks were identified on the glove compartment door, which was found out of place. Interaction with the deployed front right passenger airbag was evidenced by the fabric transfers and scuff marks documented across the face of the membrane. At Event 2, the passenger kinematic was redirected to the left in response to the 9 o'clock impact force. No contact evidence identified for this passenger was attributed to the second event. The 11-year-old female belted rear left passenger of the 2001 Ford Expedition (V1) was presumed to be seated in an upright posture and facing forward. Seat belt use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the available rear left three-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At Event 1, the rear left passenger moved in a forward and slightly lateral left trajectory in response to the 11 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual seat belt and rear aspect of the driver seat back. A pronounced indentation was identified along the midsection of the driver seat back, and possibly attributed to the passenger's feet or knees. At Event 2, the passenger kinematic was redirected to the left in response to the 9 o'clock impact force. No contact evidence identified for this passenger was attributed to the second event. The 8-year-old male belted rear right passenger of the 2001 Ford Expedition (V1) was presumed to be seated in an upright posture and facing forward. Seat belt use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the available rear right three-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At Event 1, the rear right passenger moved in a forward and slightly lateral left trajectory in response to the 11 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual seat belt and rear aspect of the front right seat back. A pronounced indentation was identified along the midsection of the front right seat back, which possibly was attributed to the passenger's feet. At Event 2, the passenger kinematic was redirected to the left in response to the 9 o'clock impact force. No contact evidence identified for this passenger was attributed to the second event. The 37-year-old female belted driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital then subsequently transferred to a nearby trauma center by ground emergency services. The 11-year-old female belted rear left passenger and 8-year-old male belted rear right passenger of V1 were transported directly from the crash site by ground EMS to a local hospital and then transferred via air to the trauma center. The 43-year-old male belted front right passenger was transported by ground to landing zone for air EMS to transport to the trauma center. The front right passenger was admitted for the treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision; the other three occupants of V1 were admitted for treatment of moderate injuries. The 22-year-old male belted rear right passenger of the 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer (V2) was presumed to be seated in an upright posture and facing forward. Seat belt use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the available rear right three-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At Event 1, the rear right passenger of V2 moved in a lateral right and forward trajectory in response to the 2 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual seat belt and right side interior surface. A pronounced indentation was identified on the armrest of the rear right door, which was attributed to the passenger's pelvic region. The headliner over the roof side rail area was found abraded and scuffed, with (possible) small (scalp) hairs embedded into the fabric. A distinct fabric transfer was documented on the (mid) right B-pillar, along with deep scratches into the contact site. Extensive intrusion of right sided components into the front right passenger space displaced the front seat back into the rear right passenger space. The resulting reduction of the rear right passenger space suggested additional interaction with this component during the occupant kinematic response. Rearward displacement across the second row seat back also suggested a rebound by the rear passengers; however, post-impact contamination by on-site cleanup efforts could not be ruled out as a source of this deformation (crash debris was placed into vehicle interior compartment). At Event 2, the passenger kinematic was compounded into right sided components in response to the 3 o'clock impact force. The 22-year-old male belted rear right passenger of V2 was transported by ground to a local trauma center and subsequently admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. The 19-year-old male belted driver of V2 was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a nearby trauma center (treatment status unknown). The 19-year-old male belted front right passenger of V2 was pronounced dead at the scene. The 19-year-old male belted rear left passenger of V2 was transported directly from the crash site to a nearby trauma center (treatment status unknown). Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
