Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Daewoo Leganza, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a 90-dgree left curve. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the dirt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 failed to negotiate the curve, ran off the right side of the road and struck a small tree with the front of V1. V1 rotated counter-clockwise approximately 30 degrees and struck another small tree with the right quarter panel. V1 came to rest against off the road facing south. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 19-year-old male driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a regional level-one trauma center where he was treated for a closed head injury, facial abrasions, and a scalp avulsion (MAIS-2, ISS-5). The 18-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was also not using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported to a regional level-one trauma center and admitted for treatment.
