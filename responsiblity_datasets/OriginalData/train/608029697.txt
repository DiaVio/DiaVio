The case vehicle, a four-door 2002 Pontiac Grand Am, was northbound on a level, dry, two-lane asphalt roadway approaching a sharp left curve. It was dark and there was no adverse weather. The driver drifted off the edge of the road and the driver overcorrected in an attempt to return to the roadway. The driver lost control of the vehicle and it entered a counterclockwise yaw, encountered a shallow drainage ditch and rolled right side leading six-quarter turns before it came to rest on its top facing south. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. The 26-year-old male driver was not restrained by a belt, but his steering-wheel air bag deployed. The 32-year-old female right-front passenger was not restrained by a belt but top instrument panel air bag deployed. Both occupants of the case vehicle were transported to a local hospital. The driver sustained police reported 'A' injuries. The right-front passenger was transported to a level-one trauma center with severe injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
