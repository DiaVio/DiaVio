Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2010 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the asphalt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and V1 crossed the centerline, the westbound lane and departed the left side of the road. The left side of V1 sideswiped a tree just off the edge of the road and V1 continued in an east-northeast direction. V1 traveled along the roadside for approximately 30 more meters and the front of V1 struck a large tree at the figh-front corner. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 100 degrees around the tree and came to rest in a residential lawn facing south-southwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 53-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel, seat-mounted, and left roof siderail air bags all deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
