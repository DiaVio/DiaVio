This case occupant is a 56 year old female driver who was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. This driver was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with frontal and knee air bag deployments and she sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a state highway during daylight hours, under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. The roadway is comprised of one east and one westbound travel lane, with a paved shoulder on the north side of the street. The travel lanes are comprised of asphalt and are level in both directions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2013 Subaru Impreza four door hatchback, was traveling west in the westbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Plymouth Voyager minivan, was traveling east in the eastbound lane. The driver of V2 suffered a seizure and V2 departed its lane to the left. V2 returned to the eastbound lane momentarily, then traveled back across the westbound lane, departed the roadway and traveled onto the north shoulder. V2 then began to travel back towards the westbound lane. The driver of V1 braked and steered right but could not avoid the collision. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's front row seat belt retractor pretensioners and the deployment of V1's driver frontal and knee air bags. V2 overpowered V1, forcing V1 backwards and off the roadway, where it came to final rest facing southwest. V2 rotated clockwise, traveled off the roadway and also came to final rest facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 56 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted and lower left instrument panel mounted knee air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in V1.
