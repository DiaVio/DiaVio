The driver fled the scene on foot. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.

V1, the Isuzu Rodeo, was driven by a 21-year old male who was not injured. The driver stated that when his parents left for church, he decided to get into their vehicle to listen to music. He advised that he turned the vehicle on to listen to music, and somehow the vehicle slipped into gear. His foot was on the accelerator when this happened, and the vehicle lunged backward. He said that he did not know what to do, because he does not know how to drive.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling end departure. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a performance error, poor directional control (failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected). Associated factors were all experience related. This was the driver's first time on the roadway and the first time driving any type of vehicle. The driver does not have a driver's license, and has never taken any form of driver education. He was very uncomfortable with the vehicle.
