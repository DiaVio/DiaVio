This case involves a left, small-overlap frontal-impact between the front of a passenger car and a utility pole. The case vehicle, a 2012 Hyundai Elantra station wagon, was westbound on a dry, level, two-lane, asphalt road approaching a ‘T’ intersection. It was dusk and clear. The driver reportedly was blinded by the sun. The case vehicle traversed the intersection, departed the west edge of the intersection road and swiped a wooden sign post. The post broke and as the sign fell it struck the right side of the windshield header. The vehicle struck a 26-cm diameter utility pole with its left-front bumper corner. The case vehicle was occupied by the restrained 76-year-old male driver and the unrestrained 68-year-old female right-front passenger. None of the available frontal or side impact air bags deployed. The driver sustained a multiple moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
