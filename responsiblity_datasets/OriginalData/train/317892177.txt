This case focuses on a restrained 50 year old male driver in a 2010 Chevrolet HHR (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags and dual side curtains. The driver's frontal steering wheel mounted airbag and the left side curtain were the only airbags to deploy during the collision. V2, a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours during a rain shower. The trafficway was composed of two westbound lanes (one straight and one right turn), two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. The north and south lanes were divided by a grass median and crossover area for vehicles traveling west attempting to turn south. All lanes were asphalt and wet. The posted speed limit for the west lane was 72 kph (45 mph). The posted speed limit for the north and south lanes was 105 mph (65 mph). The westbound lane was controlled by a stop sign. The northbound lanes curved slightly to the left. V1 was heading west while stopped in the one-way lane at the intersection. V2 was traveling northbound while negotiating a left curve and in the left lane approaching the intersection. As both vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise after impact and went into the north median. While in the median the left rear bumper corner of V1 contacted a sign. V1 came to rest in the median, facing north. V2 rotated counterclockwise after impact and came to rest in its initial travel lane, facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver in V1 was transported to a level one trauma center where he received treatment for moderate injuries that he sustained in the crash.
