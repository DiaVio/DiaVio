This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 63-year-old female belted driver with curtain and outboard seatback airbag protection. She was driving a compact crossover utility vehicle when it was involved in a near-side impact to an overhanging tree branch, sustaining minor damage. She sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred during early afternoon hours on a dry road under clear skies. A 2015 Kia Sportage compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was traveling northeast negotiating a right curve on a two-lane rural road. The bituminous road was on a 3% uphill grade with 2% superelevation in the curve. V1 was initially traveling in the right lane when the driver reportedly fell asleep. V1 crossed the centerline and departed the left side of the road. V1 struck an overhanging tree branch with its left plane at the junction of the left A-pillar and left front fender (Event 1). This impact deployed both curtain and seatback airbags. V1 then continued through a residential yard before coming to rest against two small ornamental yard statues, impacting them with the front left corner (Event 2). V1 was towed due to damage. The 63-year-old female driver was belted at the time of the crash as evidenced by the actuated retractor pretensioner, leaving the belt in the payed out position. The anchor pretensioner was not actuated and there was no buckle pretensioner installed. Both curtain airbags and both outboard seatback airbags deployed. The available steering wheel hub and right instrument panel airbags did not deploy. No other airbags were installed. This occupant was transported to a hospital and released. Ten days after the crash she returned to the hospital and was transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
