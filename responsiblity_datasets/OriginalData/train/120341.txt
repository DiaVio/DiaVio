Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Dodge Intrepid, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way, rural roadway. It was daylight, snowing, and the bituminous road surface was icy. The road curved slightly to the left and V1 was traversing a negative grade slope when the driver lost control on the icy surface. V1 began to rotate in a clockwise manner and departed the right side of the road. The left side of V1 struck a large tree and came to rest. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 24 year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
