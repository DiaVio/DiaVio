This case involved the 59 year old restrained male driver and the 55 year old restrained female front right passenger of a 2008 Nissan Altima two door coupe (V1). V1 was involved in a head on collision with a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck (V2). The driver and passenger of V1 were restrained by the manual lap and shoulder belts and had deployed frontal airbags. The left side seat mounted side impact bag and the left head curtain airbag also deployed. The crash occurred during daylight hours at the hilltop of a four lane trafficway. The two northbound and two southbound lanes were divided by a narrow grass median. It was raining at the time of the crash and the straight asphalt roadway was wet. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V2 was going south and as it approached the hilltop, it struck a pool of water in the roadway and lost traction. V2 traveled off the left side of the roadway and across the center median into the inside northbound lane. V1 was traveling north in the left lane when V2 came into its travel lane. The two vehicles collided in an offset frontal configuration with the front left of V1 striking the front left of V2. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the right northbound lane. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest still partially in the median. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was fatally injuried and transported directly to the county coronor's office. The front right passenger of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized.
