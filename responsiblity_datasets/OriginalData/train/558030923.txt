The case vehicle, a 4-door 2006 Ford Escape SUV was in the outside westbound lane of a four-lane divided highway. It was daylight and raining. The roadway was wet and had a downgrade. The case vehicle had drifted to the left and the driver corrected by steering right. The vehicle started to fishtail to the left. The driver corrected by steering left and lost control of the vehicle as it entered a counterclockwise rotation and entered the downward sloping grass median. The case vehicle, still in a yaw and on a down slope rolled right-side leading four-quarter turns. The case vehicle came to rest on its wheels facing east-southeast. The 18-year-old male driver was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. The case occupant, the 72-year-old male right-front passenger was restrained and the mid-mounted instrument panel air bag did not deploy. The driver sustained police reported 'B' injuries. The male right-front passenger sustained critical injuries and both case vehicle occupants were transported to an outside hospital. The male right-front passenger was later transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
