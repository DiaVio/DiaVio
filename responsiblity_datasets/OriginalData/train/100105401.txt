This case involved a belted driver responding to a head-on, left off-set frontal impact with another passenger vehicle and frontal impact air bag deployment. This crash occurred on a two-lane, east/west trafficway traveling through a rural, mountainous area. The roadway had a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. There was a left curve for eastbound traffic just prior to the crash site while the westbound approach was straight. The roadway was level at the site of the crash. The weather was cloudy but the bituminous roadway dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4-door SUV, was traveling eastbound, negotiating the left curve. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The 66-year-old, male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as evidenced by physical evidence. The opposing vehicle, vehicle 2 (V2), a 2006 Saturn Vue 4-door SUV, was traveling westbound along the straight stretch of road. As V1 completed the left curve the driver, apparently, did not straighten the steering out and traveled into the westbound lane and into the path of V2. The front left of V1 struck the front left of V2. V1's frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, pivoting on its front right wheel, and overturn onto its right side where it came to rest across the eastbound lane facing north. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 90-degrees and came to rest straddling the north lane line facing south. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to "A" injuries as rated by police.
