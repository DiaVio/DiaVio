This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 31-year-old male belted driver of a 2007 Honda Accord LX intermediate size coupe. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions, which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1996 Dodge Ram 2500 large pickup truck (Vehicle 2). V1 was northbound on a two-lane state highway, proceeding straight. It was dark with no adverse weather conditions. The road was dry with a downhill grade. V2 was southbound, also proceeding straight. V1 crossed the centerline into the path of the southbound V2. The driver of V2 reportedly braked and steered right in avoidance of the impending harmful event. As V1 entered the southbound travel lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of V2 (Event 1). Impact resulted in severe damage to V1. Both vehicles came to rest on the west shoulder of the road; V1 came to rest facing northeast as V2 came to rest facing southwest. The 31-year-old male belted driver (and sole occupant) of V1 was transported to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
