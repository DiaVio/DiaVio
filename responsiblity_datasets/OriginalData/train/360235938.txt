The case occupant is a 44 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, involved in a head-on frontal collision with a frontal impact air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during early evening hours with snow and icy conditions on a two lane, two way roadway. In the area where the crash occurred, the eastbound travel lane curves to the right with a downhill grade, and the westbound lane curves to the left with an uphill grade. There are narrow shoulders present on both sides of the roadway, but at the time of the crash they were covered with high snow banks. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Chevrolet Silverado four door crew cab pickup, was traveling east in the eastbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), an unknown year/make/model medium/heavy truck pulling two trailers, was traveling west in the westbound lane. As both vehicles were negotiating the curved section of roadway, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and crossed over into V2's lane of travel. The front of V1 struck V2 head-on, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of its driver side frontal air bag. V1 was overpowered by V2 and began to rotate counterclockwise as it moved west. Then V1's right rear impacted the left side of V2, resulting in moderate damage. Both vehicles came to final rest in the westbound lane, facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 44 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a steering column mounted frontal air bag deployment. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
