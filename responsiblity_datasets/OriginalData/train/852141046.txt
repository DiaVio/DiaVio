This case occupant is a 20 year old female driver who was lap/shoulder belted and involved in a moderate severity near-side impact with a medium/heavy truck. This crash occurred at a T intersection during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions that has a stop sign for only westbound traffic. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser 4 door hatchback, was westbound in the left turn lane of three lane, two way street. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 International medium/heavy dump truck, was northbound in lane two of three lanes and traveling straight through the intersection with no traffic controls for north and south directions. V1 began to make a left turn and V2 began braking with lockup skid marks prior to the intersection before the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 was rotated counterclockwise about 90 degrees post impact and then roll backwards to the northwest. V1 then departed the roadway off the west road edge where the back and sides of V1 impacted through a plastic fence. V1 then came to final rest in the field facing southeast just beyond the fence. V2 stopped northbound in the middle of the intersection and mainly in the same travel lane. V1 had to be tow due to damage. V2 was driven away. The driver is the case occupant and the only person in V1. This case occupant was 20 year old female who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and no air bags deployed.
