This frontal crash case involves a 67 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with frontal and right side curtain air bag deployments. She sustained serious injuries in the crash. This single vehicle crash occurred during evening hours, in darkness, under clear weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2012 Honda Civic four door sedan, was northbound in lane one of a two lane, two way asphalt state highway. In V1's precrash area the northbound lane curves to the right and has a downhill grade. There are numerous plants and large trees lining both sides of the travel lanes. V1 was negotiating the curve when the driver fell asleep and departed the west side of the roadway. V1's front impacted a large tree stump, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the driver's frontal and right curtain air bags. Then V1's right A pillar and windshield impacted an overhanging tree branch, resulting in minor damage. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest facing northwest near the tree trunk. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 67 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag and right roof side rail mounted curtain deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital. She was transferred to the trauma center on the following day. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
