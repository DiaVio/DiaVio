He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle a 2004, four-door Mazda 6 was eastbound on a snowy/slushy two-lane, asphalt road with an 8% up-grade. It was dark and snowing. The case vehicle drifted right, departed the road and sideswiped a w-beam guard rail. The impact deflected the case vehicle back onto the road and it entered a counterclockwise yaw. It departed the roadway off the left side, went through a snow drift and struck the ground as it went up the grade of a hill. It came to rest facing southwest. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. The unrestrained 18-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to an outside hospital before being transferred to a level-one trauma center, where he enrolled as a case occupant. He was not found until seven hours after the crash.
