This case involves a restrained 29 year old female driver in a 2015 Nissan Versa (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side airbags, and dual side curtains. The steering wheel mounted airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. V2, a 2001 Ford F-150 pickup was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry, asphalt, two-lane, two-lane roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions and the road was dry. The posted speed limit was 64 kph (40 mph). The southbound lane had a downhill slope and the northbound lane had an uphill slope. V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane while its driver negotiated a right hand curve. V2 was traveling north in the northbound lane while its driver negotiated a left hand curve. V1 drifted over the left lane line and the driver lightly applied her brakes. After completely entering the opposing lane, the driver of V1 applied the brakes harder and steered right in an attempt to avoid the impending collision with V2. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2. The impact caused V1 to be pushed rearward while rotating clockwise. V1 came to rest partially off the west side of the road while still in the opposing lane, facing northwest. V2 continued a short distance while rotating counterclockwise and came to rest partially in its original travel lane and partially off the east side of the road, facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center where she received treatment for serious injuries she sustained in the crash.
