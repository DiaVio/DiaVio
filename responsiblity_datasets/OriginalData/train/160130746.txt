Vehicle One (V1), a 2004 Ford Taurus sedan, was traveling north in lane two of a four lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2004 Toyota Camry sedan, was traveling south in lane two of the same roadway, approaching the same intersection. V2 attempted to turn left at the intersection and the right side of V2 contacted the front of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest in the northeastern part of the intersection facing approximately northeast and both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and case study occupant was a 33-year-old female. She was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt, and her frontal airbag and stalk-mounted pretensioner both deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
