A two vehicle daytime collision occurred during morning hours. The collision occurred at the intersection of an east-west arterial road and a north-south side avenue. The pre-crash roadway for the side road is two-way travel without lane markings paved with asphalt, controlled by stop signs. The pre-crash roadway for the main road is a +9% grade approaching the intersection is paved with asphalt, with no traffic controls. The main roadway has a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph), and the side street has a speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Saturn LW2 wagon driven by a 39 year-old female with one passenger, was stopped at a stop sign, facing south and preparing to cross the main roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Buick Roadmaster sedan driven by a 26 year-old female with one passenger, was traveling east on the main roadway. V1 entered into the intersection as V2 was crossing over, and the front corner of V1 impacted the left corner of V2. The two vehicles deflected, and side slapped with the rear bumper of V2 impacting the right rear of V1. V2 came to rest on the sidewalk at the southeast corner of the intersection. V1 came to rest slightly behind V2 and to the left. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene, but emitted horrendous sounds as it was driven away. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection.
