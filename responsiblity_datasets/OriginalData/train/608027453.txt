The case vehicle, a four-door 2005 Chevrolet Colorado pickup was eastbound on a snow covered two-lane roadway approaching a slower-moving eastbound non-contact vehicle. It was dark and there was no adverse weather, but the road was snowy. The driver of the case vehicle passed the non-contact vehicle on the right and lost control of the case vehicle on the shoulder. The case vehicle entered a clockwise rotation and went into a ditch, sideswiped a sloped concrete sewer access with its right side and struck the stone culvert of a private drive with its undercarriage. It continued to rotate clockwise before it came to rest in the driveway facing west. The 24-year-old female driver was not wearing a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case occupant, the 37-year-old male right-front passenger was not wearing the three-point belt and the mid-mounted instrument panel air bag deployed. The driver sustained police reported 'B' injuries. The case occupant sustained severe injuries and both case vehicle occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center.
