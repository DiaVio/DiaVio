Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Chevrolet HHR, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-way, two-lane dirt road and was approaching a three-leg intersection with a three-lane paved road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Hummer H2, 4-door wagon was traveling north in the left northbound lane of the intersecting three-lane, two-way road. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the bituminous and dirt road surfaces were dry. The driver of V1 intended on turning left and both V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to be redirected to the north-west, trip over its right side wheels and roll 5-quarter turns coming to rest on its right side in a deep ditch off the west side of the road. V2 came to a controlled stop downstream from the impact. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage while V2 was driven away. The 18-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
