This case involves a belted front right seat passenger of an SUV responding to a left side leading rollover crash. This single vehicle crash occurred on the southbound side of a multi-lane interstate. There were four lanes for southbound travel and an exit ramp lane, departing to the right (west), divided from the northbound lanes by a concrete divider. The left roadside (east/median) consisted of a relatively narrow paved shoulder and the tall concrete barrier. The right roadside (west) consisted of a paved shoulder followed by an area of natural terrain filled with wood chips between the interstate and the east edge of the exit ramp. The southbound lanes were relatively level and had a gradual left curve. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the mid-day, weekday crash. The case vehicle, a 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4-door SUV, was traveling southbound in the number-four (left) lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and front row driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. There were two occupants of the vehicle. Both the 46-year-old male driver and the 46-year-old female front right seat passenger, the case subject, were using the belt restraints. The driver of the vehicle was negotiating the left curve, and had already passed the exit ramp departure point when he steered the vehicle hard to the right, for an unknown reason. Eyewitness accounts relate no other vehicle actions or outside stimuli prompted the maneuver. The vehicle began an ever-increasing clockwise yaw as it traveled across the southbound lanes, into the natural terrain and tripped to the left an estimated eleven quarter-turns, before coming to rest on its right side on the exit ramp. It was thought that the vehicle first landed on its right roof rail, A-pillar & B-pillar area, directly over the subject's seating position. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. Both occupants were transported to a trauma facility due to varying degrees of injury.
