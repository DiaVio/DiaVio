The crash occurred off the left side of an east/west two-lane undivided roadway. The road was dry, level and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). It was during the week at night, the road was dark, and traffic was very light.

V1, a 2006 Dodge Charger 4-door sedan with one occupant, was traveling east when the driver lost consciousness, causing V1 to drift across the centerline, depart the roadway to the left, and strike a telephone pole. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, driven by a 58-year-old female who reported complaints of pain and was transported, stated that she was on her way to her sister's house when she blacked out. The next thing she remembers is being helped out of the car. The driver stated that she was tired from a long day, but does not think she fell asleep. It is the belief of the driver and her physician that she blacked out for some unknown reason and is currently undergoing testing to determine the cause. No avoidance maneuver was attempted.
