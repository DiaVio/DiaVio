This case involves a belted driver of an sport utility vehicle (SUV) responding to a narrow, frontal center collision with a large tree and frontal impact air bag deployment. This single vehicle crash occurred on a north/south street traveling through a residential area. The roadway had a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. The roadway had an uphill grade from south to north and began straight but at the top of the hill curved left. An adjacent street adjoins just prior to the crash site but did not play a role. The weather was rainy and the bituminous roadway wet during the late morning, weekday crash. The case vehicle (2001 Lexus RX300, 4-door SUV) was traveling northbound up the hill. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, first row frontal impact air bags and first row seat back mounted side impact air bags. The 79-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. As the vehicle reached the top of the hill the roadway curved left but the subject did not negotiate the curve and the vehicle drove off of the right roadside, across the curb and into a landscaped corner plot. The front of the vehicle struck a 40cm diameter tree. The vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. The tree fractured and allowed the vehicle to continue forward where the left side mirror struck an adjacent tree. The vehicle came to rest in the landscaped plot, facing northwest. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury(s).
