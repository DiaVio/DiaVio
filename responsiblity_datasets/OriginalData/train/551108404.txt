This crash occurred late at night with no street lights in the area. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Toyota Corolla was southbound on a two lane, two way roadway that eventually curved to the left where the speed limit is reduced to 35 mph/56 kmph. V1 was passing another vehicle prior to the curve and returned to the lane of travel as the curve left in the roadway started. V1 then began to depart the roadway to the right and started to rotate counterclockwise on the roadway shoulder. V1 continued off road, crossed an intersecting road before entering a gravel dirt area. The right side impacted a sign post as the vehicle slid laterally into a group of trees. The right side back struck the first tree and this rotated V1 clockwise into a second tree that impacted directly into the front right passenger compartment. V1 continued to rotate clockwise and the right front fender impacted a third tree as V1 came to rest on against a tree stump that impacted the lower left side driver door. A pond was located near the group of trees and the front left portion of the vehicle was partially in the water and mud. V1 had four occupants seated in the front left and right seats and the back outboards seats. None of the occupants were wearing seatbelts. The frontal airbags did deployed as well as the front seat belt pretensioners. Three of the occupants are case subjects: the driver, a 27 year old male, the back left occupant, a 34 year old male, and the back right occupant, a 23 year old male. All were airlifted to the trauma center. The front right passenger was fatally injured. The vehicle was disabled and towed.
