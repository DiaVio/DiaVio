While airborne, V1 impacted the top hood into a tree branch and then the top and right passenger side compartment impacted the ground where a large tree stump and limb were located. V1 continued to rollover onto it tires, then the roof again and as the right side was on the ground the undercarriage and left side sill at the driver's door impacted a large tree. V1 then rebounded off this tree and back on to its roof top where it came to final rest. V1 was disabled and towed. The driver and front right passenger were the only occupants in V1.
