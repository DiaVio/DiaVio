This near-side impact crash involved a 25 year-old male driver who was restrained and sustained severe injuries. This intersection crash occurred during the early morning hours when it was dark and no street lights were present. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Dodge Charger four door sedan, was traveling eastbound on a two way, two lane roadway, and stopped for a stop sign at an intersection, intending to continue straight ahead. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Dodge Durango, was southbound on a two lane, two way roadway with a highway speed limit bordered by paved shoulders and gravel shoulders. V2 was proceeding straight through the intersection with no traffic controls for the southbound and northbound traffic. V1 then entered the intersection. V2, prior to the intersection, recognized V1 and began to brake leaving skid marks before the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. The impact of V2 forced V1 laterally with some slight rotation counterclockwise, and the front of V2 then also contacted the left side quarter panel of V2. Both vehicles continued to the southeast corner of the intersection and V1 came to final rest on the gravel shoulder facing northeast. V2 came to final rest facing southeast on the paved shoulder. Both vehicles were towed and disabled. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and no other passengers were in V1. He was a 25 year-old male who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. He sustained severe injuries. He was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center.
