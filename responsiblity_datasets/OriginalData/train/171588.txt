Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Jeep Wrangler, 2-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same road. V1 was traveling uphill and going along a straight section of road, while V2 was negotiating a right curve and trraveling downhill. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the asphalt road surface was dry. As V1 approach the top of the hill, the driver of V2 failed to keep his vehicle in his lane and V2 crossed the centerline. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a narrow, offset-frontal configuration. The impact caused V1 to veer off the road to the right, enter into a clockwise yaw and trip over its left side wheels rolling 4-quarter turns. V1 came to rest off the right side of the road, on its wheels, facing north-northeast. After impact, V2 continued down the road in the westbound lane several meters, coming to rest on the north shoulder, facing east-northeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 38-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via air ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
