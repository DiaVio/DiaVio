Case Focus: The case occupant is a 66-year-old, restrained male driver of a Toyota Solara involved in a right sided impact followed by a frontal with other vehicles. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Toyota Solara coupe, was facing north and stopped at a stop sign waiting to make a left turn onto a three lane, two way roadway out of a parking lot under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2007 Lexus ES350 sedan, was traveling west in lane one of the three lane, two way roadway. V1 attempted to make a left turn and the right side of V1 contacted the front of V2. This impact caused the right side of V1 to side slap the left side of V2. V2 came to final rest in the roadway. The side slap impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and it departed the roadway to the south, re-entering the parking lot where the front of V1 struck the front of a parked 1990 Geo Prism sedan. V1 came to final rest after this impact. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 66-year-old male and case study occupant was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. No air bags deployed in the crash. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment and was eventually transferred to a level-one trauma center.
