This single vehicle night time crash occurred a few hours before mid-night during dark hours on a southbound three-lane expressway with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). Each side of the expressway, at different locations, has either concrete jersey barriers or guard-rails and no shoulders. On the other side of the barrier to the left, there are a like number of northbound lanes; those lanes were not a factor in this crash. The roadway is straight, level, bituminous, and was illuminated by street-lights. At the time of the crash construction work was ongoing, the weather was clear, the roads were dry and there were no road defects or sight restrictions.

Vehicle one (V 1), a 2006 Chrysler Sebring 4-door with two occupants, was southbound in an unknown lane when, for unknown reasons, V 1 departed the road to the left, struck the jersey barrier, then, over a distance of more than 4 kilometers, had 3 more impacts: with the concrete barrier off the right side of the expressway, with the concrete barrier off the left side of the expressway, and finally with a guard rail off the right side. V 1 then came to final rest in the number one lane facing generally southeast. V 1 was towed due to damage. The V 1 driver, a 52 year old male and passenger were transported to a local medical facility. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-Event movement for V 1 was coded as unknown, category This Vehicle Traveling - Off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related error: Unknown critical non-performance error.

The Police Report lists both coded and narrative references to an unknown illness and the crash sequence is consistent with an illness so depending upon the illness, it was probably either an associative factor or the Critical Reason. Also, the construction zone may have been an associative factor.
