This single vehicle rollover collision involved a 67 year old male driver, who was restrained by the lap/shoulder belt, with curtain air bag deployments. He sustained moderate severity injuries. This single vehicle rollover crash occurred during daylight hours under dry conditions and overcast skies. Vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Ford F350 Super Duty four door truck, was westbound in lane one of the three one-way lanes of a divided freeway with paved shoulders. V1 drifted to the right over the shoulder and then departed the roadway into a shallow ditch. V1 continued straight for some distance in the ditch and then the front bumper and below impacted a slight embankment of a drainage ditch with boulders. This impact lifted V1 upward and it began to roll to the left into an open grassy area. The front left tire dug into the ground as the left side contacted the ground. V1 continued to rollover a total of five quarter turns and came to final rest on its left side facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 67 year old male, is the case occupant. He was the only vehicle occupant. He was restrained by the manual lap/shoulder belt and both side curtains deployed during the rollover event. He sustained moderate severity injuries, was taken to a local hospital, and later was transferred to a trauma center.
