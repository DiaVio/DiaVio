This case involved a 31 year old restrained female driver of a 2013 Chrysler 300 four door sedan (V1). A 2003 Nissan Maxima four door was also involved in the collision. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, driver's knee bolster, dual side seatback mounted airbags, and dual first and second row side curtains. All frontal airbags, driver's side curtain, and driver's side airbag deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway. The roadway was flat, dry, and straight. The weather was clear. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was traveling east. V2 was traveling west. V2 crossed the center lane line. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and locking V1's brakes. The front of V2 contacted the front of V1. Both vehicles came to rest in the eastbound travel lane. V1 faced east at final rest. V2 faced west-northwest at final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was later transferred to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to the serious nature of her injuries.
