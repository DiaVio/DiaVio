This frontal crash case involves a 22 year old restrained male seated in the front left seating position (Driver) with deployed air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during daylight hours (early evening) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a level, curved two-lane bituminous roadway with no traffic control device involvement. The westbound travel lane is curved (to the right) and both travel lanes are separated by a double yellow line. The case vehicle (V1) a 2010 four-door Mazda 3 was being driven westbound and vehicle two (V2) a 2002 Ford F150 Super Cab was being driven eastbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, crossed over the double yellow line into the path of V2 resulting in a full frontal crash configuration for both vehicles. After initial impact V1 and V2 rotated slightly counter clockwise to their final resting positions in the eastbound lane of travel. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 22 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (retractor type pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The available side seat back mounted air bag and the roof side rail mounted curtain air bag did not deploy. This case occupant's seat was positioned between middle and rear most and the seat back was in the upright position before the crash and moved slightly forward after impact. The driver's left and right (rear) seat track were both deformed laterally to the left due to the crash. The floor pan in this area was deformed slightly down due to the energy in the crash. The seat cushion for this seating position does not seem to be affected by the seat track deformation. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by helicopter for treatment of his injuries.
