This crash occurred in the westbound lane of a two-lane roadway. There was one westbound lane and one eastbound lane. The roadway curved slightly to the left, was level, bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). It was early morning on a weekday and the roadway was covered with black ice.

V1 was a 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix, driven by a 40 year-old female who reported minor injuries. V1 was traveling westbound beginning to negotiate a left curve, when it lost traction on black ice. The vehicle went off of the roadway to the right and struck a utility pole where it came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was "environment related factor, slick roads." The driver of this vehicle travels this road everyday, so he is very familiar with it. When this researcher arrived on scene the roadway was still icy and gave the illusion of only being wet. According to the EDR the vehicle was traveling at 48 mph, which is over the speed limit, however I cannot account for its accuracy due to the traction loss. Given normal conditions the vehicle would have been able to negotiate the curve. The driver also stated that previous to the crash scene, the same roadway was not icy.
