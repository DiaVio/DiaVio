This near-side impact crash case involves a 68 year old restrained female with a deployed frontal air bag and actuated seat belt retractor pretensioner who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during evening hours at a Y-configured intersection with clear, dry conditions. There are no street lights and it was dark with overcast weather conditions. The case vehicle one (V1), a two door coupe 2005 Ford Mustang, was traveling south on a two lane, two way street that angled and intersected with a crossing street that is controlled with a stop sign for this direction. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2003 Kia Sedona minivan, was traveling north on this two lane, two way crossing street and had no control for this intersection. V1 started from a stop to make a left turn when the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and departed the west side of the roadway into the ditch and came to final rest facing northeast. V2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest still on the roadway facing southwest partially in the southbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 68 year old female driver of V1 who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. Other non-case occupants in V1, included a 17 year old front right female passenger who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt and the instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed and seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated at impact. She was not injured in the crash.
