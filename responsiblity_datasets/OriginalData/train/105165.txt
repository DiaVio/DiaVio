Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1996 Chevrolet Lumina, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. It was daylight, cloudy, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly experienced brake failure and in an effort to slow the vehicle, he drove off the right side of the road and entered a shallow ditch. V1 traveled a short distance and the front of V1 struck a large tree (28-cm diameter). V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 34-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 14-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to different local hospitals and the case occupant was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
