This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 17-year-old male belted driver with deployed airbags. He sustained serious injuries in a frontal collision with a medium diameter tree. The crash occurred midmorning on a dry road under clear skies. A 2007 Honda Civic intermediate size coupe (Vehicle 1) was traveling southwest negotiating a left curve. The bituminous two-way, two-lane road was in a rural area and had a 6% downhill grade. After V1 negotiated a left curve, the driver reported that he swerved to avoid a cat in the road. V1 crossed the center line and traveled off the road to the left. V1 began traversing across a downwards embankment when it struck a small tree (6 cm diameter) with its left plane in a non-horizontal impact (Event 1). V1 continued traversing to the bottom of the embankment where it impacted a medium size tree (37 cm diameter) head-on with its front left corner (Event 2). V1 came to final rest against the tree and was towed due to damage. The 17-year-old male driver was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The available buckle pretensioner was not actuated. The steering wheel hub and right front instrument panel airbags deployed. The available outboard seatback and curtain airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 15-year-old female right front belted occupant. Both her retractor and buckle pretensioners were actuated. The right front instrument panel airbag deployed while the available outboard seatback and curtain airbags did not deploy. She was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of minor injuries and released.
