This case focuses on a restrained 55 year old male driver in a 2005 Mercury Grand Marquis (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags of which the driver's steering mounted airbag deployed. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was traveling north in the northbound lane while negotiating a left hand curve. A non-contact vehicle was trailing V1. The driver of the non-contact vehicle moved into the left lane and attempted to overtake and pass V1. Before completely overtaking V1, the non-contact vehicle moved sharply right back into its original lane. The driver of V1 noticed the non-contact vehicle encroaching into his lane and steered right onto the roadside in an attempt to avoid contact. After completely departing the roadway, the driver of V1 steered left and braked in an attempt to maneuver V1 back onto the roadway. This maneuver sent V1 into a counterclockwise yaw. While on the roadside, V1 contacted a culvert with its front left tire. This impact caused even more counterclockwise rotation. V1 tripped on a dirt mound with its right side leading. V1 slid on its right side before contacting a barbed wire fence with its top rear. V1 continued to roll seven quarter turns before coming to rest in the grass on a residential property. V1 rolled a total of eight quarter turns before it came to rest on its wheels facing west. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground to a level one trauma center and treated for serious injuries that he sustained in the crash.
