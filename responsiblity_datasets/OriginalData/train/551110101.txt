This crash occurred at night with street lights where a three lane, two way street with a center left turn lane intersects with a three lane, two way highway also with a center left turn lane. Speed limit on the highway was posted at 40 mph/64 kpmh and the traffic signals were cycling properly at the intersection. The weather conditions were clear and dry. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Crown Victoria four door sedan, was westbound on the street and attempted a left turn southbound on the highway at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Kenworth tractor semi-truck that was double, fully loaded was northbound travelling through the intersection at the speed limit and attempted to swerve left to avoid V1. In the middle of the intersection the front of V1 impacted the right side front corner of the truck. This impact rotated V1 clockwise causing a second impact to the left side with the right side of V2 before a third side-slap impact occurred with the left back of V1 into the right side of V2. After the multiple impacts into the moving V2, V1 was re-directed northbound beyond the intersection in the southbound left turn lane. As V2 continued swerving left post impact on to the southbound shoulder and then returned to the roadway and came to rest north of V1 facing northeast across all lanes. V1 and V2 were damaged and both had to be towed from the scene. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 37 year old male, who was wearing his lap/shoulder belt with the frontal airbag deploying with no other passengers in V1. The case driver was transported to the trauma center.
