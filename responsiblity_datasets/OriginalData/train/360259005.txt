This severe frontal crash involved a 24 year old male driver who was restrained with a lap/shoulder belt with a frontal airbag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Nissan Altima four door sedan was eastbound in lane two of a five lane two way street with a center left turn lane. Vehicle one was traveling at a high rate of speed and approached an area congested with traffic stopped in both of the eastbound lanes. V1 swerved left into the opposite lanes and lost control. V1 then departed the roadway to the left and the front of V1 impacted a utility pole that sheared off its base. The pole then fell onto the front part of V1's top causing minor damage. V1 rotated clockwise slightly and came to final rest on the sidewalk facing east on the northwest corner of an intersection. V1 was severely damaged and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and was the only person in V1. He is a 24 year old male who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and his retractor pretensioner actuated during the first crash event. His front steering column mounted airbag also deployed. The right outboard seat back mounted side air bag and right roof side rail mounted curtain also deployed during the crash. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
