This single vehicle crash occurred on a weekday during morning daylight hours. The location was an entrance ramp to a straight four lane divided (with positive barrier) asphalt highway. The ramp is a single lane, asphalt construction, curves to the right with an up slope. It was raining and the roads were wet. The posted speed limit for the highway is 97 kmph (60 mph). The advisory speed limit for the ramp is 64 kmph (40 mph). The curvature and slope is unknown. There was road construction on the through traffic lanes at the time.

Vehicle one (V1,) a 1997 Ford Explorer with one occupant, was traveling on the entrance ramp to the westbound lanes of the highway. This entrance ramp was the connection between the southbound lanes and the westbound lanes of two major highways. After V1 had traveled about two thirds of the ramp, it started to rotate clockwise and travelled off of the left side of the ramp into the grass roadside. V1 rolled over to the left for three quarter turns. The vehicle came to final rest on its right side facing north on the paved shoulder of the westbound highway. The vehicle was towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

A 28-year old male was the driver of the vehicle. He told police he was traveling at 97 kmph (60 mph) prior to losing control of his vehicle. This driver refused to be interviewed.

The critical per-crash event was coded: this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for the conditions (e.g., wet roadway, curve, worn underinflated tires & excessive speed). The right rear tire of this vehicle was underinflated and showed a tread depth of only 1 mm. The wet road was an associative factor. Also, there was construction on the through traffic lanes.
