Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Mitsubishi Lancer, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of an eight-lane divided roadway (four lanes northbound, raised grassy median, four lanes southbound) and was approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Ford F250, king cab pickup truck was stopped in the right northbound lane ahead of V1 and was awaiting the change of the traffic signal. Vehicle three (V3), a 1998 Plymouth Voyager, minivan was stopped in the right northbound lane directly ahead of V2. It was daylight, the sky was cloudy, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 did not recognize that V2 was stopped and the front of V1 struck and underrode the rear of V2. V2 was subsequently pushed forward and struck the rear of V3. All three vehicles were reportedly towed due to vehicle damage. The 39-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 16-year-old female right-front passenger (non-case occupant) was using the available thre-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. The 3-year-old female right-rear passenger (case occupant) was seated in a high-back booster seat but the seat was not restrained to the vehicle via the three-point seat belt. All three occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and the two case occupants were later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
