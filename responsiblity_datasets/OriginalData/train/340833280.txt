This case involves a passenger car that departed the roadway and struck a 42-cm diameter tree in a left, off-set frontal mode. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2011 four-door Lexus GS 350, was southbound on a wet, level, two-lane asphalt road. The driver reportedly lost consciousness. Consequently, the case vehicle crossed the center-line, entered the northbound lane, departed the road off of the east edge and struck a 42-cm tree in a left, off-set frontal mode. It came to rest facing south-southeast. It was daylight and raining. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the restrained 83-year-old male driver. He had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact, and knee-bolster mounted air bags. The driver sustained multiple moderate injuries and was initially transported to an outside hospital, before he was transferred to level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
