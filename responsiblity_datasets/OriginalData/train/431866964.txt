This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 24-year-old male driver of a 2015 Mazda 3 (sport), 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags, (seat back mounted) side air bags for the driver/front right passenger positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions. The driverâ€™s frontal deployed as a result of the crash. The case vehicle sustained severe frontal damage as a result of a head-on collision with a 2013 Ford E150 cargo van (Vehicle #2). The crash occurred on a multi-lane north/south roadway, with two level travel lanes in each direction separated by a double yellow line. The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 72 km/h (45 mph). It was daylight and raining as the roads were wet. Vehicle 1 was northbound in the inboard through lane and Vehicle #2 was southbound in the inboard through lane. For some unknown reason Vehicle #1 loss control and crossed over the double yellow line impacting head-on with Vehicle #2. The restrained 24-year-old male driver of the 2015 Mazda 3 (sport), 4-door sedan was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-rearward track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks on the available driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. Following the collision, the restrained driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported from the scene to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of his serious injuries. Vehicle #1 and Vehicle #2 were towed from the crash site.
