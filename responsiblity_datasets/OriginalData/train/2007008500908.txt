When interviewing the driver, he stated several times that the vehicles in lane two had to turn left at the intersection. This is not true. The way that the intersection is laid out, the eastbound lanes are slightly offset on the other side of the intersection. This can lead to confusion while passing through. This was the driver's first time through this road, and he assumed that the roadway became one lane on the other side of the intersection.
