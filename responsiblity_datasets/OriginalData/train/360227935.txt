This frontal impact case involves a 46 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way roadway, during evening hours in darkness, with wet roadway and rainy weather conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, there are no shoulders on either side of the travel lanes. On the east side, there is a grassy embankment that slopes away from the roadway, leading to a ditch that is lined by trees. In the precrash area, the lanes have a slight downhill grade and curve to the right. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Volvo S40 four door sedan, was southbound and was approaching the curve. V1 began negotiating the curve when the driver lost control of the vehicle and departed the roadway to the left. V1 traveled down the embankment and its undercarriage impacted the ditch. V1 continued a short distance south and the front of V1 impacted a tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag. V1 came to final rest near the tree, facing south. Following the crash, V1 caught on fire, resulting in damage to the engine and front row of the passenger compartment. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 46 year old female, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
