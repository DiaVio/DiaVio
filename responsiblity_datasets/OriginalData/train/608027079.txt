The case vehicle a four-door 1997 Nissan Altima was traveling west on a two-lane roadway. It was daylight, there was no adverse weather and the roadway was dry. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Dodge 1500 crew-cab 4x4 pick-up truck was traveling east on the same roadway behind a non-contact vehicle which was making a left turn. The driver of V2 attempted to pass the non-contact vehicle on the right. As V2 passed the non-contact vehicle the right wheels traversed the snow covered roadside and V2 entered a clockwise rotation crossed the center line and entered the path of the case vehicle. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid a collision by braking and steering right. The front of the case vehicle struck the left-side of V2 on the left-rear wheel. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise before it came to a rest straddling the westbound lane, the paved shoulder and the roadside facing southwest. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest straddling the paved shoulder and the roadside facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant, the 34-year-old male driver was not wearing the three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was the sole case vehicle occupant. The driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center.
