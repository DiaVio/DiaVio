The case occupant is a 64 year old female driver, restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a frontal corner impact. The case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, her frontal impact air bag deployed and she sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way north/south roadway, during daylight hours under clear weather conditions and wet roadways. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt travel lanes are level and there are no curbs present. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Subaru Legacy Outback station wagon, was traveling south in the southbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2005 Honda Accord four door sedan, was traveling north in the northbound lane. V1 crossed over the double yellow center lane lines and into V2's travel path. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of the case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of her frontal air bag. V1 was overpowered and rotated counterclockwise as it traveled north, coming to final rest facing east, with its front end on the grassy area adjacent to the northbound lane, and its back end still on the roadway. V2 traveled a short distance north and came to final rest near V1, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 64 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed during the crash. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center where she was hospitalized for forty-one days. No other occupants were in V1. V2's 66 year old female driver and sole occupant was reportedly seriously injured but her treatment status is unknown.
