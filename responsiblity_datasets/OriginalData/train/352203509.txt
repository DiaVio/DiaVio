Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an 87-year old, male driver and an 86-year old, right front female passenger, both of a 2006 Toyota Prius 4-door hatchback, which was involved in a frontal collision with the end termination of a guardrail. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the late afternoon hours (daylight) of a late summer weekday, at the gore area of a two lane eastbound roadway and its southbound deceleration lane (off ramp), within the area of an interchange. This eastbound roadway consists of two eastbound lanes and one deceleration lane (off ramp) for traffic wishing to change trafficways and head south. The roadway forms the eastbound travel direction of an east/west trafficway. At the area of the crash, the eastbound roadway is straight and has a positive uphill grade. At the gore area, two separate guardrail segments join and eventually terminate where the eastbound lanes separate from the southbound deceleration lane (off ramp). The speed limit for the eastbound roadway segment is 55 mph (89 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2006 Toyota Prius 4-door hatchback, was being operated by the 87-year old male driver (case occupant 1). Occupying the right front seating position was an 86-year female passenger (case occupant 2). Both occupants of Vehicle 1 were noted to be utilizing their respective 3-point, lap/shoulder belt restraints (with retractor type pretensioner). Vehicle 1 is also noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, front, seat back mounted side impact air bags and roof side rail curtains. Crash: As Vehicle 1 changed lanes from the eastbound travel lanes to the southbound deceleration off ramp lane, it entered the gore area of the interchange and struck the terminus end of the guardrail with its frontal plane (front left corner area). Vehicle 1 eventually rotated counterclockwise off the struck section of guardrail and eventually came to rest in the southbound ramp lane, facing an unknown direction. As a result of the impact with the guardrail terminus, Vehicle 1's frontal impact air bags deployed and the front, seat belt pretensioners actuated. Post-Crash: Both the driver and right front passenger of Vehicle (case occupants) were removed from the vehicle by responding emergency medical services personnel and transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center. Both case occupants were hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
