This case involves a restrained 26 year old male driver in a 2015 Jeep Compass (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. All airbags deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry asphalt, two-way, five-lane roadway that ran north to south. The center lane was a two-way left turn lane. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 64 kph (40 mph). V1 was traveling north in the left northbound lane negotiating a right curve in the roadway. V1 drifted left across the center lane and into oncoming traffic. After crossing all lanes V1 began to depart the roadway to the left when its front contacted a wooden light pole. V1's impact with the pole caused the pole to yield. V1 began to rotate clockwise after impact with the pole. This rotation caused V1 to trip on the roadside and roll a total of one quarter turn with its left side leading. After V1 came to rest on its left side (right side facing up) the light fixture from the light pole fell onto the right rear of V1. V1 came to rest on the west side of the roadway facing south. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported from the crash scene to a level one trauma center where he received treatment for serious injuries that he sustained in the crash.
