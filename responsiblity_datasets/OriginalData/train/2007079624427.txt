This single vehicle daytime collision occurred early evening on a north/south roadway. The roadway is undivided, dry, asphalt, consists of five lanes, curves left for southbound traffic, and has a -5.7% downgrade slope. The roadway is designated a 72 kmph (45 mph) zone.

Vehicle one (V1) is a 1993 Honda Civic four-door sedan, driven by a seventeen (17) year old male with one passenger. They were traveling southbound in the number one lane. As V1 negotiated the curve, it began to rotate counter-clockwise. V1 traveled across all lanes towards the east curb. The left plane of V1 contacted the east curb. The left plane of V1 then contacted a light pole located east of the east curb. V1 came to rest facing northbound against the pole and was towed from the scene due to major damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn. Inexperience was a factor since it was the driver's first time on the road and he had only been driving for 12 months. The driver & passenger were having a social conversation. They were on a "joy ride" around the neighborhood during a break from work and would return to work after their break.
