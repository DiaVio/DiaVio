This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 36-year-old, male driver with deployed frontal air bags (V1). This occupant sustained serious injuries in a head-on collision with V2. V1 was also occupied by a 17-month-old, female, non-case occupant. She was restrained in a child seat and listed with only minor injury. The non-case occupant driver of v2 had a possible medical condition and died post-crash. The crash occurred mid-morning under cloudy skies on a dry roadway. A 2003 Honda Pilot utility vehicle (V1) was traveling southwest on a suburban, bituminous, three-lane, two-way roadway. The middle lane was designated as a two-way center turn lane. The grade for V1 was 1% downhill. A 2003 Buick Rendezvous utility vehicle (V2) was traveling northeast on the same roadway in the opposite direction negotiating a right curve. The grade for V2's approach was also 1% downhill. As V2 negotiated the right curve, it traveled left across the center turn lane into V1's direction of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on (Event 1). After impact, V1 and V2 came to rest in the roadway near the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 36-year-old male case occupant. He was unbelted, and the available retractor pretensioner was not actuated. The steering wheel and right top instrument panel airbags deployed. The available seatback airbags did not deploy. No curtain airbags were installed. He was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries. V1 was also occupied by a 17-month-old, female, non-case occupant. She was restrained in a child seat in the second row middle position. She sustained only minor injuries. V2 was driven by a 71-year-old, male, non-case occupant. He was transported to a local trauma center where he was pronounced dead.
