Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Toyota Camry Solara Coupe, driven by a 26 year-old female was traveling southbound in lane one. Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Mazda 626 Sedan, driven by a 21 year-old male with one passenger was pulling out from a curbside parking space to merge into the southbound lane of the street. The driver of V1 checked for southbound traffic before pulling from the curb, then stopped upon seeing V2 approaching from the rear. At this point V1 was in the path of V2. The front right corner of V2 impacted the front left of V1 just in front of the driver's side door. V1 was spun clockwise approximately 60 degrees before coming to rest. V2 was deflected to the left and came to rest in the center of the roadway pointing south. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

She was leaving home to go to school and works a 40 hour per week job.
