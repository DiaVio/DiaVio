This case involved a 33 year old female driver of a 2007 Hyundai Sonata four door sedan (V1). The driver of V1 was restrained by the three point lap and shoulder belt system and had a deployed frontal airbag and also a deployed seat mounted left side impact airbag and a deployed left side curtain head impact airbag. There was one other vehicle involved in the crash, a 2003 Kenworth T800 non-CDS tanker truck. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a city street divided by a 4.5 meter concrete median. V1 had a 3% uphill grade and V2 had a 3% downhill grade. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph). Travel speed for both vehicles was unknown. V1 was traveling in the right lane of the northbound lanes and V2 was entering the southbound lanes from the eastbound lanes of the intersecting roadway. As V2 turned right, it traveled across the southbound lanes and continued across the median and struck V1 in a head on configuration. V1 was pushed into the curb with its right front wheel where it remained stationary. V2 then traveled up the hood and onto the top of V1 before it rolled into the grass on the east roadside for final rest on its left side. V1 came to rest against the east curb of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center for treatment of severe injuries sustained in the crash.
