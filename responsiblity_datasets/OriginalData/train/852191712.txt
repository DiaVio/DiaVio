This case occupant is a 69 year old male driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a moderate rollover crash. He sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during the early morning hours on a wet roadway, in darkness with no overhead street lights and clear weather conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Toyota Tacoma Xtracab two door compact pickup, was northbound in lane one of a two lane, two way state highway. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt travel lanes are straight and level with narrow paved shoulders on both sides. Adjacent to the shoulders are shallow sloped areas covered with dense brush, followed by a level area consisting of brush and trees. As the driver of V1 traveled north, he noticed an animal in the roadway ahead of him. The driver steered right and traveled onto the east shoulder. He then steered left, but overcorrected, causing V1 to go into a counterclockwise rotation. V1 traveled across the southbound lane and departed the roadway to the left. While still in a yaw, V1 traveled down the shallow slope, tripped with its right side tires leading and began to rollover to the right. V1 completed three quarter turns before coming to final rest on its left side, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 69 year old male, was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
