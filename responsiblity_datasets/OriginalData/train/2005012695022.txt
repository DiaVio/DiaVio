The driver of V1 at that time had stated that he did not have a driver's license that it had been taken away for a crash that he was responsible for in earlier weeks. He also stated that he had a health problem (mental) but was ok to drive. As I checked on the driver of V2 she stated she was ok but was concerned about her child in the back seat. After the driver got out to check her child and had a chance to move around then she noted her neck and arms were tingly. At that time I asked her to sit in her vehicle till the police arrived.
