There were five southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The roadway was bituminous, straight, and level. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with wet roads and rain. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1997 Isuzu Rodeo with one occupant, was southbound in lane four. V2, a 1997 Honda Civic with one occupant, was also southbound in lane five (HOV lane) slightly behind V1. V1 attempted to change lanes into lane five, in front of V2. Consequently, the front right of V2 made contact with the back left of V1. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a 46-year old male, was not injured. He could not be located for interview. However, the driver stated to police that he was driving in lane four, when the driver of V2 veered into his lane, hitting him from behind.
