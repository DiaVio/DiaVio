This case involves an impact to the front end of a SUV with a tree in a small-overlap mode, off-set to the right. The case occupant is the unrestrained driver of the case vehicle. The case vehicle, a 2013 Jeep Compass SUV, was northbound in the inside lane of a, level, dry, concrete divided four-lane traffic-way, with parking lanes on either side, approaching a crossover to permit traffic to change into the southbound lanes. It was daylight and cloudy. As the driver was beginning to make a U-turn, she experienced a syncope episode and lost control of the case vehicle. The case vehicle drove across the southbound lanes, over the west curb and stuck a 16-cm diameter tree, rotated clockwise and came to rest facing northwest straddling the road side and the southbound parking lane. The unrestrained 49-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. She sustained moderate injuries requiring surgery and was transported to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
