BACKGROUND:

Description:

This case was initiated in response to a report of two drivers, a 23 year old male (fatal) and a 39 year old female, being injured in a two vehicle crash; the female being admitted to a trauma center. The 23 year old male is 173.0 centimeters (68.0 in) in height and weighs 68 kilograms (149 lbs.). The 39 year old female is 170.0 centimeters (67.0 in) in height and weighs 109 kilograms (240 lbs.). Vehicle 1 (case vehicle #1) was a 2000 Hyundai Tiburon and Vehicle 2 (case vehicle #2) was a 1998 Toyota 4-Runner. This is a double case, with each case occupant occupying a separate vehicle.

Collision Type:

A vehicle vs. vehicle (head-on configuration)

TECHNICAL SUMMARY:

This two-vehicle collision occurred on a two-lane roadway. The posted speed limit for Vehicles 1 and 2 was 89 KPH (55 MPH). Vehicle 1 was traveling westbound on a straight and level travel lane. Vehicle 2 was traveling eastbound on a curved (right curve) and level travel lane prior to the collision. The roadway surface for both travel directions were free of any defects; however, the weather condition was raining and the roadway was wet.

Vehicle 1, a 2000 Hyundai Tiburon, was being driven westbound on the east/west roadway by the 23 year old male driver (case occupant #1). The driver was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder restraint along with the a driver's frontal air bag that deployed during the crash.

Vehicle 2, a 1998 Toyota 4-Runner, was being driven eastbound on the east/west roadway by a 39 year old female driver (case occupant #2). The driver was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder restraint along with the a driver's frontal air bag that deployed during the crash with Vehicle 1.

The collision between Vehicles 1 and 2 occurred when the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of his vehicle and crossed over the center line of the roadway and entered into the eastbound travel lane. Vehicle 1 struck Vehicle 2's front end with its frontal plane (head-on configuration) in Vehicle 2's travel lane.

The estimated Delta V for Vehicle 1 (case vehicle #1), for this impact with Vehicle 2, was computed, using WinSMASH, as 56 kilometers per hour (35 MPH). Vehicle 1 was assigned a Collision Deformation Classification (CDC) of 12FYEW4 and a Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) of 350 degrees. The maximum crush depth was 79.0 centimeters (31.1 in.) located at C2.

The estimated Delta V for Vehicle 2 (case vehicle #2) for this impact with Vehicle 1 was computed, using WinSMASH, as 36 kilometers per hour (22 MPH). Vehicle 1 was assigned a Collision Deformation Classification (CDC) of 12FDEW3 and a Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) of 010 degrees. The maximum crush depth was 64.0 centimeters (25.2 in.) located at C1.

As a result of this impact, Vehicle 1 (case vehicle #1) was pushed backward and rotated counterclockwise. Vehicle 1 traveled to the center of the roadway where it came to a final rest position, east of the point of impact, facing south. Vehicle 2 (case vehicle #2) rotated counterclockwise continuing to travel off the south side of the roadway and down an embankment. Vehicle 2 contacted a tree, in a sideswipe type impact, with its left rear corner (CDC of 06LBHS2). As the vehicle continued traveling backward down the embankment, it struck the same tree with its left rear door with the contact continuing forward into the left front door area in a sideswipe type distribution (CDC of 06LPAS2). Vehicle 2 came to a final rest position off the south side of the roadway, against the tree, facing northwest.

The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant #1) sustained fatal injuries (fatal at scene). The driver of Vehicle 2 (case occupant #2) sustained minor to moderate injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 (case occupant 2) was transported to a trauma center where she was admitted for treatment and observation.

Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in this collision.
