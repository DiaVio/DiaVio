This case involved the 61 year old restrained female driver of a 2007 Toyota Yaris four door compact sedan (V1). The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 1999 Honda Civic four door sedan (V2). The driver of V1 (our case occupant) was restrained by the three point manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. There was a 13 year old male seated in the right front of V1. He was not using the available safety belts, but had a deployed frontal airbag. There were two occupants in the 2nd row. In the left rear position was a 2 year old male restrained in a forward facing child safety seat secured by the latch and tether system. In the right rear seat there was a 4 year old male seated in a booster seat with the vehicle's lap and shoulder belt being used. The crash occurred at dusk on a straight and level higway with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes divided by a grass median. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The crash occurred at an uncontrolled intersection and the posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was traveling south in the left turn lane attempting to turn onto the intersecting roadway. V2 was traveling north in the right lane at an unknown speed when V1 turned left into the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1, causing V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 90 degrees and travel off the east side of the road. V2 also rotated clockwise about 90 degrees and came to rest in the left northbound lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to the severity of her injuries. The front right passenger was also transported by ground to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for one day. The two rear seat occupants were treated and released from the emergency department of the trauma center.
