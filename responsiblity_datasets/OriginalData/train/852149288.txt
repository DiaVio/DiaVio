This near-side impact crash involved a 68 year old restrained female seated in the front left position with a frontal air bag deployment who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred at a traffic signal controlled intersection during the early evening dark hours. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions, the bituminous travel lanes were dry and the roadways were illuminated by street lights. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Honda Civic two door coupe, was traveling south in lane one on a two lane, two way, undivided street and crossing straight through the intersection. Vehicle two (V2) was a 2005 Kia Sedona minivan was traveling west in lane one on a two lane, two way street and was also proceeding through the intersection straight. The front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 then rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise, and its right rear tire struck the north curb, debeading the tire and denting the rim. V1 departed the street backwards up and over the curb on to a grassy surface and the back of V1 impacted a tree where it came to final rest facing northeast against the tree. After the initial impact, V2 rotated approximately 160 degrees counterclockwise and came to final rest near the southwest corner, facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant was seated in the front left seat using the available manual lap/shoulder belt with the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the case vehicle.
