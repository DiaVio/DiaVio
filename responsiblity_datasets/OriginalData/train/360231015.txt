This severe frontal crash involves a case occupant who is a 45 year old female driver. She was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, had a frontal air bag deployment, and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Nissan Sentra four door sedan, was southbound in lane two on a four lane, one way freeway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Toyota Camry four door sedan, was traveling south on a freeway on-ramp. As the on-ramp joins up with the freeway, a fifth southbound travel lane is added. In the area where the crash occurred, the concrete lanes are straight and level, but the freeway on-ramp that V2 was traveling on curves to the right and has a downhill grade. As V2 negotiated the curve, the driver lost control of the vehicle. The driver of V2 overcorrected and the vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise as it traveled across the southbound freeway lanes. V2 traveled into V1's lane and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the frontal air bags. V1 continued south and came to final rest straddling the third and fourth lane line, facing south. After the initial impact, V2 continued in a southeasterly direction and its back right impacted a jersey barrier before coming to final rest in lane five, facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 45 year old female, restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a steering column mounted front air bag deployment. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
