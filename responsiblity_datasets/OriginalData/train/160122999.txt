V1, a 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser four door sedan and the case vehicle, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. V1 was negotiating an S curve to the left and then the right and V1 departed the roadway to the right. V1 attempted to correct but began a counterclockwise yaw and crossed both lanes before departing the roadway to the left side where it hit two trees with its right side. V1 then continued down a steep embankment where it struck two trees with its left side and came to final rest. The driver of V1, a 20-year-old male and sole occupant, was wearing a lap and shoulder belt and both frontal air bags deployed. The passenger side seat mounted thorax bag deployed but the driver side did not. V1 was towed due to damage and the driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center with serious injuries.
