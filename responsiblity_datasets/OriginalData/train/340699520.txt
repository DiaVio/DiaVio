The 178 cm/ 89 kg (5' 10"/ 197 lbs. BMI 28.3), 35-year-old male driver of the 2010 two-door Chevrolet Cobalt was unrestrained by a three-point belt, but had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. During the severe, 12 o'clock, frontal impact with a 2007 BMW X5 compact utility vehicle, the case occupant moved forward relative to the vehicle interior. The chest abrasion, the sternum fracture, the left 1st to 5th and right 1st to 6th rib fractures, the bilateral lung contusions, and the pericardium and left atrium lacerations are due to contact with the steering-wheel assembly via the air bag. The distal bilateral thigh contusions are from an unknown source. The abrasions to the bilateral knees are due to contact with the knee bolster.
