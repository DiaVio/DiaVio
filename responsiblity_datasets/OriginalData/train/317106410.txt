This case involved the 46 year old restrained male driver of a 2007 Toyota Camry four door sedan (V1). The driver of V1 was restrained by the available three point lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag and a deployed knee bolster airbag. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a multi-lane divided trafficway that intersected with another roadway. The dry asphalt roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 64 kph (40 mph). At the intersection, the right lane curved to the right and was separated from the adjacent lanes by a concrete traffic island. V1 was traveling west in the right lane at a reported speed of 89 kph (55 mph). As V1 approached the intersection, it continued in a forward motion and traveled onto the concrete island striking a traffic light pole with its frontal plane. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest next to the pole. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The case subject was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center due to injuries sustained in the crash.
