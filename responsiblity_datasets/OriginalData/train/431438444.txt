This frontal crash involves a 52 year old restrained female seated in the front left (Driver) seating position with a non deployed steering wheel mounted air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred in the morning hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two lane (one way) entrance ramp within the confines of an interchange. There are two northbound travel lanes (with shoulders on both sides) and the entire ramp curves to the left. At the area of impact there is a greater than 2% negative slope. The case vehicle (V1), a 2006 two-door Ford Mustang, was being driven northbound in the right lane at the time of the crash. There was an unknown non-contact vehicle traveling in the left lane parallel to V1. Vehicle #1 was traveling northbound in the right lane and an unknown non-contact vehicle was also traveling northbound in the left lane. As the non-contact vehicle attempted to change lanes it cut off our case vehicle causing it to swerve partially off the roadway and onto the right shoulder. V1 traveled back across both northbound lanes and off the left shoulder before impacting its front left bumper with a concrete barrier. V1 continued on side slapping its left rear with the concrete barrier before traveling to its final resting position on the left shoulder facing north. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 52 year old female case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt. The retractor type pretensioners did actuate but the available steering wheel air bag did not deploy as a result of the crash. This case occupant's seat was positioned between middle and forward most position and the seat back was in the upright position. The case occupant was seriously injured in the crash and transported to a level 1 trauma center for treatment of her injuries sustained in the crash.
