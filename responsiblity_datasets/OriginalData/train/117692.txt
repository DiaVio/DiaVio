The case occupant is the 178 cm, 159 kg (5 ft 10 in, 350 lb) male driver of a 2003 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle that departed the left side of the road and struck a large tree (100 cm diameter) with the front end. The impact was classified as severe and the WinSmash reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 53 kmph (33 mph) which appeared to be consistent with the observed vehicle damage. The driver was not using the available 3-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed.



On impact the driver moved forward and slightly to the right in response to the 12 o'clock direction of force, possible pre-impact steering manuever, and post-impact rotation. He sustained a loss of consciousness, anterior scalp abrasions and facial contusions from contact with the rearview mirror. He sustained two left rib fractures (#3 and #8 posterior) from contact with the right side of the steering-wheel rim and three right rib fractures (#4-6 lateral) and a right pulmonary contusion from contact with the center instrument panel. He sustained fractures to the left distal radius and left distal ulna (styloid) probably from interaction/contact with the steering wheel rim. He sustained bilateral inferior and superior pubic rami fractures, a left iliac wing fracture, a right fibula fracture, and a right acetabular fracture from contact with the knee bolster. He sustained a right tibial plateau fracture from contact with the knee bolster in combination with lower leg contact with the floor pan. He also sustained a right patellar tendon avulsion from contact with the knee bolster. The case occupant expired 9 days post-crash due to complications of his injuries (pulmonary embolism).
