This two-vehicle collision occurred during evening hours on a weeknight. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a four-lane, two-way, north-south, bituminous roadway in a residential area. Private driveways intersect both sides of the street and vehicles are legally parked along both curb lines. The speed limit on this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph) in both directions. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Honda Civic 2-door coupe, was traveling northbound in the first lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Honda Accord 4-door sedan, was legally parked along the east curb, ahead of V1. V1 veered right and entered the parking lane, where the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. V1 and V2 moved ahead and came to rest in the parking lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 20-year-old male driver of V1 could not be interviewed; after leaving the hospital, he entered inpatient drug rehabilitation treatment. The police reported that they suspected that the driver of V1 was intoxicated, and administered a BAC test. The test revealed no alcohol presence. The driver of V1 then reported to police that he is being treated for anxiety, and takes Xanax, Valium, and Suboxone. Suboxone is used to treat pain-killer addiction. The driver reported to police that he reached down to retrieve his cell phone and veered off the road. A witness reported that a non-contact vehicle caused V1 to veer off, but the driver of V1 did not report the presence of any non-contact vehicle.

The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the right side of travel. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded as a driver-related recognition error: internal distraction.
