The focus of this case is on an 33-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2005 Subaru Forester (V1), involved in a frontal impact crash with a 2005 Ford Escape (V2). The collision occurred during the early morning hours (dark), of an autumn weekday (Thursday), in the northbound lanes of a north/south limited access expressway. The four bituminous travel lanes for this highway run north/south with a large grassy median between. The weather was foggy and drizzling and the roadway surface was wet. The speed limit for the highway is 112 km/h (70 mph). The 33-year old female driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the right northhbound travel lane. She was wearing her 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag and a head-thorax side side impact air bag. For unknown reasons, V2 entered the northbound travel lanes traveling southbound. Subsequently V2 impacted V1 in an offset frontal crash configuration. After the initial impact, V2 rotated counter clockwise and continued traveling southbound, exiting the northbound travel lanes into the median and came to final rest pointed in a southerly direction. After the initial impact with V2, V1 continued traveling northbound, exiting the roadway into the right shoulder. V1 continued down a long sloping embankment off of the right shoulder while rotating counterclockwise, coming to final rest against a small tree pointed in a westerly direction. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by ground due to the fog, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. The driver V2 was transported to a local medical facility. The extent of his injuries and/or treatments is unknown. Both vehicles were towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
