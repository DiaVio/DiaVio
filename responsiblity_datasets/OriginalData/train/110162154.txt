The focus of this case is on a 54-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2006 Honda Civic EX (V1), involved in a side impact crash followed by a rollover. This single vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours (daylight), of a spring day, on a curved flat two lane east/west bituminous road. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. The speed limit for the road is 56 km/h (35 mph). For an unknown reason, V1 departed the eastbound travel lane to the right. The driver of V1 then steered back onto the eastbound lane but overcorrected and crossed the westbound lane in a counterclockwise yaw. V1 then departed the north edge of the westbound travel lane where it contacted a road side sign in the right front fender (impact #1). V1 continued down an embankment until the right lower sill of V1 contact a large log (impact #2). The impact with the log caused V1 to trip and begin a passenger side leading roll. Impact #2 pushed the log further down the slope and V1 rolled along the length of the log contacting the far end of the log with the top of the trunk lid after 2 quarter turns. V1 completed one more quarter turn (total of 3 quarter turns) and came to rest pointed in a northwesterly direction. The case occupant was removed from the vehicle by rescue personnel and transported to the trauma center by ground. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
