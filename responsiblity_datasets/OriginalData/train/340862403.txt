The case vehicle, an SUV, was struck on its right side by the front of another SUV. As a consequence of this minor impact, the case vehicle flipped over one quarter-turn onto its left side. The case occupant is the driver of the case vehicle. The case vehicle, a 2015 Honda Pilot SUV, was southbound in the outside lane of a one-way, dry, level, concrete, two-lane roadway, approaching a controlled intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Honda Pilot SUV was eastbound in the inside lane of the intersecting, divided, four-lane trafficway, approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle in the area of the right-rear wheel. As a consequence of this minor impact, the case vehicle rotated clockwise toward the southeast corner of the intersection, flipped over left side leading and struck a utility box with its left fender before it came to rest on its left side facing southwest. It was daylight and clear. The restrained 36-year-old female driver and the restrained 21-year-old female right passenger both had the benefit of deployed side-impact curtain air bags. The right-front passenger also had the benefit of a deployed seat-back mounted air bag. The 15-month-old female, left-second-row passenger was reportedly in a child-safety system as was the 4-month-old, left-third-row passenger. Both of these occupants had the benefit of a deployed curtain air bag. The remaining occupant was the restrained 11-year-old male, middle- third-row passenger. The driver was reportedly driving with her arm outside of the open left-front window at the time of impact. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and was enrolled as a case occupant. None of the other occupants were reported as injured, treated on-scene or transported to a medical facility.
