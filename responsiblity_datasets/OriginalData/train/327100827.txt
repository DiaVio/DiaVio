This case involves a moderate right 'far-side', 'L-type' impact between a passenger car and the front-end of a SUV. The case occupant is the 80-year-old female driver. She was restrained by an integrated three-point belt, but the frontal and side impact air bags at her seat position did not deploy. The case vehicle (V1), a 2005 four-door Cadillac DeVille was eastbound approaching a four-legged intersection on a dry, level, asphalt roadway. It was daylight and clear. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2008 Ford Explorer Sport Trac SUV was northbound approaching the same intersection. As V1 crossed the intersection it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 contacted the right side of the case vehicle causing it to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise. As the vehicles rotated, the left rear of V2 contacted the right rear side of V1 in a 'side-slap' type impact. V1 came to rest facing northeast while V2 rotated approximately 70 degrees and came to rest facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 80-year-old female driver of case vehicle was the sole occupant. She was restrained by a three-point belt. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
