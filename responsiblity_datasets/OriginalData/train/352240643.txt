Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 66-year-old female driver of a 2005 Ford Escape compact utility vehicle and a 72-year-old male driver of a 2012 Mazda 5 station wagon, both of which were involved in a head-on collision (frontal, corner impact). Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours, of a fall weekday, on a curved and graded two-lane east/west roadway, just east of a hillcrest. This roadway has a slight left turning curve, for the eastbound travel direction and a positive uphill grade for the westbound direction. The roadway has a speed limit of 45 mph (72 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was reported to be wet. Vehicle 1, the 2005 Ford Escape compact utility vehicle, was being operated by the 66-year-old female driver (case occupant 1), in the eastbound travel lane. She was restrained by her respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags. Occupying the left rear seating position was a 2-year-old male passenger. He was restrained by a 5-point harness in a forward facing child seat, which was secured to the vehicle seating area by the vehicle's seat belt restraint, latch anchors and a tether. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the graded and curved section of the roadway and continue traveling eastbound. Vehicle 2, the 2012 Mazda 5 station wagon, was being operated by the 72-year-old male driver (case occupant 2), in the westbound travel lane. He was restrained by his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags, seat back mounted side impact air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 2 was in the process of negotiating the graded and curved section of the roadway and intended to continue traveling westbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 drifted left and entered the westbound travel lane just as it crested the hill area. As a result, the front left corner area of Vehicle 1 struck the front left corner of Vehicle 2 (event 1). Vehicle 2 subsequently rotated counterclockwise out of the impact and ascended a roadside embankment where it struck a small tree/shrub with its left rear corner area (minor impact) before coming to rest, facing an easterly direction. Vehicle 1 continued eastbound and eventually overturned. Vehicle 1 rolled an unknown number of times before coming to rest, on its roof, at the north roadside edge, facing a northerly direction. As a result of the initial vehicle to vehicle impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2. Post-Crash: Both drivers were extricated from their respective vehicles by responding fire/rescue and emergency medical services personnel. They were both transported from the scene, by air unit, to a regional trauma center. Both drivers were hospitalized with minor to serious injuries, while the 2-year-old male passenger of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital, treated and released. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
