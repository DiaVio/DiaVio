Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, 2-door coupe was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way dirt road. It was dark, there were no streetlights, the weather was clear, and the dirt road was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver made a sudden right steering input and V1 departed the right side of the road. V1 struck a tree with the left-front bumper and came to rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 24-year-old male driver (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The 49-year-old male right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. The 40-year-old male left-rear passenger was not using the available three-point seat belt. The 38-year-old male right-rear passenger was also not using the available three-point seat belt. The driver (case occupant) was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center. The three passengers of the case vehicle were transported via ground ambulance to a different level-one trauma center.
