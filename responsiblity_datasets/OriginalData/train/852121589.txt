This crash occurred during daylight hours at an intersection. It was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle (V1), a 2002 Pontiac Grand AM GT four door sedan, was stopped northbound at a stop sign on a two lane, two way street to make a left turn at the intersection with a two lane, two way highway that had no traffic controls for this intersection. As V1 entered the intersection, the front of vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford Ranger pickup truck traveling eastbound, impacted the left side of V1. Both V1 and V2 rotated counterclockwise post impact. V1 rotated 180 degrees and came to final rest on the northeast corner of the intersection and V2 rotated 90 degrees to the east where the right side of V2 then impacted the front of a westbound vehicle three (V3), a full size sedan that was stopped in the lane waiting to make a left turn. V2 came to final rest facing northwest in the westbound lane east of the intersection with its right side still up against the front of V3. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only person in V1. The case occupant was a 18 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and no air bags deployed. She sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. V1 was disabled and towed from the scene, and V2's frontal air bags did not deploy and V2 was not reported as being towed.
