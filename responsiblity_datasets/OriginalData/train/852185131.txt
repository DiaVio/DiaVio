The case occupant is a 24 year old female driver, restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a severe frontal collision with frontal and side air bag deployments who sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred on a two way, interstate freeway during daylight hours with rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of three east and three westbound level concrete travel lanes, separated by an elevated grassy center median. The travel lanes curve to the left and have a slight uphill grade for westbound vehicles and are level with a curve to the right for eastbound vehicles. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Honda Civic two door coupe, was traveling west in lane three of three. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Acura 3.5RL four door sedan, was traveling east in lane three of three. V1 and V2 were negotiating the curve when V2 departed the roadway to the left and crossed over the grassy median and entered V1's lane of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal, side seatback and side roof rail curtain air bags. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest facing southeast in lane two. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest on the south shoulder of the westbound lanes, facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 24 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's frontal steering column mounted air bag, seat back mounted side air bag and left roof side rail mounted curtain air bag all deployed during the crash. She sustained critical injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. No other occupants were in V1.
