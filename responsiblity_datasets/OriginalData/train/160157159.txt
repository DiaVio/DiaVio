The focus of this case is on a 34-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser (V1), involved in a side impact with a tree followed by a rollover. This single vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of an autumn weekday (Wednesday), on a straight level section of a two-lane roadway. This bituminous roadway runs north and south. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for the north/south roadway is 80 km/h (50 mph). The 34-year old female driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the southbound travel lane. She was not wearing her 3-point lap/shoulder belt but had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag. For unknown reasons, V1 crossed the centerline and then exited the east edge of the roadway. V1 continued travel off of the east edge of the roadway until contacting the trunk of large diameter tree with the front section of the left side plane of the vehicle. As a result of the impact, V1's driver frontal impact air bag and the passenger frontal impact air bag deployed. V1 rolled one quarter turn, passenger side leading, through the shallow off roadway ditch and then rotated one more quarter turn onto the top of the vehicle as it reentered the east edge of the roadway. V1 continued to slide across the two-lane roadway in a southwesterly direction until exiting the west edge of the roadway and coming to rest in the shallow ditch along the west edge of the roadway. V1 remained on its roof in the ditch at final rest, pointed in a southerly direction in the ditch. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported by medical transport to a trauma center and hospitalized serious injuries. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
