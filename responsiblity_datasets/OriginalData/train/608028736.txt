The case vehicle a 4-door 2001 Jeep Cherokee SUV was westbound in the outside lane of a six-lane divided highway. It was daylight, there was no adverse weather, but the asphalt roadway was wet. A non-contact vehicle was in the center westbound lane. The non-contact vehicle began to merge into the outside lane and began to encroach on the case vehicle. The driver of the case vehicle veered right onto the concrete shoulder to avoid a collision. As the driver attempted to steer back onto the roadway he lost control of the case vehicle, drove across the three westbound lanes and impacted a concrete median barrier head-on. The case vehicle came to rest on the paved shoulder against the median barrier facing south. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. The only occupant was the 32-year-old male driver. He was restrained only by the deployed steering-wheel airbag. He transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
