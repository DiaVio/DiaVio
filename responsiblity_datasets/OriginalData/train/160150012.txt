This far-side crash involves a 43-year-old restrained female driver with deployed frontal and right side air bag deployment who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred at the intersection of a two lane, one-way roadway and a three lane, one-way roadway. The intersection is level and is controlled by a traffic light. The case vehicle (V1), a 2004 Honda CR-V utility vehicle, was traveling north in lane one of the two lane, one-way roadway and was approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Toyota 4-Runner utility vehicle, was traveling west in lane one of the three lane, one-way roadway and was approaching the same intersection. V1 and V2 both entered the intersection and the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. After initial impact, the left side of V2 contacted the right side of V1 in a sideslap impact. V1 came to rest on the roadway to the east of the intersection, while V2 came to rest off of the northeast section of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 43-year-old female case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. Both frontal air bags deployed and the right side, seat-mounted thorax bag also deployed. The case occupant went home after the crash and later came to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
