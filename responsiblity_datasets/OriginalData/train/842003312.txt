This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 21 year old male front right passenger of a 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier 2-door coupe. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed during a rollover (event #2). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a 4-lane divided interstate highway and negotiating a right curve in the inboard travel lane. The driver allowed the vehicle to depart the left (east) pavement edge and enter the center (grass) median area. As V1 entered the median area, the front left area impacted a reflector post resulting in minor damage (event #1). Driver steering input resulted in a clockwise rotation as the vehicle traversed the center median. The left side wheels began digging into the soft soil. The lateral motion against the soft soil tipped the vehicle's center of gravity outboard of its wheels. This tripping mechanism initiated a 4-quarter turn left side rollover ("tripover"), which resulted in severe top damage (event #2). The police reported that Vehicle 1 came to rest (on its wheels) in the center median facing southwest. The 21 year old male driver was reported by police as unrestrained and fully ejected (through the left front area) during the rollover. The driver came to rest approximately 4 meters south of the vehicle final rest position. The 21 year old male front right passenger was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system, with the seat track adjusted to a full rearward position. Following the crash, both occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and hospitalized. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
