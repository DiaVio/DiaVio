This single vehicle daytime collision occurred during early morning hours. The collision occurred at a four-leg intersection comprised by north/south roadway and an east/west roadway. The north/south roadway is undivided, dry, level, asphalt, and consists of three lanes. The east/west roadway is undivided, dry, level, asphalt, and consists of five lanes. The north/south roadway is designated a 40 kmph (25 mph) zone. The east/west roadway is designated a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone. The intersection is controlled by on-color signals that were functioning at the time of the collision.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier four-door sedan driven by a thirty four (34) year old male with one passenger, was traveling eastbound in the number one lane. As V1 attempted to turn right very late. It traveled towards the southeast corner and departed the left side of the cross street. The front plane of V1 contacted the eastern curb as it proceeded unto the sidewalk. The front plane of V1 then contacted a on-color signal pole. V1 came to rest on the eastern sidewalk facing southbound. V1 received major damage and was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

Both the driver and the occupant refused to provide an interview. The driver of V1 was under the influence. His alcohol level was reported by police to be 0.27, approximately one hour after the collision.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning right at Intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: poor directional control (e.g., failure to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected. The coding was chosen because the decision to turn was made after the driver had traveled about half way through the intersection before attempting the turn & then lost control. An associative factor was coded as too fast for curve/turn. The skid marks show that V1 turned too wide due to his speed.
