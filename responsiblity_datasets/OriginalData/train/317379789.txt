This case involved a 67 year old restrained female driver of a 2012 Honda CRV utility vehicle (V1). The driver of V1 was restrained by the available 3-point safety belt. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The driver's frontal, outboard seat mounted airbag and both side curtains deployed during the crash. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 2006 Nissan Frontier pick-up (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours at the intersection of a two-lane rural roadway and a seven lane divided traffic way. All relevant travel lanes were dry asphalt with positive grades. The two lane roadway ran north to south, had a posted speed of 72 kph (45 mph), and was controlled by stop signs. The seven lane road ran east to west with a posted speed of 105 kph (65 mph) and was not controlled by signs or signals. V1 was traveling east in lane two of the seven-lane divided road approaching the intersection. V2 was traveling south attempting to crossover the median and turn left into the eastbound lanes. As V2 entered the eastbound lanes, the right front corner of V2 contacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise after impact. The driver of V1 steered left in an attempt to keep his vehicle on the roadway. This manuever caused V1 to counterclockwise and contact a stop sign with its right rear door. V1 continued northeast and re-enter the roadway in lane one of the eastbound lanes. V1 faced north at final rest. V2 rotated counterclockwise after impact and came to rest on the roadway. V2 came to rest in the eastbound lanes facing northeast. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment of injuries sustained in the crash.
