The crash occurred at an intersection in the westbound lane of a two-way, rural roadway. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) and a downhill grade of 3% approaching the intersection in the westbound direction. Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies. The setting was morning hours on a weekday.

Vehicle one was a 1996 Suzuki X-90 compact sport utility traveling westbound in lane one, approaching the intersection. V1 crossed over the intersection and departed the right side of the roadway. V1 then contacted a wooden fence post with its front plane. V1 continued into a medium-sized tree with its front plane. V1 came to final rest against the tree in the northwest roadside of the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

V1 was driven by a 31-year old female who was transported to a local trauma center with possible injuries. The driver refused to be interviewed despite having received two official letters regarding the NMVCCS study. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 72 kmp (45 mph). The compact sport utility was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason was a performance error of poor directional control. There were several associated factors present for this driver which were obtained from the medical report. The driver was unemployed, living at home with her parents, and had lost custody of her child. She had a history of depression, kidney disease, and heroin/cocaine use. She was taking the tranquilizer at the time of the crash and scene evidence led paramedics to suspect an overdose. The driver was restrained for a suicide watch after being taken to the emergency room. She was later transferred to a mental health facility.
