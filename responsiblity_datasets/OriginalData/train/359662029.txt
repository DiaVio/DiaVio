This moderate severity frontal crash involved a 71 year old female passenger in the front right seat. She was belted and sustained injuries and was transported to the trauma center. This frontal crash involved four vehicles in a chain reaction with front and rear end impacts. It occurred during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions on a two lane off ramp from four southbound freeway lanes. Southbound lane four was a dedicated lane that would become lane two of the off ramp lanes. Lane three allows vehicles to either exit onto the off ramp lanes, or continue in southbound lane three. All four vehicles involved in this rear end chain reaction crash had exited to the off ramp from the southbound lane 3 and were decelerating. Case vehicle one (V1), 2008 Chevrolet Suburban, was following V3, a 2014 Chevrolet Suburban, that was following vehicle four (V4), a 2014 Toyota RAV-4. All three of these vehicles were decelerating due to slowing traffic ahead. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Freightliner M2 106 county garbage truck, was travelling behind V1. The front of V2 impacted the back of V1. V1 was forced forward and the front of V1 impacted the back of V3. V3 was then forced forward and the front of V3 impacted the back of V4. All involved vehicles came to final rest in the same lane and all of the vehicles were driven from the scene. The case occupant is the front right passenger of case vehicle one who is 71 year old female who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. She sustained chest injuries and was transported to the trauma center. Other occupants in V1 were a restrained 76 year old male driver, and a restrained 13 year old male in the second left seat. Both were reportedly not injured or treated.
