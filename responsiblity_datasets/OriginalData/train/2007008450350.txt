The crash occurred on the eastbound roadside of a two lane undivided roadway. There was one eastbound and one westbound lane. This was a straight, uphill (10 percent grade) bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 40 KMPH (25 MPH). It was morning on a weekday and the road was dry and skies were clear. Traffic flow was very light and moving freely.

V1, a 2000 Nissan Pathfinder sport utility, was traveling east. The driver noticed a deer in the field to his right. As he watched the deer, the deer entered the roadway and the driver steered right and applied his brakes, locking them up. Upon steering right, the driver struck a telephone pole and embankment with the front right end of the vehicle. The vehicle came to rest just within 2 meters of the pole. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

V1, the Nissan Pathfinder, was driven by a 33-year-old male who reported no injuries. He advised he was on his way to work and noticed the deer in the field to his right. The deer entered the roadway and the driver tried to swerve out of the way but ended up striking the pole and embankment.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling off the right side of the road edge. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was driver related, incorrect evasive action. Had the driver braked immediately upon seeing the deer, he could have avoided it without steering off the road. Instead, the driver watched the deer while continuing forward, even though he suspected that the deer would enter the roadway. An associated factor was the external factor of the deer.
