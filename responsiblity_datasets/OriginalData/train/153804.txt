Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Honda Civic, 2-door coupe was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching an S-curve with a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chrysler Town & Country van was traveling north in the northbound lane and approaching the same intersection. Two non-contact passenger vehicles were also southbound in the southbound lane, in front of V1 and both were stopped at the intersection (the lead non-contact vehicle was signaling a left turn and yielding for the approaching V2). It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. As the driver of V1 entered the S-curve she noticed the stopped vehicles in front of her but was unable to brake due to her shoe (high heels) getting snagged in the foot controls. The driver of V1 then moved into the left, northbound lane to avoid striking the stopped vehicles. The driver of V2 who had just passed through the intersection was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 24-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The case occupant was noted to be pregnant with a gestational age of approximately 4-5 weeks.
