This case involved a 17 year old restrained female driver of a 2008 Chevrolet Cobalt two door coupe (V1). She was involved in a near side collision with a 2008 Ford Taurus X four door wagon (V2). The driver of V1 was restrained by the three point manual safety belts and had a deployed left side curtain head impact airbag. There were no other occupants in V1. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a five lane asphalt roadway with the center lane being a turn lane only for both directions of travel. The roadway was straight with a 5% grade with the eastbound lanes being positive and the westbound negative. It was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. V2 was going west in the second lane on the downhill grade reportedly traveling at the posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). There was a non-contact vehicle, a tractor trailer truck pulling one trailer, stopped in the first (right) westbound lane. V1 was southbound exiting a private business driveway onto the roadway in an attempt to travel east. V1 crossed over the right westbound lane in front of the stopped vehicle and continued into the second westbound lane in the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise and the two vehicles sideslapped with V1's left side to V2's left side. V1 continued into the center lane for final rest. V2 came to rest in the right westbound lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center.
