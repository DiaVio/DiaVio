This case involves a SUV that struck an embankment with a consequent primarily end-over-end rollover. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the SUV. The case vehicle, a 2008 Honda Pilot SUV, was northbound on dry, level, two-lane, asphalt roadway. The driver reportedly experienced a sycopal episode and the vehicle departed the road off of the east edge, entered a shallow ditch, struck the embankment of a private drive, rolled primarily end-over-end with some longitudinal rotation and landed on the left roof side-rail before it came to rest facing southwest on a private lawn. It was daylight and clear. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the restrained 59-year-old male driver. He had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact, seatback mounted and roof side-rail curtain air bags. The driver sustained serious injuries and was initially transported to an outside hospital, before he was transferred to level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
