Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Ford Escape, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and drifted off the right edge of the pavement, this caused him to wake up and steer to the left. The rapid steering input caused v1 to enter in a slight counterclockwise yaw. As V1 continued southbound, the counterclockwise yaw began to increase and V1 crossed the centerline, the northbound lane and departed the left side of the roadway. The front of V1 struck a tree (40-cm in diameter) in an oblique manner and uprooted/knocked down the tree. V1 rotated counterclockwise, separated from the tree and came to rest south of the tree, off the east side of the road facing north-northeast. The engine of V1 was torn free from its mounts and was reportedly found laying in the southbound lane, downstream from the crash site. The 22-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
