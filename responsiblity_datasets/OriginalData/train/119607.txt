Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser, 5-door station wagon was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was daylight, sleeting, and the bituminous roadway was icy. The driver of V1 attempted to pass an unknown, slower moving vehicle by overtaking it on the left side but the driver lost control on the icy surface. V1 departed the left side of the road and struck a large tree (61-cm diameter) with the front bumper. The 38-year-old female driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
