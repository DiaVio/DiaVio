The crash occurred on an undivided north/south four-lane roadway near an uncontrolled "Y" intersection. There were two lanes in each direction. North of the intersection the roadway was divided by a raised curb median between the yellow lines. The roadway grade at pre-impact and impact was downhill greater than two percent and curved to the right. The bituminous roadway had a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday evening, the weather was clear, and the roadway was dry.

V1, a 1999 Ford Explorer utility vehicle with the driver as the sole occupant, was traveling southbound. V1 was approaching the intersection in lane number two. Traffic had stopped for vehicles turning left. Per the police report, the driver of V1 swerved to the right to avoid the vehicles, and then swerved left and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle rolled 4-quarter turns, landing on all four tires before departing the roadway and traveling approximately 39.9 meters. V1 came to final rest after its front contacted a tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of the Ford Explorer, a 19 year-old male, was transported to the hospital for unknown injuries. An interview was not obtained although numerous attempts were made. Voicemail messages were left on the driver's cell phone as well as messages with other family members.
