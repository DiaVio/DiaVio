This case involves a small-overlap between the left front-end of a SUV and the left front-end of a passenger car. The occupants of both vehicles are case occupants. The case occupant in vehicle one is 60-year-old female driver of the SUV. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel and side curtain air bags deployed. The case occupant in vehicle two is the 38-year-old female driver of the passenger car. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle one (V1) a 2008 Jeep Liberty SUV was northbound on a dry, level, two-lane, asphalt road. Case vehicle two (V2) a four-door, 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix was southbound on the same road. It was dark, but not lighted and cloudy. For unknown reasons V1 crossed the centerline and entered the path of travel of V2. The driver of V2 tried to avoid an impact by steering right. The left front-end of the case vehicle struck the left front-end of V2. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise back into the northbound lane where it came to rest facing southeast. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing north-northeast. The 60-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle one. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel and side curtain air bags deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside facility and later transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant. The 38-year-old female driver of V2 was the only occupant of the of the passenger car. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She sustained critical injuries and was transported by air to a level-one trauma center, but was dead on arrival.
