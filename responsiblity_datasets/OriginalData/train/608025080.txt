The case vehicle, a 1998 4-door Chevrolet Cavalier sedan was eastbound a straight section of a dry, asphalt two-lane roadway. It was dark and foggy. Vehicle two (V2) a 1998 Kenworth tractor-trailer, was westbound on the same roadway. The driver of V2 saw the case vehicle cross the center line as the two vehicles closed and attempted to avoid a collision by moving as far to the right as possible in his lane an onto the paved shoulder . The case vehicle did not alter its path of travel and struck the left side of the front duel wheels of the tractor. The impact rotated the case vehicle counterclockwise before it was struck on the right fender by the front duel wheels of the trailer. The case vehicle continued to rotate and departed the road off of the south shoulder and came to rest on the road side facing east-northeast. The impact of the case vehicle with the trailer wheels of V2 caused the trailer to shift onto the north shoulder. As the driver of V2 attempted to regain control of the rig by steering left, the trailer began to fish-tail. V2 crossed the center line, entered the eastbound lane and briefly traversed the gravel shoulder before re-entering the trafficway as V2 slowed. The driver regained control of the unit and brought it to a stop in the westbound lane at the entrance to a gentle right- sweeping curve. The case occupant, the 20-year-old male driver was unrestrained, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The 19-year-old male right-front passenger was wearing a three-point belt and the top instrument panel air bag deployed. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with severe injuries. The right-front passenger was transported to local hospital with police reported 'C' injuries.
