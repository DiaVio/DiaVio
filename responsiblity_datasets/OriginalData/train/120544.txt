The case occupant is the 165 cm, 50 kg (5 ft 5 in, 110 lb), 14-year-old female passenger of a 2004 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan. The case vehicle was struck in the right-side by the front of a 2005 Dodge Durango, 4-door utility vehicle when the Saturn driver lost control, and the Saturn entered a counter clockwise rotation crossing the centerline of a two-lane road. The impact was classified as severe. The WinSMASH reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 52 kmph (32 mph), which appeared to be consistent with the observed vehicle damage. The case occupant was using the available three-point seat belt. The right side-curtain air bag deployed. In response to the 3 o'clock direction of force (80 degrees), she moved to her right, relative to the vehicle interior. She sustained several right-sided facial lacerations, abrasions, and contusions, a right orbital blowout fracture, bilateral maxillary sinus fractures, a left frontal lobe contusion, diffuse axonal injury, a left fronto-parietal subdural hematoma, and a loss of consciousness with neurological deficit probably from contact with the hood of the striking vehicle through the curtain air bag. She also sustained a right pulmonary contusion from contact with the door and a spleen laceration from contact with the center console. She died as a result of her injuries.
