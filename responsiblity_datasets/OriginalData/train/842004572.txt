This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 23 year old male driver of a 2002 Honda LX 2-door coupe. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2001 Nissan Altima GXE 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). This investigation also focused on the injury mechanisms of the restrained 32 year old female driver of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 2 was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of the collision. Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a right curve. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the same roadway and had previously exited a right curve into the straightaway. It was dark (street not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 exited the curve and continued across the centerline, into the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 entered the eastbound travel lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest (in a private yard) off the north pavement edge facing southeast. Vehicle 2 came to rest off the south pavement edge facing northeast. Following the crash, both drivers were transported to a local trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
