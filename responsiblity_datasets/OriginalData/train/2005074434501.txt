This one-vehicle right side roadway departure collision occurred on a -5% sloped concrete, two-way, 4-lane, left curving, and lighted roadway. It was early evening and dark, but lighted. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Honda Civic sedan with one occupant, a 37 year old male. V1 was traveling west in lane one. When V1 arrived at a point in the roadway where it started curving left when the driver's cell phone rang. The driver reached for phone that was attached to the driver's belt on right side, with right-hand and steered the vehicle with his left-hand. At the same time, the driver diverted his sight/attention to the act of removing phone and failed to maintain V1 within the traffic lane and roadway. As a result, the vehicle traveled partially on road and partially on a sidewalk. Upon the driver feeling the road departure, he looked up and had no time to avoid a collision with a non-breakaway streetlight pole 19 meters (62 feet) after the roadway departure. The front right corner struck the streetlight before the vehicle rotated clockwise 45 degrees as it came to final rest facing north. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: internal distraction.
