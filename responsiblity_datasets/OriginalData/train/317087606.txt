This case involved a 33 year old restrained male driver of a 2008 GMC Canyon regular cab, 4x2, pickup truck (V1). The driver was restrained by the manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. There were no side impact airbags available in this vehicle. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 1999 Hino single unit box type truck (V2). The crash occurred at night on a well lit divided interstate highway. The dry asphalt roadway was straight with a 3% downhill grade and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 105 kph (65 mph). V1 and V2 were traveling in the second of four southbound lanes with V1 behind V2. V2's speed was estimated to be 97 kmph (60 mph) at the time of the crash. According to information downloaded from the event data recorder, V1 was traveling at 150 kph (93 mph) when it struck the back of V2. V1 underrode the rear of V2 and was dragged approximately 150 meters. Both vehicles traveled off the right side of the roadway to final rest on the grass roadside. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V2 was not disabled and was driven from the crash scene. The driver of V1 was initially transported to a local hospital then later transferred to a level one trauma center due to serious injuries sustained in the crash.
