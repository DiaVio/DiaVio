Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 38-year old, male driver, of a 2005 Nissan Frontier pick-up truck, which was involved in a frontal impact with the rear plane of a 1997 Ford F-250 pick-up truck. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the early evening hours (dark), of a winter weekday, on an east/west, two-lane roadway. This roadway is straight and has a positive grade for the westbound travel direction. The speed limit is 45 mph (72 km/h). At time of the crash, it was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle 1, the 2005 Nissan Frontier pick-up truck, was being operated by the 38-year old male driver (case occupant), in the westbound travel lane. He intended to continue traveling west. He was not utilizing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags. Vehicle 2, a 1997 Ford F-250 pick-up truck, was stopped in the westbound travel lane, heading west. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to turn left into the entrance of a private driveway. Crash: Vehicle 1 was traveling west, approaching the rear plane of Vehicle 2. Unfortunately, the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck and partially under rode the rear plane of Vehicle 2 in a rear-end type impact. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway (possible post crash movement based upon fluid spill locations), facing unknown directions. As a result of the impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
