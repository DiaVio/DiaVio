Vehicle one (V1), a dark gray 2003 Ford F250 4WD pickup truck, was northbound in lane one. V1 did not stop for vehicle two, stopped at a red light and the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. V1 then entered lane two and the intersection. V3 had entered the intersection eastbound and had turned left and the front of V1 impacted the back right corner of V3. After the impact, with V3, V1 came to final rest in the number two lane facing generally north. V1 was towed due to damage. The restrained V1 driver, a 63-year-old male, was transported and admitted to a local hospital. There was no interview with this driver; so all known factor information is derived from the police report, medical records, vehicle inspection, crash dynamics and observations from other drivers. The police report indicated the V1 driver was speeding, and estimated the speed of V1 to be 97 kmph (60 mph) in the 64 kmph (40 mph) speed limit zone. The police report indicated alcohol was not involved for the V1 driver; however, a medical condition was being investigated as a contributing factor for this driver. Paramedics at the scene found the driver to be confused and measured the drivers' glucose level at 30, which was well below the normal range. Paramedics then administered an amp D50 and his glucose level came back up to 150 and his mental status improved. Medical records indicate the driver was currently taking the following medications: cialis, insulin, lisinopril, flexoril, hydrochlorothiazide, vytorin, aspirin, metoprolol and digoxin. The medical records indicate the driver stated he had breakfast at 0730 hours and had taken his regular dose of insulin. The driver said he forgot to eat lunch because he was preoccupied thinking about a medical appointment he was on his way to when the crash occurred. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was: other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to driver one as a critical non-performance error: heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act.
