The crash occurred on the right roadside off the eastbound lanes of a four-lane rural highway with a guardrail protected grass median. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65 mph) and a 3% uphill grade. Conditions were daylight and dry with cloudy skies. The crash occurred in the mid-afternoon hours on a weekday.

Vehicle one was a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta sedan that was traveling east in lane one. There was a large garbage can in V1's lane of travel and the driver steered sharply left. She then overcompensated to the right and her vehicle rotated clockwise 120 degrees. The vehicle traveled off the roadway on the right side and into a group of small trees striking the same with its left plane. The vehicle then rotated clockwise another 180 degrees after deflecting off a tree, striking another tree with its right plane before coming to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

A 25-year old female drove the Volkswagen Jetta and had no passengers. The driver was checked at the scene by EMS with possible injuries. She stated that she noticed the garbage can at the last second and lost control attempting to avoid it. She estimated her travel speed to be 109 kmph (68 mph) prior to the avoidance maneuver. V1 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Pre-crash Event was off the edge of the road on the right; the Critical Reason for Critical Pre-crash Event was a performance error, failure to control the vehicle with skill ordinarily expected. Associative factors include a failure to look far enough ahead, an unknown level of inattention, insufficient steering/braking actions, and a travel flow interruption (the garbage can in the roadway.)
