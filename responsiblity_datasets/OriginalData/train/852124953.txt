This crash occurred on a two lane, two way highway at dawn with clear dry conditions. Case Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Dodge Neon four door sedan was eastbound and drifted off the roadway into the ditch. V1 then banked the left side tires up on the south side of the ditch just before the undercarriage and front left tire impacted the culvert and the edge of a paved driveway. The left tire came completely off V1 after it impacted into the cowl and lower left sill of V1. This impact to the left tire and undercarriage then caused the left side of V1 to lift upward and V1 then began to roll over to the right six quarter turns before the left side of VI impacted a tree and stopped V1. V1 then roll back slightly and came to final rest on its roof near the tree. V1 was damage and had to be towed. The driver is the case occupant and no other passengers were in V1. This driver was a 49 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal air bag deployed on the impact into the driveway edge and culvert. The case driver had serious injuries and was transported the trauma center.
