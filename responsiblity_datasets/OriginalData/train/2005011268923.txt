The crash occurred in the intersection of a north/south roadway and a driveway from a retail area on the west side of the road. The conditions at the time of the weekday morning crash were clear and dry on the bituminous two-way roads.

V1, a 1996 Dodge Neon, driven by a 21 year-old female, was traveling east out of the driveway to go north onto the roadway. V1 was stopped in the left turn lane of the three-lane driveway and the driver pulled out across the path of v2 to turn left into the opposite direction of travel of v2. The driver stated that she might have glanced left briefly, but possibly not, and then looked right to wait for traffic to clear prior to pulling out of the driveway. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V2, a 1997 Ford E-150 cargo work van driven by a 50 year-old female, was traveling south on the two-lane road. A second southbound lane began prior to the driveway, in addition to a left turn lane for northbound traffic, but v2 continued in the left lane to go straight on the roadway. The driver of v2 saw the Neon proceed across the lane in front of her and braked, with lock-up, and steered left. The front of v2 struck the left front and passenger side of v1 partially in the left turn lane. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage.
