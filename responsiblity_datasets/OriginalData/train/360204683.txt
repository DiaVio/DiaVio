This case occupant is a 58 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a minor frontal crash with no air bag deployments. He sustained serious injuries, was transported to an outside hospital and was later transferred to the trauma center. This crash occurred during the late afternoon hours, in darkness with overhead street lights in lane two of three, on the one way southbound lanes of a divided interstate freeway. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry, level asphalt travel lanes. There are paved shoulders on both sides and lane three is a restricted/carpool lane. Vehicle one (V1), 2010 Dodge Avenger R/T four door sedan, was traveling south in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Dodge Caravan minivan, was traveling south in lane two, just ahead of V1. Traffic volumes were heavy and the vehicles traveling ahead of V1 were decelerating. V1 began to slow but the front of V1 impacted the back of V2, resulting in minor damage. V1 and V2 traveled a short distance south and came to final rest, still in lane two, facing south. Neither vehicle was towed from the scene. The case occupant in V1 is a 58 year old male driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and no air bags deployed. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and was later transferred to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
