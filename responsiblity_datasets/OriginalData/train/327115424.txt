This case involves an impact between a tree and the left side of a passenger car. The unrestrained 19-year-old female driver and the restrained 21-year-old female right-front passenger are the case occupants. The case vehicle, a 2004 four-door Volkswagen Jetta, was southbound on a wet, level, two-lane concrete road. It was dark, but lighted and raining. The driver lost control of the case vehicle, it entered a clockwise yaw, traversed the mouth of a private drive then struck a large tree with its left side. The impact was located behind the B-pillar and came to rest facing northwest. Toward the end of the event, bowing of the vehicle body caused the door striker to release from the post and the case occupant fell out of the vehicle on to the ground. The unrestrained 19-year-old female driver and the restrained 21-year-old female right-front passenger are the case occupants. The driver frontal-impact air bag did not deploy, but the left roof side-rail and seat back air bags deployed. The passengerâ€™s top-instrument panel mounted, frontal-impact air bag deployed, but the right roof side-rail and seat back air bags did not deploy. In addition, there was an unrestrained 20-year-old male left-rear passenger. All three vehicle occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center. The driver and the right-front passenger were consented as case occupants. The left-rear passenger was not consented, but the public record police report listed a left arm, bilateral femur, left lower-leg and pelvis fractures. In addition, he sustained an unspecified C-spine injury.
