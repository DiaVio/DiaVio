This case involves a frontal impact event resulting in head and extremity injuries to the driver of case vehicle. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Ford Focus 4-door hatchback, was traveling west on a three-lane highway and was exiting an off ramp to the right. A concrete barrier runs along the left outer embankment of the exit lanes. It was daylight hours, the weather was clear and the concrete road was dry and level. The posted speed limit on the roadway is 89 km/h (55 mph) with 40 km/h (25 mph) exit. The crash occurred when exiting the highway off ramp with a curve to the right. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise and departed lane to the left, and the front of V1 impacted the concrete barrier bounding the outer embankment. V1 came to rest facing south after spinning 180 degrees and its back right corner impacted the same concrete barrier. The 32-year old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was unrestrained and sustained head and extremity injuries. He was transported via ground transportation to nearby hospital and later admitted to the medical/surgical unit.
