Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Hyundai Elantra sedan, was traveling north in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, dark conditions negotiating a curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Honda Accord sedan, was traveling south in lane one of the same roadway, negotiating a curve to the right. V1 attempted to pass another vehicle and changed lanes to the left, into lane two. At this point the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 came to final rest facing north in the northbound lane and V2 came to rest facing south in the southbound. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 40-year-old male, was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. No airbags deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
