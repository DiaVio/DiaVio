This case involves a 83-year-old female in a frontal collision in a 2005 Chrysler Sebring. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Chrysler Sebring convertible, was traveling east in lane one of a three lane, one-way leg of a highway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Toyota 4Runner utility vehicle, was also traveling east in lane one of the same roadway, directly in front of V1. V2 slowed for stopped traffic and the front of V1 contacted the back of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway and both were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 (case study occupant), an 83 year-old female, was properly wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and had her frontal airbag deploy. V1's right front passenger, an 87-year-old male, was also wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and had his frontal airbag deploy. Both occupants in V1 were transported to a level one trauma center for treatment.
