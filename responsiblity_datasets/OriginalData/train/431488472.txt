This case involves an 87-year-old female case occupant 145 cms (4'9") tall and weighing 46 kilograms (101 pounds). The case occupant was the front right passenger of a 2007 Lexus ES350 sedan involved in a moderate severity near side crash with a 2002 Lincoln Continental sedan. The principal direction of force was 2 o'clock. She was properly restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The car was equipped with frontal instrument panel, roof side rail, seat back, and knee bolster air bags; the driver's steering wheel and lower instrument panel bags deployed as a result of the crash. The case occupant was sitting upright and moved out-board during the collision. This movement is supported by an indentation on the lower rear quadrant of the inner passenger side door. She sustained a cortex contusion, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral infarction, all of which were on the right. This was attributed to the occupant striking her head on the right window sill due to her short stature. She also had a right forehead and eyelid hematoma that supported this mechanism. However, there was no contact on the passenger side upper door panel. It is possible that the case occupant was partially ejected and her head contacted the hood of V2. During the collision, the patient also sustained right sacral ala and inferior/superior pubic rami fractures and popliteal vein laceration caused by the pelvic fractures. The contact was the lower rear quadrant of the door, which was coded as certain. C7 and T1 right transverse process fractures were attributed to probable flexion over the seat belt. She sustained a right rib fracture to the first rib from probable contact with the right reat upper quadrant of the door and a left hip contusion from probable contact with the seat belt.
