This case involves a minor impact between the right fender/bumper corner of a compact pick-up truck and the front of a passenger car, which resulted in the pick-up-truck striking the front of a tractor/trailer unit. The case vehicle, a 2008 Dodge Dakota compact pick-up truck was travelling in the eastbound through lane of a dry, level, asphalt four-lane traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and clear. Vehicle two (V2), a 2011 Toyota Camry was in the northbound through lane of the intersecting road. Vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Kenworth T-600 tractor/trailer unit was stopped in traffic in the westbound left-turn lane. As the case vehicle was crossing through the intersection, it crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right fender/bumper corner of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and strike the front of V3 with its front end. The restrained 39-year-old male driver and the unrestrained 54-year-old male right-front passenger/case occupant were the only occupants of the case vehicle. Each had the benefit of deployed frontal impact air bags. The police reported that the driver possibly sustained multiple moderate injuries. The case occupant sustained moderate injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
