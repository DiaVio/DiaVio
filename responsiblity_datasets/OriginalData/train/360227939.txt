This single vehicle rollover crash involved a 48 year old female who was the front right passenger using a lap/shoulder seatbelt and sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle rollover crash occurred through a right curve on a two lane, two lane road with clear, dry, and dark conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan Altima four door sedan was eastbound on this roadway and approached this curve to the right at a high rate of speed. V1 lost control and began to rotate clockwise as it departed the roadway to the left in the curve. V1 then began to slide laterally down a shallow slope from the roadway and as the tires dug into the soft sandy ground, V1's left side impacted a sign post, shearing it from its base and resulting in minor vehicle damage. V1 then tripped and rolled over to the left eight quarter turns and came to final rest facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 48 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belts. The retractor pretensioners fired and the frontal instrumental panel airbag deployed during the rollover. She was transported to a local hospital with serious injuries and then transferred to the trauma center. The male driver (unknown age) was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the retractor pretensioners fired and the steering column airbag deployed. He was transported and released at a local hospital with minor injuries.
