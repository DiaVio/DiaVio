This case involves a corner impact between the front of a passenger car and a utility pole that resulted in a four-quarter turn rollover. The case vehicle, a 2010 four-door Nissan Versa, was northbound on a dry ,two-lane, asphalt, road approaching a three-leg intersection. It was daylight and clear. The vehicle drifted right into the parking lane, mounted the curb. While straddling the roadside and parking lane, it struck a small sign post, then struck a utility pole with its right-front corner, entered a clockwise rotation, rolled over left-side leading four-quarter turns and came to rest in the northbound travel lane on its wheels facing east. The unrestrained 54-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
