This single-vehicle crash occurred on a jersey barrier-divided, straight, level trafficway. The eastbound roadway consists of five through lanes with a wide shoulder on the right (south) side and a narrow shoulder on the left (north) side. The speed limit on this roadway is 105 kmph (65 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 BMW 525I, was eastbound in lane five, traveling at more than 113 kmph (70 mph). V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway and the left side struck the median jersey barrier. V1 traveled across all five lanes and came to final rest on the right shoulder. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a forty-two-year-old female, was traveling from her home to work. She was healthy, well rested and comfortable with her vehicle. She travels this route daily. This driver stated that a mosquito was in her vehicle and she swatted at it with her right hand. In the process, she inadvertently turned the steering wheel to the left.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the left side." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; internal distraction." This driver's speed and poor directional control (e.g. failure to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected) were associated factors.
