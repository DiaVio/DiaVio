This crash occurred in the early afternoon in the center median of a four-lane divided highway. The north/south highway consisted two lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median and guardrail. The concrete highway was dry, level, curved to the right and featured a posted speed limit of 112kmph (70mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier (two door) with three occupants, was northbound in lane one negotiating the curve right. A non-contact vehicle in lane two began cutting into lane one. V1 accelerated in an attempt to avoid this vehicle and lost control as it steered left. V1 departed the roadway to the left and contacted the center guardrail. V1 bounced off the guardrail and continued rotating counter-clockwise before rolling right two quarter-turns and coming to final rest in the median on it's roof. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a 20-year old female, and her two passengers reported minor injuries and were transported to a trauma facility. She stated that she was traveling home from picking up her check from work and traveling between 98-112kmph (61-70 mph). She saw another vehicle cutting into her lane but was afraid to slow down, as there was vehicle directly behind her. She accelerated to avoid the other vehicle and than steered left but overcompensated and lost control of the vehicle. She departed the roadway and struck the guardrail.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a driver related factor, an incorrect evasive action. This was chosen since the vehicle's acceleration and subsequent steering maneuvers caused it to lose control. Associated factors include overcompensation and the fact she was an inexperienced driver.
