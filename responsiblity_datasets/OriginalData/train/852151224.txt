This case occupant was a 69 year old male who was in a near-side impact collision, restrained with a lap/shoulder belt with a seatback side impact airbag deployment, and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with dry, overcast conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Focus 2 door sedan traveling westbound on a two lane, two way roadway and had slowed down to make a left turn into a driveway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1990 Subaru Legacy wagon, was traveling westbound behind V1 and started to pass V1 in the opposite westbound lane. As V1 began to make the left turn, V2 locked up the brakes leaving skid marks in the westbound lane before the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V2 pushed V1 to the southwest off the south edge of the road. V1 went down into ditch and came to final rest facing southwest. V2 also departed the roadway and came to final rest facing southwest near V1. V1 was towed due to damage and V2 was driven away. The case occupant, a 69 year old male, was restrained with a lap/shoulder belt and the seatback side impact air bag deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
