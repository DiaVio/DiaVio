This moderate severity head-on frontal crash involved a 50 year female who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt with pretensioners and a frontal airbag deployment. She sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with dry and overcast conditions on a two lane, two way roadway with paved shoulders. Vehicle one (V1), a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta wagon was westbound and vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Subaru Outback wagon was eastbound. V1 departed its lane to the left and traveled into the eastbound lane. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2. V1 rotated counterclockwise while traveling in a northwesterly direction across the centerline and back into the westbound lane, where it came to final rest facing southeast. V2 also rotated counterclockwise, traveled over the south paved shoulder and departed the roadway near the point of impact. V2 came to final rest facing northwest with its front tires partially on the shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 50 year old female, is the case occupant. She was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt and her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and the front steering column mounted airbag deployed. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center.
