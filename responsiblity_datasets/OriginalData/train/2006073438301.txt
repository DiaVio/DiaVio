This single-vehicle crash occurred at the crest of a controlled-access roadway interchange area. A jersey barrier divides the north/south roadway and the southbound lanes consist of two through lanes with a rumble strip on the right side next to the paved shoulder. The crash occurred at dawn and it was raining at the time. The roadway is straight and level at this location and was wet at the time of the crash. The speed limit at the location of the crash is 80 kmph (50 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chevrolet Malibu, was southbound in lane one. V1 slid on the wet roadway and departed the right side of the road, rotating counterclockwise. V1 traveled down an embankment and rolled over to the right four quarter-turns. V1 came to rest on its wheels in a drainage ditch facing east and was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a twenty-one-year-old female, was on her way home after working a night shift. She was very familiar with her route and her vehicle, but admitted to feeling fatigued when she left her place of employment. She also admitted that she was driving over the speed limit at the time of the crash.

The pre-event movement for V1 was coded as "going straight." The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to: traveling too fast for conditions." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor - too fast for conditions (too fast for the rain slick roadway)." Poor tread condition and possible under-inflation of the tires may have been a contributing factor for this crash.
