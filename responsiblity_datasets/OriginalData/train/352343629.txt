Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 17-year old, male driver, of a 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt 2-door coupe, which was involved in a frontal impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight), of a late winter weekday, on a curved and graded two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally north and south and has a right turning downhill graded curve for the southbound travel direction. The roadway has a speed limit of 40 mph (64 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The overall environment is rural with a heavy concentration of wooded areas bordering either side of the road. Vehicle 1, the 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt 2-door coupe, was being operated by the 17-year old male driver (case occupant), in the southbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the right turning curve, it drifted left and crossed over the northbound lane and departed the roadway at the east side. Vehicle 1 subsequently struck a guardrail with its left side plane and then a tree (46 cm in diameter) with its frontal plane before coming to rest. As a result of the frontal impact, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was removed from the vehicle and transported, by air unit, to a regional trauma center and hospital with minor to moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
