This case involved the 20 year old female right front passenger of a 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt 4-door sedan (V1). She was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt and there was also deployment of the right roof side rail head curtain. The driver of V1 was a 31 year old unrestrained male with no deployed airbags. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 2000 Ford F-150 Super cab pickup truck pulling a large utility trailer (V2). The crash occurred at a four-leg intersection during daylight hours. The roadway was asphalt with a level grade. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash as the road was dry. The north/south sections of the intersection were controlled by a yellow flashing light and the east/west sections were controlled by a flashing red light and stop signs. V1 was traveling west approaching the four-leg intersection. V1 stopped at the intersection, and then proceeded across to continue traveling west. As V1 passed through the intersection, it was contacted in the right side by the front of V2, who was traveling south on the intersecting roadway. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and depart the southwest side of the roadway. V1 impacted a small wooden post with its left side before coming to rest. V2 came to rest forward of impact area on the south side of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The right front passenger of V1 (case subject) was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center where she was hospitalized for treatment of her serious injuries. The driver of V1 was uninjured and received no medical treatment.
