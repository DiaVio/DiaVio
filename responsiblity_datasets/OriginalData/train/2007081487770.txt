This single-vehicle crash occurred a couple hours past noon during daylight hours. The location was a rural residential roadway. The roadway was a level, straight, two-way, two-lane, bituminous roadway. The weather was clear and cloudy, but the roadway was icy. The posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Mustang 2-door coupe, had just turned left from a separate roadway to travel eastbound on this icy roadway. V1 lost control immediately after turning onto this roadway, and never regained control. The vehicle fishtailed then rotated counter clockwise and departed the roadway to the left with the passenger side leading. V1 impacted a mailbox with the right side door area. The impact caused V1 to roll 2 quarter turns to the right, coming to rest on the roof. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

Most factors for this driver are unknown as the driver left the scene after the crash & there were no witnesses.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: too fast for conditions (specified as: roadway icy and the left rear tire had no tread). Poor directional control was an associative factor for this driver. Both right side tires were under-inflated and the left rear tire had no tread left.
