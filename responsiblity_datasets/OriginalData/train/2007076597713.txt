This single-vehicle crash occurred on a straight, undivided, two-lane roadway. This roadway has an uphill grade in the eastbound direction. The speed limit on this roadway is 89 kmph (55 mph). It was dark at the time of the crash with no adverse atmospheric conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 GMC Yukon, was eastbound in lane one. The front of V1 struck an elk that was in lane one. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of V1, a forty-seven-year-old male, was on his way from a restaurant in a nearby town to go camping with his seven-year-old son. This driver was well rested, healthy and comfortable with his vehicle and passenger. He drives this route rarely. This driver stated that he saw the sign indicating, "watch for animals" and was aware that caution was required on this roadway.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: animal in roadway. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for conditions (dark roadway/warning sign for animals on roadway). The driver was aware he needed to reduce his speed but failed to do so. Also, inadequate surveillance was an associated factor. The driver stated that he was looking straight ahead prior to the crash, but he did not see the animal in time to avoid it even with full ABS application.
