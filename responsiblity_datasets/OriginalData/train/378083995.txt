This crash occurred in a 4-legged intersection. V1 is a 2004 Jeep Wrangler Limited traveling on a surface street which is situated in a north to south configuration and is comprised of a divided trafficway with a raised median without a positive barrier. V2 is a 1989 Ford Ranger Super Cab pickup traveling in the exit ramp for the limited access trafficway. It is a one way trafficway comprised of four travel lanes. It is situated in a southeast to northwest configuration. The intersection is controlled by a traffic light. The roadway on which V1 was traveling is comprised of two travel lanes. At the time of the crash it was daylight, the weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Traffic for that time of the day can be moderate to heavy. V1 was equipped with 3-point lap and shoulder restraints for each seating position. In addition to the manual restraints V1 is also equipped with a driver and right passenger frontal impact air bags, both of which deployed in the crash. V1 was traveling in a northerly direction in the second lane. V2 was traveling in a southeasterly direction in the through lane. As V1 was traveling through the intersection it was struck in the left side by the front of V2. After the initial impact V1 started to rotate in a clockwise direction as V2 was rotating in a counterclockwise direction. The left of V1 and the right of V2 made contact in a sideslap type impact. After the second impact V1 and V2 separated and rolled to their final rest positions. The restrained 31 year old male driver of V1 did not lose consciousness in the crash. He was awake when the paramedics arrived. Due to the front doors of the vehicle being jammed shut the driver had to be extricated from the vehicle. He was removed and transported to the trauma center via helicopter.
