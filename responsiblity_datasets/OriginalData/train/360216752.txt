This near-side impact crash involves an 87 year-old male driver who was wearing a manual lap and shoulder belt with buckle pretensioner actuation and deployment of the frontal steering column-mounted and knee bolster-mounted air bags. He sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours on a four-lane, two-way roadway. The east-west roadway consists of two eastbound, one westbound and one center left turn only lane which are straight, level and comprised of asphalt. There are business driveways located on the north side of the roadway. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Dodge Caravan minivan, was on the north side of the roadway, turning left out of a driveway, intending to travel east. Vehicle two (V2), a 1988 GMC C1500 large pickup truck, was traveling west in lane one. As V1 entered V2's lane of travel, the driver of V2 braked and steered left, but the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal and knee air bags. After the impact, V1 traveled a short distance west while rotating clockwise, and came to final rest facing northwest in the center left turn only lane. V2 traveled across the eastbound travel lanes and off the south side of the roadway, where it came to final rest, facing south. V1 and V2 sustained disabling damage and were towed from the scene. The case occupant is the 87 year-old male driver of V1, who was wearing a manual lap and shoulder belt with a buckle pretensioner actuating on impact. This case occupant's steering column-mounted frontal air bag and lower left instrument panel-mounted knee air bag deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was taken to an outside hospital before being transferred to the trauma center.
