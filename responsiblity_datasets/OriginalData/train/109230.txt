Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Lincoln Town Car, 4-door sedan was traveling west on a one-way westbound exit ramp and was entering a freeway rest area. It was daylight, the skies were cloudy, and the bituminuous road was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly confused the gas and brake pedals and accelerated when he meant to brake. V1 departed the right side of the exit ramp, crossed a mowed lawn area, and the left-front wheel/tire sideswiped a large tree. V1 continued in a northwest direction and the left-rear quarter panel of V1 sideswiped a well head/pump. V1 continued in a northwest direction, began a slight counterclockwise yaw and the front of V1 struck and uprooted a large conifer tree. V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 30 degrees and came to rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 79-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 79-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted and seat backrest-mounted airbags deployed. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and both later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
