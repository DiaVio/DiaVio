This single vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane asphalt roadway. The southbound lane curves left and is slightly uphill, then straightens out and is slightly downhill. The speed limit for the area is 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred at night with no street lights present.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Plymouth Neon 2-door sedan, was driven by a twenty one year old male with one passenger. V1 was southbound when it crossed the double yellow center line to the left as it was negotiating the left curve. It returned to the southbound lane and began to rotate clockwise as it departed the right road edge. V1 impacted a bush and a large rock with its front-end plane as it continued to rotate clockwise. V1 then rolled left one-quarter turn and slid to its final rest on its left side on the southbound dirt shoulder facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

The driver was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs as witnessed on scene by the researcher. The officer on scene estimated the speed of V1 was 96 kmph (60 mph). The passenger was transported due to injury. The vehicle inspection showed that the tires had sufficient tread depth but were all under inflated.
