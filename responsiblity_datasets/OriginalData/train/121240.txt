Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 GMC Sierra, extended cab pickup truck was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a four-lane, two-way municipal road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 intended to slow his vehicle by braking but confused the accelerator and brake pedals. V1 accelerated and the driver steered left, crossed the southbound lanes and departed the left side of the road. V1 climbed a grassy embankment, came down the back side into a paved parking lot and the undercarriage of V1 struck the pavement as evidenced by gouges in the pavement. V1 continued in a north-westerly direction, traversed the parking lot and the front of V1 struck the corner of a building in an offset-frontal configuration. V1 rotated slightly counter clockwise and the front of V1 struck and penetrated a wooden fence before coming to final rest facing west. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 72-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital where he was treated and released with seat belt contusions (ISS-1). The 85-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center and later transferred to another regional level-one trauma center.
