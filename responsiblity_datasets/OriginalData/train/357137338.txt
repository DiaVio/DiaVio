This case involves a small-overlap impact to the right side of the front-end of a passenger car and a tree as the primary impact. The 58-year-old male driver is the case occupant. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2009 four-door Volkswagen CC, was travelling in the northbound lane of a dry, level, two-lane, asphalt road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 two-door Scion TC hatchback, was southbound on the same road. The driver of the case vehicle was experiencing a hypoglycemic episode when the case vehicle crossed the centerline. The driver of V2 tried to avoid an impact by steering right onto the shoulder. The left fender and wheel of the case vehicle sideswiped the left side of V2. The impact re-directed the case vehicle back across the center line and the case vehicle departed the road off the east shoulder, entered a shallow drainage ditch, crossed a private drive and struck a tree with its front-right corner. The case vehicle rotated clockwise around the tree and came to rest facing east. It was dark, but not lighted and clear. The 58-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He sustained multiple moderate injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
