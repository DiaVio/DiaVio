Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Acura, 3.2 TL, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the left inside lane of a six lane, limited access freeway (three lanes east bound, protected median, three lanes westbound) and was approaching an interchange area. The driver of V1 drifted off the left side of the road onto the shoulder and while attempting to steer to the right to re-enter the travel lane, she lost control crossing all three westbound lanes. V1 departed the right side of the road and the front of V1 struck the earthen embankment. V1 climbed the embankment, struck a bush with the right fender, and made an arcing left turn across the top of the embankment. V1 traveled down the embankment and the undercarriage of V1 struck the ground at the bottom of the embankment. V1 came to rest off the right shoulder facing west-southwest. V1 was towed due disabling vehicle damage. The 81-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. The 86-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was also transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
