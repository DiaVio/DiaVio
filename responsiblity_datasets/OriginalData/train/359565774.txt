This moderate severity frontal crash involved a 28 year old female driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This frontal crash occurred during daylight hours in the four one-way lanes of a divided freeway at an interchange area. Lane one was a merging lane and lanes two to four were through lanes. A paved shoulder and a concrete barrier bordered the north side of the lanes. It was raining and the roadway was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Ford Focus two door hatchback, was traveling eastbound in lane three. The driver of V1 lost control on the wet surface and began to fishtail. V1 entered lane two and then veered back across lanes three and four before departing the roadway to the left. The front of V1 then impacted the concrete barrier bordering the north side of the lanes. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and the back right corner impacted the concrete barrier. V1 continued to rotate and came to final rest facing southeast in lane four. V1 was damaged and disabled. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and only person in the vehicle. She is a 28 year old female and was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. The retractor pretensioner actuated and the frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed on impact. She was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center. She was hospitalized for serious injuries sustained in the crash.
