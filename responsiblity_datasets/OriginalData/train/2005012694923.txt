He reported that he was in good health, and wore glasses for a hyperopic (far-sighted) condition and was wearing them at the time of the crash. This driver also stated that he is a heavy-footed driver and that he had passed the occupant's home. He looked over at the occupant when the occupant was telling him to go down the street to turn around and come back to his house.

Post-crash investigation revealed the van's odometer to be locked at 53 mph. Both the driver and passenger were transported to a hospital for injuries sustained in the crash. The van was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.
