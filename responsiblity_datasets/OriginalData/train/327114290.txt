This case involves a narrow left front fender impacting a tree (equivalent to a small over-lap impact). The unrestrained 24-year-old male driver is the case occupant. Neither of the available frontal-impact airbags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2001Chevrolet Blazer 4x4, was northbound on a dry, asphalt, two-lane road with a 2% positive upgrade. The driver lost control of the case vehicle and it crossed the center line. It then departed the road off the west shoulder and struck a tree on the roadside. It was dark and cloudy. After impact, the case vehicle rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest facing north-northeast. The 24-year-old male driver was not restrained by a three-point belt and was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside facility and then transferred to level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
