The crash occurred in the southbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. There was one northbound and one southbound lane. This was a curvy, 7% uphill grade, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 KMPH (35 MPH). It was early afternoon on a weekend and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was light.

V1, a 2004 Dodge Stratus, was driven by a 20 year-old male who reported no injuries. He advised he was returning home from a friends house, traveling uphill at a higher than posted speed. He lost control around a right curve, departed his lane, steered right to get back into his lane and then steered left to "straighten it out". Upon doing so, the vehicle lost control skidding in a counterclockwise direction striking a hillside with the front end. The vehicle continued to rotate counterclockwise and struck the rear end into the hillside. The vehicle came to rest perfectly facing downhill in the southbound lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The Critical Pre crash Event was this vehicle traveling off the left side of the road. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre crash Event was driver related, too fast for the curve or turn. The driver drove this road on a weekly basis and knew that this turn was coming and should have slowed the vehicle to the posted speed. However after researching the roadway, the road was found to not meet AASHTO specifications. The curve is too sharp for the posted speed and should be lowered to 32KMPH (20MPH) to comply with the AASHTO specification.
