This case involves a severe rear impact event resulting in serious injuries to the right front passenger (case occupant). The crash occurred during night hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred without any intersection or traffic control device involvement on a one-way three-lane bituminous roadway which curves right at the crash location. The roadway is level and separated by dashed white lines. The roadway is part of a two-way twelve-lane trafficway divided into three-lane roadways by grass medians. Vehicle 1 (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 two-door Mitsubishi Eclipse coupe, was being driven northbound in the center lane. The crash occurred when a non-contact vehicle moved into V1's travel lane and the driver of V1 moved to the left lane to avoid contact. V1 crossed over the left lane and impacted the curb with the left front wheel. This initiated a counterclockwise rotation and V1, facing south, continued to travel north into the median. As it rotated the right front wheel impacted the curb followed by right rear wheel impacting the curb. V1 continued moving backward and the rear plane of V1 impacted a tree. V1 came to final rest on the grass median facing south. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by a 17 year old male restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The case occupant, a 14 year old male, was seated in the right front passenger seat and restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The driver and right front passenger were transported by ground transportation to a nearby hospital with minor and severe injuries, respectively. The case occupant was subsequently transferred to a trauma center.
