This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 50-year-old female belted driver of a 2011 Kia Soul with a deployed frontal airbag. This occupant sustained serious injuries in a frontal impact. The case vehicle was a five-door compact hatchback struck first on the front by an intermediate size sedan, resulting in moderate damage, followed by a minor front impact with a street sign. The crash occurred midevening in clear weather on a dry lighted road. A 2011 Kia Soul compact hatchback (Vehicle 1) was traveling south on a suburban bituminous six-lane, two-way road. The six lanes were separated by a raised concrete median. The grade for V1 was level as it approached an interstate interchange. A 1997 Honda Accord intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) was stopped facing east at the interchange with a 2% uphill grade. V1 continued south through the interchange as V2 began turning left. The front of V1 impacted the left front of V2 (Event 1). V2 rotated clockwise 70 degrees and came to rest near the point of impact. V1 continued through the interchange and onto a curbed grass median where it struck a street sign with its front (Event 2). V1 came to rest near the impact with the sign. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 50-year-old female case occupant. She was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed, while the available top instrument panel, curtain, and side seatback airbags did not deploy. This occupant initially went home from the scene before going to a local hospital. She was later transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
