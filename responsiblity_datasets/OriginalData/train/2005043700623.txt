The crash occurred in the westbound lanes of a four-lane interstate highway with a fenced, grass median. The roadway had a posted speed of 105kmph (65mph) and the southbound lanes had a downhill grade of 4%. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was late afternoon hours on a weekend.

V1 was a 2005 Jeep Liberty compact utility traveling westbound in lane one. Another vehicle in lane two reportedly merged into V1's lane, forcing it off the roadway. V1 traveled off the right roadside and into a small patch of trees, striking them with its front. V1 then climbed over the small tree, rolling one-quarter turn onto its right side. V1 came to final rest resting on the small tree, elevated slightly off of the ground. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

V1 was driven by a 31-year old female who was transported to a local hospital with possible injuries. She was unable to be located for an interview. This driver lives out of state, does not answer her phone, and did not return any calls. The investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 105kmph (65mph). The sport utility was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was other motor vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane (same direction) over the left lane line. The Critical Reason was coded as traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others. An associated factor was this vehicle traveling too fast and not realizing that caution was required. The driver of V1 was licensed out of state and driving a rental car. It is likely that she was not familiar with the roadway or the vehicle. No other associated factors could be coded to this driver in the absence of an interview.
