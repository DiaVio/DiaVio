Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Toyota Corolla sedan, was traveling west in lane two of a four lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. V1 was traveling uphill and was negotiating a curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Toyota Camry sedan, was traveling east in lane two of the same four lane, two-way roadway traveling downhill and negotiating a curve to the right. V2 attempted to pass another vehicle by crossing the double-yellow line when the front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. V1 came to final rest off the roadway to the north and V2 came to rest in the middle of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 43-year-old female and the case study occupant, was properly wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt. Both frontal airbags deployed in V1. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
