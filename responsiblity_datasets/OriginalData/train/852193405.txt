This frontal crash case involves a 63 year old female, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear skies and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Nissan Versa four door hatchback, was southbound on a two lane, two way asphalt roadway. In the area where the crash occurred, there is a bike lane adjacent to the southbound lane and a parking lane adjacent to the northbound lane. In V1's precrash area, the southbound lane is level and curves to the left. V1 was negotiating the left curve when the driver began to reach for an item to her right that was sliding off of her front right seat cushion. She was leaning to the right as the vehicle departed the roadway to the right, traveling up and over the curb. She appears to have leaned back to the left to be upright just before the front of V1 impacted a utility pole. The force of the impact caused the pole to tilt south (less than 45 degrees). V1 came to final rest against the pole, facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 63 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash and her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle, but the driver's 51 pound dog was riding in the second row seating area. The dog was separated from the front row by a plastic pet barrier and was not injured in the crash.
