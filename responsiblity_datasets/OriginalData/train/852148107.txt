The case occupant is a 52 year old female driver involved in a head-on frontal collision who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with frontal air bag deployment who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours with icy conditions on a two lane, two way level asphalt roadway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet Geo Tracker two door compact utility, was southbound on this roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Toyota 4x4 pickup truck, was northbound traveling opposite V1. Both vehicles were traveling on a straight section of the roadway and V1 began crossing a bridge/freeway overpass that was icy. V1 lost control on this bridge and began sliding into the oncoming travel lane after the bridge crossing. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2. Both vehicles rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest in the westbound lane, with V1 facing southeast and V2 facing northwest. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant, a 52 year old female, who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. The frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed on impact. This case driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
