Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 65-year old, female driver, of a 2011 Chevrolet HHR, which was involved in a moderate frontal impact with a utility pole. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during morning hours (daylight) of a spring weekday, on a four-lane, bituminous, roadway. This roadway runs generally east and west with one westbound travel lane, one westbound dedicated right turn lane, a dedicated, two-way, center left turn lane and one eastbound travel lane. The roadway is generally straight, with an uphill grade for the westbound travel direction. The speed limit is 35 mph (56 km/h) and at the time of the crash, there was a light drizzle of rain and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle 1, the 2011 Chevrolet HHR, was being operated by the 65-year old female driver (case occupant), in the westbound travel lane. She intended to continue traveling west. She was utilizing an available 3-point lap/shoulder belt (with retractor type pretensioner) and the vehicle was noted to be equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags and side rail curtains. Crash: As Vehicle 1 traveled west, it drifted right, off the right edge of the roadway and struck a utility pole with its frontal plane (event 1). Vehicle 1 pivoted slightly clockwise before coming to rest. As a result of this impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed and the driver's retractor pretensioner actuated. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was found in her respective seating area by the responding emergency medical services personnel (EMS). She was removed and transported, by land unit, to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
