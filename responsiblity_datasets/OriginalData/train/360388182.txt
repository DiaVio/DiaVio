The case occupant is an 81 year old male front row right side passenger who was involved in a head-on collision with another vehicle. This occupant was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment. He sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours, under rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of one east and one westbound asphalt travel lane. For eastbound vehicles, the travel lane has a slight uphill grade and curves to the left. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Acura TL four door sedan, was traveling east in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lane. As V2 entered the curved section of roadway, it departed its lane to the left and traveled into V1's lane of travel. V1's front impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's front row seat belt retractor pretensioners and the deployment of the frontal air bags. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest in the roadway, facing east. V2 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest on the roadway, facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 81 year old male front row right side passenger who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and his top instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There was a 79 year old female driver in the case vehicle. She was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt at the time of the crash. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her steering column mounted front air bag deployed. She sustained minor injuries and her treatment status is unknown.
