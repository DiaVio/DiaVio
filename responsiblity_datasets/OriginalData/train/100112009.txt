This case involves a belted driver responding to a frontal, off-set left, impact with a large tree and frontal impact air bag deployment. This single vehicle crash occurred on a five lane, undivided, street traveling through a residential area. The east/west, street had two lanes for travel in each direction with a continuous left turn lane separating them. There was a pronounced downhill grade from east to west and near the bottom of the hill the straight roadway gave way to a sweeping right curve. The roadway was bordered by curbs and sidewalks on both sides, and landscaping along the private properties. Specifically, there was a large pine tree on the south roadside where the curve began. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The case vehicle, a 1999 Mercedes Benz E320 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the number-two (left) lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, first row frontal impact air bags, seat back mounted side impacts air bags and left and right curtain air bags. The 78-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as evidenced by the pretensioner equipped belt having locked with the belt spooled out. The subject was traveling straight, down the hill. The subject does not recall the crash and felt she may have blacked out. The vehicle traveled straight while the roadway curved to the right. Eventually, the vehicle traveled off of the left (south) roadside, up and across a mountable curb and into a large pine tree on the south roadside. The vehicle's driver- side frontal impact air bag deployed. The impact caused the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise (approximately 100-degreres) and rebound away from the tree where the vehicle came to rest in the eastbound number-one lane facing southeast. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury(s)
