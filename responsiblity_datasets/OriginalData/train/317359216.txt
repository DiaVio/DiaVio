This case involves a 55 year old, restrained, female driver in a 2007 Chrysler 300 Touring four door sedan (V1). The driver of V1 was restrained by the available three point manual safety belt. The frontal driver's steering wheel mounted airbag deployed as a result of the crash. There was also frontal passenger airbag that deployed in V1. The other vehicle in the crash was a 2003 Ford Taurus four door sedan (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours on a dry, five lane, two-way city street that was straight and level. The roadway ran east and west with a center turn lane for each direction and two straight through lanes for both directions. It was cloudy; however, there were no other adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 64 kph (40 mph). V1 was traveling west in lane one of the westbound lane approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic light. V2 was traveling east in the center turn lane approaching the same intersection. V2 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection. V1 attempted to crossover the intersection. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid an impending collision by braking. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2. After impact with V2, V1 rotated slightly clockwise and departed the roadway to the right where it swiped a light pole with its front right fender then its right rear quarter panel. V1 continued off the roadway and came to rest in a private parking lot facing west. V2 rotated counterclockwise after impact and came to rest in lane one of the eastbound lanes, facing west. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 received serious injuries in the crash and was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment.
