The case vehicle, a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 4x4 pick-up truck, was westbound on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt roadway. It was dark and there was no adverse weather. The case vehicle drifted off the north side of the road, stuck a small post and then struck a 40-cm tree with the left side of its front end. After impacting the tree, the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and the right quarter panel struck a 14-cm by 14-cm wooden post, breaking it off at its base. The case vehicle came to rest facing southwest against the tree. The 32-year-old male driver was restrained by an integrated three-point belt. The steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a local hospital with serious injuries and later transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
