This case involved the 26 year old restrained female driver of a 2008 Toyota 4Runner sport utility vehicle (V1). There were no other occupants in V1. The driver was properly restrained by the three point safety belt system and had a deployed frontal airbag. The crash occurred at night on a dark, unlit interstate highway. The trafficway was straight with a negative 2% grade and divided by a grassy median with guardrails in the immediate crash area. The roadway was asphalt and was dry with no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 113 kph (70 mph). V1 was traveling south in the left of two lanes at the posted speed limit when it departed the left side of the roadway prior to the beginning of the guardrail. V1 continued traveling south in the median approaching a bridge overpass. V1 struck the first of three bridge support columns with its frontal plane. V1 came to rest at the column and was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center where she was hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries.
