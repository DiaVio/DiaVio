This severe frontal crash involved a 51 year old female who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a deployed frontal air bag and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions in the four one-way southbound lanes of a divided freeway with paved shoulders and barriers on each side. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Chevrolet Venture minivan, was southbound in lane one of four. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Toyota Prius four door hatchback, was southbound in lane three. Both V1 and V2 began to change lanes into lane 2. V2's right rear impacted V1's left front. V2 then began to rotate clockwise in lane 2 ahead of V1. The front of V1 then impacted the right side of V2 in lane two. Both vehicles came to final rest with V1 facing southeast in lane 2 and V2 facing northwest across lanes 2 and 3. V1 was damaged and towed. V2 was driven from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant.
