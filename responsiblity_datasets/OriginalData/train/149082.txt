Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2009 Pontiac Vibe, 4-door wagon was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural highway. It was dusk, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. V1 had been traversing a straight section of road and as it entered a left curve, V1 continued straight and ran off the right-side of the road. V1 struck a delineator post with the front end and continued somewhat parallel to the road, along a downgrade slope. V1 encountered a sudden upslope (road bed/berm of an intersecting road) and the undercarriage of V1 struck this embankment causing V1 to vault and go airborne. V1 crossed the intersecting road while airborne and the front of V1struck a large tree on the opposite side of this road approximately ten meters above the road grade. V1 fractured this tree top, rotated clockwise and impacted the ground with its rear plane approximately 50 meters from its initial launch point. V1 continued in an easterly direction, rolling primarily about its longitudinal axis through a brushy woodlot coming to rest on its left side facing east. V1 was was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 67-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. Additionally, both the right and left side curtain air bags deployed.
