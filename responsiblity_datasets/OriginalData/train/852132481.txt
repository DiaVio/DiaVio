This two vehicle head-on crash occurred through a curve of a two lane, two way highway at night with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Dodge Durango utility vehicle, was travelling westbound with the curve in the highway to the right. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Dodge Durango utility vehicle, was eastbound on the same highway with the curve to the left. V2 entered completely into the westbound lane in the curve and the full front of V1 impacted the full front of V2. Post impact both vehicles rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest together at the point of impact. Both vehicles were severely damaged and towed from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant with no other passengers in V1. This case driver, a 48 year old female, was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt with a pre-tensioner and the front steering column air bag deployed. She sustained numerous serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
