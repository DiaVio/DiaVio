Case vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Chevrolet Camaro, was turning left from a side street to go southbound on a seven lane, two way roadway with a middle left turn lane for both directions and a speed limit of 40 mph/64 kpmh. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Mazda MX-6 compact two door coupe was southbound in lane 3 when the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles were directed southwestly and the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1 again as it rotated clockwise off the roadway to the right. V1 then impacted the front spoiler and the left front tire into the rails of railroad tracks that ran parallel to the west of the roadway. V1 came to rest facing northeast on the tracks. V2 continued beyond V1 and came to rest facing south off the roadway. Both vehicles were disabled and towed. The case occupant is the front right passenger of V1, a 38 year old female, who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt. The right side impact created intrusion of the door panel into the case occupant's postion. The case occupant was transported to the trauma center.
