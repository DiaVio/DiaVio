This two-vehicle crash occurred just past noon on a two-lane, dry, bituminous, median divided, stop sign controlled roadway that intersected with a slightly curved four-lane, dry, bituminous, median-divided roadway that has a flashing caution light above the intersection. The four-lane roadway runs south to north and the two-lane, controlled roadway runs east to west.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup truck was traveling westbound. V1 was attempting to cross the intersection. As V1 entered the intersection, the left side of V1 contacted the outside right tire on the third axle on vehicle two (V2). Post-impact, V1 deflected to the right, rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing north on the shoulder of lane one. This vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 16 kmph for V1 and 16 kmph for V2.

V2, 1998 Western Star tractor pulling one empty semi trailer was traveling northbound in lane one. As V2 passed through the intersection, V1 attempted to cross. V2 locked its brakes and steered to the left but was unable to avoid the impact with V1. V2 was driven from the scene.

The driver of V1 was a 77 year-old female. No interview was obtained for V1, but the driver of V2 stated that the driver of vehicle one entered the intersection looking towards her right away from his vehicle. Thus, inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1 was determined as the critical reason for the critical event for this crash.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
