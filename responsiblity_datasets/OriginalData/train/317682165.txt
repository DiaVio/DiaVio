This case involves a restrained 42 year old female driver in a 2013 Nissan Altima (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side airbags, and dual side curtains. The frontal steering wheel mounted airbag, right outboard seatback mounted airbag, and right side curtain all deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on a wet, dark, two-lane, two-way roadway during a rain shower. The southbound lane had an uphill slope and curved to the left. The posted speed limit was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane while negotiating a left curve. As V1 reached the apex of the curve, V1 began to slide with its rear leading. V1 departed the roadway while in a counterclockwise yaw. As V1 departed the roadway its right front door contacted a sign (event 1). After impact with the sign V1 went down a large embankment where it contacted a tree with its right side (event 2). The impact with the tree caused V1 to rotate slightly clockwise. V1 continued and contacted three small saplings with its front (events 3, 4 & 5). After impact with saplings, V1 contacted an 85 cm diameter tree (event 6) and a smaller tree with its front left corner (event 7). The impact with the large tree caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and contact another small tree (event 8) with its right and another tree with its right rea (event 9. V1 came to rest after impact with the trees facing southeast. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center by ground ambulance where she was treated for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
