This case occupant is a 33 year old female driver who was seat belt restrained with frontal and side air bag deployments in a rollover crash and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred at an unknown time at night with clear, dry conditions on a two lane, two way highway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Honda Element, was southbound where the roadway began to curve to the left. V1 continued straight and departed the roadway to the right into the ditch. The front of V1 impacted a culvert that deployed the frontal air bag and fired the seatbelt pre-tensioners for this case occupant's seated position. V1 then had a minor frontal impact with a small tree before it travelled down an embankment rolling over to the left. The left side impacted the ground and V1 came to final rest facing west on this left side. Some boulders caused some direct damage to the left fender near the base of the A-pillar area at this final rest location. V1 was damaged and towed, and the roof was removed for extrication. This case occupant driver was the only person in V1. The case occupant is a 33 year old female who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt with pre-tensioners and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deploying on impact with the culvert and the roof side rail curtain bags and seat back side bag deploying during the rollover event and impact to the ground. This case occupant was located approximately eight days from the crash date and was transported to the trauma center with serious injuries.
