This case involved the restrained 19 year old female driver of a 2005 Honda Accord four door sedan (V1). There was one other vehicle involved, a 1993 Toyota 4Runner four door sports utility vehicle (V2). The driver of V1 was utilizing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had deployed side impact airbags. The left seatback mounted airbag and left head curtain airbag deployed in the crash. The frontal and right side airbags did not deploy. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a rural two lane wet asphalt roadway. The roadway was straight and level and it was raining at the time of the crash. V1 was eastbound, traveling on a narrow gravel driveway attempting to turn left onto the roadway in order to go north. V2 was traveling south at approximately 72 kph (45 mph). V1 reportedly stopped at the end of the driveway, then pulled out onto the roadway. The front of V2 struck V1 in the left side, causing V1 to rotate approximately 90 degrees and travel off the east side of the roadway to final rest. V2 came to rest forward of impact angled across both lanes of traffic. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized.
