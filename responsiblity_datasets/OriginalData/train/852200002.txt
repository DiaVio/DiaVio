This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours, under clear weather conditions on a dry roadway. Vehicle one (V1), a 2009 BMW 335i two door coupe, was eastbound in lane one of a two lane, two way state highway. In the area where the crash occurred, the eastbound asphalt travel lane is straight with a slight downhill grade. The lanes are bordered by narrow paved shoulders and sloped ditches with rockery. The driver of V1 was traveling straight ahead, and departed the roadway to the right. V1 traveled in the ditch for a distance and left rear side swiped some rocks with minor damage and the left rear tire impacted a boulder, resulting in moderate damage. V1 continued traveling east and its front lower bumper then impacted an embankment, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt buckle pretensioner and deployment of the air bags. V1 then rotated counterclockwise, and began to rollover to the right. V1 completed two quarter turns before coming to final rest on its top, facing northeast in the ditch. V1 was towed due to damage.
