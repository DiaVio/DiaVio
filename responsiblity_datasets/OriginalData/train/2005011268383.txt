V1, a 2003 Ford Focus 4dr, was southbound on a 2 lane, 2 way, rural, straight, level, gravel roadway. The roadway had just been graded and new gravel applied. It was daylight at the time of the crash and there were no adverse weather conditions. V1 lost control on the loose gravel, went into a counterclockwise yaw, exited the roadway to the left (east side of road) and struck a tree >10cm with it's front. The driver was uninjured. V1 was towed due to damage.

A complete driver interview and vehicle inspection was obtained for V1. The crash happened less than 100 meters from the driver's residence. The elderly driver was familiar with the vehicle but had only started driving recently after not driving all winter. She was familiar with the route but had only driven on the freshly graded/graveled road once when she left home earlier to run an errand. She was properly licensed for the vehicle was not complying with the corrective lenses restriction at the time of the crash. Instead she was wearing non-prescription sunglasses. She was not late or in a hurry but a witness observed that she was going at a high rate of speed when she lost control. There were no indications of fatigue or medical conditions contributing to the cause of the crash. The vehicle inspection revealed that all 4 tires were over inflated. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The vehicle's pr-event movement was going straight, the critical pre-crash event was off the edge of the road on the left side and the critical reason was poor directional control e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected.

Associated factors were possible side effects of medication and driving without prescription lenses. Contributory factors were that the tires were over inflated and the coefficient of friction for the roadway was reduced due to freshly applied gravel.

There was no indication that alcohol was involved.
