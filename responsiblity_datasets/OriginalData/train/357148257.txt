This case involves a right side impact to the case vehicle, a passenger car by the front end of a medium truck. The 71-year-old male driver, 70-year-old male right-front passenger and the 73-year-old female right-rear passenger were the occupants of the case vehicle. The case vehicle, a 2007 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, four-door hatchback, was eastbound on a dry, level, asphalt, two-lane road approaching a four-way intersection with a divided seven lane road. For east-west traffic the intersection is controlled by a stop sign. A public utility vehicle was parked in the southbound lanes in the south-west corner of the intersection. Vehicle two (V2) 2001 Ford Super-duty medium truck was northbound in the outside lane. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection it crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the case vehicle on the rear portion of the left-front door and forward of the gas cap cover on the quarter panel. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise. The vehicle rode over a mountable curb and departed the roadway at the northeast corner and came to rest straddling the roadway, the sidewalk and a private lawn. V2 came to a controlled stop north of the intersection in its original travel lane. The restrained 71-year-old male driver, unrestrained 70-year-old male right-front passenger and the restrained 73-year-old female right-rear passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. All occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center. The driver was treated and released. Both the right-front and right-rear passengers sustained serious injuries and were enrolled as case occupants. Note: The available right-side curtain air bag did not deploy.
