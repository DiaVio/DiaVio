Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Suzuki Aerio sedan, was traveling north in lane five of a five lane roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV, was traveling south in lane five of a six lane roadway and was approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection and the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 came to final rest in the intersection. V2 traveled off the southwest corner of the intersection, where it struck a metal guardrail with its front before coming to final rest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and the case study occupant was a 64-year-old male. He was the sole occupant of V1 and was not utilizing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. Both frontal airbags deployed in V1. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
