Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Nissan Frontier, King Cab SE, 4x4 pickup was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural highway. The driver of V1 was returning home following an afternoon of duck hunting and his truck carried approximately 200 kg of cargo (e.g. flatbottom boat, decoys, weapons, hunting dog, cargo topper, etc.). Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4x4, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same highway and was behind a non-contact vehicle. It was dark, raining, and the bituminous roadway was wet. Both V1 and V2 were traveling positive grades, approaching a hillcrest, when the driver of V2 moved into the westbound lane to pass slower traffic. V2 continued passing traffic and upon reaching the hillcrest the driver saw V1 and steered to the left but could not avoid striking V1. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique, offset mode. The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 40 degrees and come to rest in the northside ditch facing west-northwest. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing north-northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 34-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and subsequently airlifted to a regional level-one trauma center.
