Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Chevrolet Suburban, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of a three-lane, two-way roadway (one lane eastbound, one eastbound left turn lane, and one westbound lane) and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1983 Ford E150 Club Wagon, van was traveling west in the westbound left-turn lane of the same road and was approaching the same intersection as V1 but from the opposite direction. It was dark, but lighted, the sky was cloudy and the bituminous roads were dry. The driver of V2 attempted to turn left at the 4-leg intersection and the driver of V1 could not avoid a collision. The front of V1 struck the front of V2. Both vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 38-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 34-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted airbag deployed. The 10-year-old male second-row center passenger was not using the available lap belt. The 15-year-old female third-row left passenger was using the available three-point seat belt. The 13-year-old male third-row right passenger was using the available three-point seat belt. All five occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital. The case occupant later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
