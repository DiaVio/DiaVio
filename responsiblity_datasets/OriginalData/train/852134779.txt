This crash occurred during daylight hours at a freeway interchange with wet roadway surface and overcast conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Mazda CX-7 wagon was eastbound in lane one of two one way lanes divided on the freeway that curved to the left and then merged with an on-ramp lane that then formed three lanes. Vehicle two (V2), 2004 Honda CRV, was eastbound in the merge lane and was changing lanes into the travel lane of V1 when the left side of V2 impacted the right side of V1. V1 then moved to the left across lane 2 and departed the roadway left on to the paved shoulder and impacted the front of V1 into the concrete barrier. The bumper frame height of V1 caused V1 to ride up on the barrier and the front left tire impacted a light pole positioned on top of the barrier. V1 then bounced off the barrier and began to rollover to the right six quarter turns and came to final rest in lane 2 facing mainly north on its roof top. V2 post impact with V1 veered off the roadway to the right across the merge lane and south shoulder and the front of V2 impacted a steel guard rail. Both vehicles were damaged and towed. The driver of V1 is the CIREN subject and no other passengers in V1. This case driver, a 68 year old male, was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belts, the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed and the belt pre-tensioners activated. During the rollover event both the left and right roof side rail curtain air bags deployed. The front seatback mounted thorax air bags did not deploy. This case driver was sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
