Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Chevrolet S-10 pick-up, was traveling south on a two-lane, two-way curvey roadway. The roadway curves to left and then to right and the crash occured at the begining of the curve . The speed limit on this roadway is 15 mph (24 km/h) with downward gradiant. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the bituminous (asphalt) road was dry during the evening hours. The driver of V1 drove straight instead of negotiating the curve, departed the roadway to his right side. The left side of the frontal plane impacted the utility pole in a 'narrow end engagement' manner, as it rotated counter clockwise from event 1, the right side plane of V1 impacted a tree before coming to final rest. The 30-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed.
