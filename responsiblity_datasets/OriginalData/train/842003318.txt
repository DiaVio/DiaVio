This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 21 year old male driver of a 2002 Mitsubishi Galant 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a frontal collision with a 1996 Ford Escort LX 2-door hatchback (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on the inboard lane of a multi-lane divided highway and proceeding straight. It was dark (not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 2 was westbound also in the inboard lane of the eastbound lanes. Vehicle 2 struck Vehicle 1 in a full frontal crash configuration. Upon impact, both vehicles rebounded rearward and came to rest in close proximity to the point of impact in the eastbound lanes. Vehicle 1 came to rest facing southeast, and Vehicle 2 came to rest facing northwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The restrained 20 year old male front right passenger of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local medical facility with police reported non-incapacitating injuries (unknown level of treatment). Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
