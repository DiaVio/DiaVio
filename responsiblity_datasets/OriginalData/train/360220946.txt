This frontal impact crash case involves an 89 year old male driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained multiple moderate severity injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours at a T-intersection. There is a five lane, two way east-west roadway that consists of two eastbound, two westbound and one center left turn only lane (for westbound traffic). The intersecting north-south roadway consists of five asphalt travel lanes with an uphill grade for northbound vehicles. At the intersection, there are two southbound lanes, two left-turn only northbound lanes, and one right turn only northbound lane. At the time of the crash, it was clear with dry roadways. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT2 four door sedan, was traveling east in lane two and vehicle 2 (V2), a 1986 Toyota Camry four door sedan, was traveling north in the inside left turn only lane, intending to make a left turn at the intersection. V1 entered the intersection as V2 was making the left turn. The driver of V1 braked but the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. After the impact, V1 traveled a short distance east and came to final rest facing northeast in the intersection. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the middle of the intersection, facing southwest. V1 and V2 sustained disabling damage and were towed from the scene. The case occupant is the 89 year old male driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. He was transported home by taxi, went to a local hospital hours later, and was then transferred to the trauma center where he was hospitalized for three days.
