This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 17-year-old male belted driver of a subcompact hatchback with a deployed curtain airbag. He sustained severe injuries in a near-side impact to a large tree; the case vehicle sustained moderate damage. The crash occurred during late afternoon hours on a wet road in the rain. A 2008 Scion xD five-door subcompact hatchback (Vehicle 1) was traveling north on a two-way, two-lane rural road negotiating a left curve. The bituminous road was on a 3% downhill grade with positive superelevation in the curve. V1 crossed left into the oncoming lane of travel. The driver then steered right and the vehicle began a clockwise yaw. V1 crossed back over its original lane of travel and departed the right side of the road. V1 traversed a short downwards embankment before striking a large tree (50 cm diameter) with its left plane (Event 1). The impact was focused to the left front door/B-pillar junction. V1 came to rest at the point of impact and was towed due to damage. The 17-year-old male driver was belted at the time of the crash. The available retractor pretensioner was actuated and found with the belt in the payed-out position at inspection. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The left curtain airbag deployed. The available steering wheel hub, top right instrument panel, and first row outboard seatback airbags were not deployed in the crash. No other airbags were installed. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of severe injuries. No other occupants were in the vehicle.
