Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of v1 was 'this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side.' The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded was a 'driver related performance error of poor directional control-failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected.' A Contributing Factor coded was inexperience, as the driver had only been driving for one year, and for only two months with a full size van. Additional Contributing Factors were coded for the ambient conditions which included wind gusts, and inefficient braking and steering inputs. An Associated Factor coded to this vehicle was the moderate condition of the transmission, and low tread on the right side tires.
