The crash occurred in the southbound lane four of an eight-lane highway divided by a positive barrier (four lanes in each direction). Lane one in the southbound direction of the roadway was an on-off ramp/merging lane from the freeway. A newly posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) was due to road construction. There was a 3 percent uphill grade in the southbound direction on this wet bituminous roadway. The sky was dark and cloudy with light to moderate showers during the early evening on a weekday. Traffic was heavy on this well traveled road during a pre-holiday period.

A 43-year old male was driving a 1995 Chevrolet S-10 pick-up truck. He stated that he was on his way home, leaving from work 40 minutes prior to the accident. He was traveling southbound in lane four when he thought he hit a pothole with his left rear tire and lost control of his vehicle. The vehicle traveled along the left curb side, striking the curb with the left front tire, 47.5 meters south of the first event, causing V1's path to begin rotating counterclockwise over the curb and onto the median where it continued another 32 meters into a cement barrier, bringing V1 to rest facing east. Investigation revealed a curb edge adjacent to a storm drain was not made flush, exposing the sharp corner of the curb 18 cm X 18 cm into the roadway. It was thought that the crash probably would not have occurred if the curb had been made flush with the storm drain. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was " Performance error, poor directional control." Associated factors include rain and a dark cloudy sky. A roadway related factor was coded due to the curb not being flush with the storm drain. The exposed curb corner protruded 18 cm into the roadway at a height of 18 cm and 36 cm from the left yellow lane line.
