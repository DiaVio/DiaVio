This single-vehicle collision occurred during evening darkness hours on a weekend. The crash occurred on an east-west roadway, at the intersection of a north-south roadway. The speed limit for eastbound traffic is 56 kmph (35 mph), and the intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1989 Chevrolet Beretta two-door coupe, was traveling eastbound in the second lane of a three-lane, divided (five lanes overall, divided by a raised median), dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the intersection. V1 moved left and engaged the brakes, skidding longitudinally across the intersection, where V1 departed the road onto the raised median on the opposite side. V1 impacted the raised curb with the front wheels, and then impacted a signal light pole with its front plane, bringing the vehicle to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The male driver and passenger of V1 fled the scene, unidentified. A witness at the scene heard the screeching of tires, and turned in time to see the impact. He was unable to provide any details leading up to the point of impact. Inspection of V1 revealed that the tires were severely under-inflated. The critical precrash event for V1 was: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1 as a driver related factor: type of driver error unknown.
