Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Oldsmobile 88, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle four (V4), a 2000 Buick LeSabre, 4-door sedan was stopped, facing west in the westbound lane of the same road, awaiting to turn left at the intersection. Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Freightliner, tractor-trailer was also stopped, facing west and was behind V4. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Volvo, tractor-trailer, was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road and was behind V3. Vehicle five (V5), a 2002 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane and was behind V1. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road surface was wet. The road has a negative grade in the eastbound direction and a positive grade in the westbound direction. The driver of V2 recognized that V3 was stopped in the road and swerved to the left as an attempted avoidance maneuver, but the front of V2 struck the back of V3. V3 then moved forward and struck the rear of V4. V2 continued to the left, jack-knifed, and entered the eastbound lane as V1 was entering the intersection area. The driver of V1 swerved to the right in an attempted avoidance maneuver, but the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotated in a counterclockwise manner, depart the right side of the road and come to rest in a private lawn facing south-southwest. V5, which was traveling behind V1, braked and steered left as an avoidance maneuver, but the front of V5 struck the front of V2 and came to rest. All five vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 24-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant/lone occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
