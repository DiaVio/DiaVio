This two vehicle daytime collision occurred in the intersection of a three lane one way arterial road, and a two-lane two-way arterial road that passes through a tunnel. Both roadways are paved with concrete. Both roadways are controlled by on-color traffic signal with a pedestrian signal, East/West has a uphill grade of 12%, North/South roadway has an downhill grade of -1%.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 BMW 328i sedan driven by a twenty two (22) year old male, was traveling east in lane one going straight. Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Toyota Corolla sedan driven by a forty six (46) year old female, was traveling north in lane one exiting the tunnel and entering the intersection to go straight. V2 had already entered the intersection as V1 entered. The front of V1 impacted with the left side of V2 causing them both to deflect to the north/east corner of the intersection. The tunnel and buildings that border the roadway created a reduced sight line and conspicuity prior to vehicle's entering the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage and V2 was driven from scene.
