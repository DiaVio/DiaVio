This frontal crash case involves a 55 year old restrained female driver, seated in the front left seating position, with deployed air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during the morning hours (daylight) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a bituminous three lane roadway (two southbound lanes & one northbound lane) that curves to the right for our case vehicle. The roadway has a negative 2% grade and is separated by a double yellow line. The case vehicle (V1), a 2002 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan, was being driven northbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, crossed over the double yellow line traveling across both southbound lanes before traveling off the road edge (down a slight embankment) before impacting a large tree with its front bumper. This was V1's final resting position. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 55 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (buckle type pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The available side seat back mounted air bag did not deploy as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned at the middle position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The driver's (right) seat track was deformed vertically (upward) and laterally (to the left) due to the crash. This in turn forced the driver's seat back slightly forward (on the right side). The seat cushion for this seating position does not seem to be affected by the seat track deformation. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by helicopter for treatment of her injuries.
