This case occupant is a 22 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in two near-side impacts followed by a moderate rollover event. Both front row side impact air bags and both curtains deployed during the crash. This occupant sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred in darkness, under rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Honda Accord four-door sedan, was westbound in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway. In the area where the crash occurred, the westbound asphalt travel lane has a slight downhill grade and curves to the right. Adjacent to the westbound lane is a parking lane, followed by a curb, sidewalk and a concrete block retaining wall. As V1 was negotiating the curve, the driver traveled into the eastbound lane, then overcorrected and began to go into a clockwise yaw. V1 crossed over the westbound lane and parking lane, traveled up and over the curb and its left front impacted the block wall, resulting in the deployment of the left side impact and left side curtain air bags. Then the left rear impacted the same wall, resulting in moderate damage. V1 rotated sharply clockwise and as it traveled back onto the roadway, it began to rollover with the left side leading. V1 completed two quarter turns and came to final rest back in the roadway on its top, facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 22 year old male, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the crash, his seat back mounted side air bag and left roof side rail mounted curtain deployed. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
