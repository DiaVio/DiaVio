This crash occurred on the southern roadside of a two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway consisted of one lane in each direction with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The bituminous roadway curved to the right and featured an uphill grade. It was late evening on a weekday, it had been raining/snowing and the roadway was wet.

V1, a 1993 Ford Probe with one occupant, was eastbound negotiating the curve. V1 failed to remain under control, lost traction and began rotating clockwise. As the vehicle continued rotating, it left the roadway on the right side and sheared through a telephone pole. After contacting the telephone pole the vehicle rolled over six quarter turns. During the rollover the vehicle slid on its roof and contacted a curb on its left side. The vehicle came to final rest on it roof in a field. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 25-year-old male, suffered minor injuries but refused transport. He stated that as he negotiated the curve he suddenly lost control of his vehicle and started to rotate. He originally claimed that something on his vehicle possibly the sway bar broke and than claimed black ice. Neither claim could be proven as no black ice was found and vehicle damage prevented investigation of the sway bar.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a driver related factor, traveling too fast for conditions, wet roads. It had been raining for a while that evening and the roadways were wet. The driver failed to bring his vehicle to a safe speed to negotiate the curve with wet roads. Another associated factor is that the rear tires on the vehicle were worn to 2mm. There is also the possibility that the driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash. This cannot be verified as the test was contaminated.
