This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 24 year old female driver of a 2000 Ford Explorer XLT 4x2 4-door sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions (non-deployed). The case vehicle sustained severe damage as a result of a left side impact with a large diameter tree (event #1). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, with rainy conditions as the road was wet. Vehicle 1 entered the left curve and partially departed the right (west) pavement edge. The driver steered left to return to the roadway, and then steered (hard) right in order to prevent the vehicle from departing the left side of the roadway. This right steering maneuver resulted in a clockwise rotation as Vehicle 1 once again departed the right (west) side of the roadway. As the vehicle departed the right pavement edge, it entered a cluster of trees. The left side surface impacted a large diameter tree resulting in severe damage (event #1). During post-impact spinout to final rest, the left front side surface swiped an adjacent tree, which resulted in minor damage (event #2). Falling tree branches contacted the right rear roof side rail area (event #3). Vehicle 1 came to rest in close proximity to point of impact (off the west pavement edge of the roadway) facing northwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The case occupant's injuries had a MAIS of 4 and an ISS of 26. The driver's height was 162 cm (64 in), and weight was 85 kg (187 lb). Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
