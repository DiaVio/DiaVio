This case involves a 37 year old restrained female driver of a 2010 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan. The crash type is a sideswipe with a 2002 Toyota Tacoma pickup, followed by a sideswipe with a 26 cm tree and a frontal with an 11cm tree. The crash occurred on a two-lane rural roadway during daylight hours. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The area of impact was straight and level. The 2010 Hyundai Elantra (V1) was traveling north with a 4% uphill grade prior to the crash. The 2002 Toyota Tacoma (V2) was southbound with a 1% uphill grade prior to impact. V2 was turning left across the northbound lane to enter a parking lot. The driver of V1 swerved sharply to the left in an attempt to avoid contact with V2. The right side of V1 impacted the right rear bumper area of V2 in a swiping type impact. V1 continued traveling northwest approximately 35 meters and departed the left side of the roadway. V1's left side swiped a large tree and rotated counterclockwise striking a small tree with it's front. V1 continued rotating counterclockwise and came to rest on the grass shoulder of the road facing south. V2 was not disabled and was driven into the parking lot for final rest. The driver of V1 was restrained by the available 3-point lap and shoulder belt and airbags. The steering wheel mounted airbag, the left seat-mounted side impact airbag and the left side curtain airbag were deployed in the crash. She sustained serious injuries and was air lifted to a level one trauma center where she was hospitalized. There was also a 13 year old female passenger in the front right seat of V1. She was restrained by the lap and shoulder belt and a deployed frontal airbag. She was transported by ground to a trauma center for treatment of non-serious injuries.
