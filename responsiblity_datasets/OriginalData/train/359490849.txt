The case occupant in this frontal crash is a 26 year old female driver who was involved in a severe head on collision with another vehicle. This driver was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment and she sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a state highway, during daylight hours, under clear weather and wet roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of one northbound and two southbound asphalt travel lanes. The outside southbound lane merges with the inside lane near the point of impact. For north and southbound vehicles, the travel lanes are straight and have uphill grades. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Equinox compact utility vehicle, was traveling north in the northbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2009 Jeep Wrangler compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in the inside southbound lane. As the two vehicles approached one another, V2 drifted into the northbound travel lane and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's front row seat belt retractor pretensioners and the deployment of both frontal air bags. V1 underrode and was overpowered by V2. V1 traveled a short distance south and came to final rest still in the northbound lane, facing northeast. V2 rotated clockwise and came to final rest near the point of impact, facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 26 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in V1.
