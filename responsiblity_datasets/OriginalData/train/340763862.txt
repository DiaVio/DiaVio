This case involves a frontal-impact, in an off-set mode between two passenger cars. Both collision partners are case vehicles in companion cases. Vehicle one (V1) a 2011, four-door Chevrolet Impala was southbound on a, dry, level two-lane asphalt roadway negotiating a gentle right-sweeping curve. It was daylight and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2) a 2007, four-door Pontiac G6 was northbound on the same roadway. It was daylight and cloudy. V1 crossed the center line, entered the path of V2 and struck it in a frontal, off-set to the left, mode. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise as a result of the impact. V1 came to rest straddling the southbound shoulder and travel lanes facing east-northeast. V2 departed the roadway of the east side and came to rest on a private lawn facing west-southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The restrained 58-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to an outside hospital where he died approximately three hours post-crash. The restrained 16-year-old female driver of V2, the case vehicle in the companion case, was the only occupant of the vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact and roof side-rail curtain air bags. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a cooperating outside hospital and was enrolled as a case occupant.
