Vehicle two (V2) was northbound traveling in the center lane of the same traffic-way also approaching the intersection. The case vehicle made a left-turn and crossed the path of V2. The front of the case vehicle struck the front of V2. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise. Both vehicles came to rest facing northeast in the northeast quadrant of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The sole occupant the 42-year-old male driver was restrained by a three-point belt, but steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with moderate injuries to two body regions.
