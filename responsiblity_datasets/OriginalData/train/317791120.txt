This case involves a 69-year-old female who was 152 centimeters (5 feet) tall and weighed 58 kilograms (127 pounds). She was the restrained driver of 2008 Chevrolet Aveo four-door sedan involved in a severe head-on collision with a 2002 Chevrolet Malibu four-door sedan. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. There was also a less severe left quarter panel impact with the front of a 2012 Toyota Sequoia sports utility vehicle. All injuries are attributed to the intial impact. The driver's frontal airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. On impact the case occupant moved forward in relationship to the vehicle. The subarachnoid hemorrhage was attributed to the head contacting the left instrument panel (right of the steering wheel) with a possible confidence. The cord contusion with dislocation, bilateral flail chest and hemothoraces, and liver laceration were attributed to the steering wheel via the airbag with a certain confidence level. The right lung laceration was attributed to the rib fractures. The left radius and ulna fracture were attributed to the left front door with probable confidence. The right tibia and fibula fractures were attributed to contact with the knee bolster with probable confidence.
