Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was dark, snowing, and the bituminous road was snow-covered. The driver of V1 lost control on the icy roads and began to rotate in a clockwise manner. V1 departed the right side of the road and the left side of V1 struck a tree. V1 came to rest against the tree. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 49-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
