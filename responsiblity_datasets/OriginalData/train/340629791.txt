This case involves an impact between the left fender of a passenger car and the front of a passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2009 four-door, hatchback Pontiac Vibe was travelling in the inside westbound lane of a divided dry, level asphalt five-lane traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Mercury Montego was in the eastbound left-turn lane of the same traffic-way. As V2 made a left-turn through the intersection it entered the path of the case vehicle. The front of V2 struck the left-fender door of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise into the north leg of the intersecting road where it came to rest facing northeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing west at the northwest corner of the intersection. The restrained 58-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed frontal impact and curtain air bags. She sustained multiple moderate injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
