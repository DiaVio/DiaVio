This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 65 year old female driver of a 2009 Nissan Sentra 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions, side (seat back mounted) air bags for the front outboard seating positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions. The driver frontal air bag, side air bags, and curtain air bags deployed as a result of an oblique angled collision with a 1998 Buick Park Avenue 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two-lane rural roadway, and proceeding straight. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the same roadway, and negotiating a left curve. As Vehicle 2 reached the apex of the curve, it reportedly departed the right (south) pavement edge. Driver steering maneuvers re-directed Vehicle 2 back into the travel lanes in a counterclockwise rotation, and across the path of the westbound Nissan. As Vehicle 2 crossed the westbound lane, the right side surface was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 1. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. At this point, Vehicle 2 departed the left (north) pavement edge and entered a wooded area. Secondary impacts to Vehicle 2's back surface (trees) were reported by police. Vehicle 1 came to rest in the westbound travel lane facing southwest. Vehicle 2 came to rest in the wooded area (off the north pavement edge) facing southwest. Following the crash, the belted 65 year old female driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment. She was subsequently transferred to a nearby trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage. It should be noted that both occupants of Vehicle 2 were pronounced deceased at the scene.
