This case involved a 22 year old unrestrained male driver of a 2011 GMC Canyon crew cab pickup truck (V1). The driver was not utilizing the available three point manual safety belt and there were no deployed airbags in the crash. The crash occurred at night on a dark, unlit two lane roadway. The roadway surface was asphalt and it was dry at the time of the crash. The roadway curved to the left with a 3% upjhill grade. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was traveling west at approximately 100 kph (62 mph) when it drove off the right side of the pavement. V1 traveled about 50 meters along the roadside before impacting several trees. The right rear quarter impacted two small trees, then the frontal plane came in contact with a large double tree (approximately 60 cm in combined diameter). V1 then sideswiped a large 40 cm tree with its right front quarter panel and door. V1 came to rest at the trees and was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center for treatment of injuries sustained in the crash.
