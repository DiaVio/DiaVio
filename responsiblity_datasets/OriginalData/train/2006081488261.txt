A single-vehicle collision occurred at mid-afternoon on a Wednesday. The collision occurred on a busy two-way, 5-lane bituminous roadway, in lane one. The pre-crash roadway is level, and straight. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Oldsmobile Achieva, was traveling westbound in lane one when the vehicle departed the right side of the roadway at an angle of 5 to 10 degrees. V1 crossed over a sidewalk and then the front impacted a sign supported by wooden posts and then chain link fence. The undercarriage scraped along the ground as the vehicle went off of a dirt drop off into a construction site. The undercarriage impacted a concrete riser and then the front of V1 impacted a large dirt and gravel pile where it came to rest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1 is a 79-year-old male who reported to be in fair health, he has no hearing impairments, and his vision is corrected with his glasses. He has a pre-existing condition of lung disease, and he was well rested. The driver takes the following medications: Ditiazem, Atenolol, Triamterene/HCTZ, and Litodram. He does not work, as he is retired.

For this trip he had just had lunch and was heading to the bank. The driver of V1 stated that as he was driving down the road he got dizzy and was very disoriented and just blacked out. He was traveling in the right lane, and the next thing he knew he was bailing out the passenger door as the car filled up with smoke from the airbags.
