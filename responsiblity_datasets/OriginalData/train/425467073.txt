This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 79-year-old, male driver with a deployed airbag. This occupant sustained serious injuries in a small overlap, frontal impact. The case vehicle was a compact sedan which was struck head-on by a mid-size sedan. The crash occurred mid-afternoon in clear weather on a dry roadway. A 2010 Kia Forte sedan (V1) was traveling south approaching an intersection on a two-lane, two-way, suburban roadway. A 2007 Acura TL sedan (V2) was traveling north approaching the same intersection. The grade for both vehicles was level. V1 began turning left at the intersection in front of V2. The front right corner of V1 collided with the front of V2 (Event 1). After impact, V1 rotated counter-clockwise 120 degrees before coming to rest partially off the northeast corner of the intersection. V2 rotated clockwise 60 degrees before coming to rest on the shoulder off the northeast corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 79-year-old, male case occupant. He was belted and his retractor pretensioner actuated. His steering wheel hub airbag deployed, as well as the right passenger side outboard seatback and right curtain airbags. The available driver's side outboard seatback and left curtain airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
