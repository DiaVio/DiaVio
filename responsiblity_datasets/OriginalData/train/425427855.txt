This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 50-year-old female belted driver with deployed frontal and side airbags. This occupant sustained severe injuries in a near-side impact. The case vehicle was a compact sedan struck on the left side by an intermediate size sedan. The crash occurred midafternoon in clear weather on a dry road. A 2008 Nissan Versa compact sedan (Vehicle 1) was stopped facing west at a suburban bituminous four-way intersection controlled by signal lights. The grade in V1's direction of approach was 2% downhill. A 2005 Chevrolet Malibu intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) was traveling north approaching the same intersection. The grade for V2 was level. V1 proceeded to turn left at the intersection as V2 was crossing through. The left front fender of V1 was struck by the front plane of V2 (Event 1) resulting in moderate damage. V1 rotated clockwise as V2 rotated counterclockwise. The back plane of V1 impacted the right rear quarter panel of V2 in a side-slap-like configuration (Event 2). V1 traveled north after impact, coming to rest in the roadway north of the intersection. V2 came to rest a short distance from impact in the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 50-year-old female case occupant. She was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The steering wheel hub, curtain, and side seatback airbags deployed. The airbags for the other occupant positions did not deploy. The driver was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance where she was later transferred to a trauma center for treatment of severe injuries.
