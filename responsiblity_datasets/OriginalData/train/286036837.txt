The focus of this case is on a 84-year old female who was the properly restrained driver (case occupant), of a 2005 Hyundai Elantra 4-door sedan (V1, case-vehicle) which was impacted by a 2006 Infiniti QX56 4-door utility vehicle (V2). V1 then traveled off the roadway, impacting a fence. The two vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours(daylight and sunglare) at a T-intersection with two bituminus lanes (one in each direction north and south) for our case vehicle and two bituminous lanes (one in each direction east and west with a dead end intersecting north and south). for V2. The weather was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions. The speed limit for both of these roadways was 25 miles per hour (40 kmph). Vehicle one (V1-case vehicle) was traveling northbound and V2 was traveling eastbound. As V2 approached the intersection (dead-end/stop sign), it attempted to execute a right turn in order to proceed south when it impacted the left side of V1 with its front. After initial impact, V1 lost control and traveled across the southbound travel lane, exiting the roadway before impacting a fence at final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to moderate damage and V2 was driven from the scene with minor damage. The 84 year-old female driver of V1 was correctly wearing her available lap and shoulder harness (pretensioner did fire). Her available steering wheel mounted frontal air bag and the side seatback mounted thorax air bag did not deploy in the crash. The driver (case occupant) was airlifted from the scene to an area trauma center where she was hospitalized for 14 days before being released.
