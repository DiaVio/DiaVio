The case occupant is a 52 year old female driver who was involved in a moderate front end collision with another vehicle. This driver was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment and she sustained serious injuries. This intersection crash occurred during the early morning hours in darkness with overhead street lights, clear weather and dry roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of two east and two westbound asphalt travel lanes, with left turn only lanes present at the intersection. The travel lanes are straight with an uphill grade for westbound vehicles and a downhill grade for eastbound vehicles. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2012 Toyota Yaris four door sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lanes, intending to turn left at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2007 Chevrolet Suburban utility station wagon, was traveling east in the inside eastbound lane. V1 turned left as V2 entered the intersection and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's left frontal air bag. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest, facing southeast, just east of the intersection, straddling the eastbound travel lanes. V2 continued forward and came to final rest near V1, also facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 52 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
