Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Audi A6 Quattro, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the dirt road was dry. The driver of V1, for an unknown reason, departed the left side of the road, climbed a short embankment and vaulted into an agricultural field. V1 rolled 5-quarter turns with its left side leading and came to rest in the field on its left side. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 40-year-old driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the seatback-mounted airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one tauma center.
