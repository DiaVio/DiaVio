This frontal impact case occupant is an 80 year old female driver, restrained with a manual shoulder belt, with frontal and knee air bag deployments. She was involved in a minor left side impact, followed by a moderate frontal impact and she sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under overcast weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Toyota Prius four door hatchback was southbound in lane three of a five lane, one way freeway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2010 Honda Insight four door hatchback, was southbound in lane four, traveling slightly behind V1. In the area where the crash occurred, the concrete travel lanes are straight and level, with jersey barriers present on both sides of the roadway. As V1 was traveling south, the driver began to change lanes to the left. The left side of V1 impacted the right side of V2, resulting in minor damage. V2 moved to the left and came to final rest facing southeast, straddling lanes four and five. V1 continued south, crossed lanes four and five and then the front of V1 impacted the east jersey barrier, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of her frontal and knee air bags. V1 traveled a short distance south and came to final rest in lane five, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 was driven from the scene. The case occupant is the driver of V1, an 80 year old female, who was restrained with the shoulder portion of her manual lap/shoulder belt. This driver reportedly was sitting on the lap portion of her seat belt and did not have it on at the time of the crash. Her steering column mounted frontal and lower left instrument panel mounted knee air bag deployed during the crash. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center, where she was hospitalized for four days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The driver of V2 was not injured.
