This crash occurred on a straight, level, two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway ran east and west, was bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35mph). It was evening on a weekday, it was raining and foggy, and the roadway was wet.

V1 was a 2007 Suzuki Grand Vitara, driven by a 26 year-old female. V2 was a 2001 Toyota Highlander, driven by a 30 year-old female. V1 was traveling eastbound when it left the roadway on the right side and struck a utility pole on the side of the road. The pole was sheared in half and part of it fell into lane two. V2 was traveling westbound. When the driver of V2 saw the pole blocking her lane she began to move into the left hand lane to go around it. As she began to cross the double yellow line V1 returned back onto the roadway and struck V2 in the left side. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was "driver related factor, unknown performance error." While the roadway was wet, there was no pooling, and driving at the speed limit should not have produced any problems in vehicle control. The driver was charged with DUI and transported to a local hospital.

The driver of V2 stated that she was traveling eastbound when she saw the broken utility pole in her lane. She slowed down and began changing lanes into the westbound lane to go around the pole. As she entered the other lane V1 came from her front left and impacted her left side. She did not think that V1 had it's lights on, as she never saw it until the impact. It should also be noted that the driver of V2 was listed on the PAR with a minor injury.

V2 was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore no Critical Precrash Event or Critical Reason was coded to the driver of V2.
