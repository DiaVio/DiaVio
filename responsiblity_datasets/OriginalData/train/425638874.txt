This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 43-year-old female unbelted driver with deployed curtain airbags. This occupant was driving a 2012 Ford Edge full size utility vehicle when she sustained severe injuries in a multi-event crash with a minivan and a metal utility pole. The case vehicle sustained moderate damage. The crash occurred during midafternoon daylight hours on a dry road at a four-way intersection. A 2012 Ford Edge full size utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was traveling west approaching the intersection, which was controlled by a tri-colored signal. The grade on approach was 7% downhill. A 2000 Chrysler Town & Country minivan (Vehicle 2) was traveling south approaching the same intersection on a 5% downhill grade. Both vehicles proceeded through the intersection intending to proceed straight. The right rear plane of V1 was impacted by the front of V2 in a right-angle configuration (Event 1). The impact aft of V1's center of mass caused it to rapidly rotate clockwise after impact. V1 traveled a short distance southwest while rotating 240 degrees before impacting a large metal utility pole which was 35 cm in diameter (Event 2). V1 came to rest at the point of second impact. The pole was scratched but otherwise undamaged. V2 came to rest in the southwest corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was operated by a 43-year-old female driver. She was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by absence of loading marks to the belt components. The retractor pretensioner was not actuated in the crash. This vehicle was not equipped with either buckle or anchor pretensioners. Both right and left curtains deployed during Event 1 as noted in the CDR report. The available but non-deployed airbags included the steering wheel hub, right instrument panel, and outboard seatback airbags. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of severe injuries.
