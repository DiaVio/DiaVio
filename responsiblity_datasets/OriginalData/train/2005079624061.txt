This two-vehicle crash occurred during early morning daylight hours at an intersection controlled by a tri-light signal on colors. The roadway consists of three lanes of east and three lanes of west travel and one left turn lane for each direction. The roadway is asphalt, dry, level and undivided. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The speed limit in both directions is 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Ford F150 pick-up driven by a 53 year-old male, was traveling west in the number four left turn lane intending to make left turn. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Honda Prelude coupe driven by a 29 year-old female, was traveling east in the number three lane. V1 stopped in the middle of the intersection to wait for an opportunity to make an unprotected left turn. The driver then observed the light change to yellow and said that two vehicles in the number one and two lanes of eastbound traffic began to slow for the light so he started his left turn. The driver did not see V2 approaching the intersection. The driver of V2 applied her brakes and steered right. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V2 came to rest at impact.
