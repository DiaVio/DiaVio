This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 83 year old male driver of a 2009 Toyota Prius. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions (non-deployed). The case vehicle was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side air bags for the front outboard seating positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions (non-deployed). Vehicle 1 sustained moderate frontal damage as a result of a rear-end impact with a 2002 Dodge Durango 4x2 4-door sport utility (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was southbound in the outboard lane of a multi-lane urban roadway. Vehicle 2 was also southbound, and traveling on the inboard lane (ahead of Vehicle 1). It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 2 began to slow for traffic congestion ahead, as Vehicle 1 abruptly changed lanes to the left. The driver of Vehicle 1 failed to observe Vehicle 2 slowing ahead, as the front left area subsequently impacted the back right area of Vehicle 2. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. The height variance, in combination with possible pre-impact driver braking, produced an under-ride configuration between both vehicles. The area above Vehicle 1's bumper engaged the structure along Vehicle 2's undercarriage, resulting in additional moderate damage. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and came to rest straddling the centerline of the road facing southwest. The initial impact pushed Vehicle 2 forward, resulting in a secondary rear-end impact with Vehicle 3, a 2009 Subaru Impreza. Vehicles 2 and 3 came to rest in the southbound (inboard) travel lane, facing south. Following the crash, the driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed due to disabling damage, as Vehicle 3 was driven from the crash site.
