This case involves a moderate oblique frontal impact with a compact SUV. The case occupant is the 20-year-old male driver. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle (V1) a 2004 4-door Hyundai Elantra was westbound on a dry, level, concrete road approaching a three-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV was eastbound approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle approached the intersection, it made a left turn and entered the path of V2. The front-end of V2 contacted the front-end of V1 in an oblique, full-frontal mode. The case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and side-slapped the left side of V2. V1 came to rest facing east, straddling the center line approximately 40 feet from point-of-impact and V2 came to final rest facing east on the south edge of the roadway approximately 240 feet from the point-of-impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 20-year-old male driver was not restrained, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The right-front 16-year-old male right-front passenger was reported as restrained by the police and the top instrument-panel air bag deployed. The driver was transported to an outside facility before being transferred to a level-one trauma center. He was enrolled as a case occupant. The right-front passenger was taken to an outside facility and was treated for minor injuries and released.
