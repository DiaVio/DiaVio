The case occupant was a 60 year old female who was the restrained driver involved in a frontal crash with frontal air bag deployment and sustained severe injuries. The crash occurred during the early morning hours in an underground tunnel that was illuminated by street lights with dry conditions. The collision occurred on a two lane, one-way state highway in an area without any traffic controls. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway consists of two northbound lanes that curve to the left, are level, and are divided by a dashed yellow lane line. The case vehicle one, (V1), a 2008 four-door Hyundai Sonata was being driven northbound in the left lane and vehicle two (V2), a 1995 four door hatchback Landrover Discovery was being driven southbound in the northbound lane already occupied by V1. The crash occurred when V1 and V2 were both negotiating a curve in the roadway. The driver of V1 steered right while braking, but the vehicles collided head-on in a front-to-front crash configuration. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise with V1 coming to final rest facing south in the right lane and V2 coming to rest facing northeast in the left lane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by the case occupant, a 60 year old female who was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. The available frontal steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The driver of V1 was transported to a CIREN center with serious injuries.
