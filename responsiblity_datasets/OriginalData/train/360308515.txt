This case occupant is a 51 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a near-side collision with a pole, followed by another near-side non-horizontal impact and a minor rollover event. The driver's frontal air bag deployed during the crash and this occupant sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred in darkness with overhead street lights, under rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Chevrolet HHR station wagon, was southbound in lane two of a five lane, two way roadway. The asphalt travel lanes are straight and level, with curbs present on both sides of the street. As V1 was traveling south, the driver moved from lane two to lane one and clipped the west curb with V1's right front tire. The driver lost control of V1 and it began to go into a clockwise yaw as it continued south. V1 departed the roadway to the right and while still in a yaw, V1's left side impacted a concrete planter, resulting in minor damage. V1 traveled up and over the planter and then its left front impacted a metal pole, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the frontal air bag. During this event, V1 began to tip to the left as it rotated sharply clockwise. Then the left rear of V1 impacted a wood pole, resulting in moderate non-horizontal damage. V1 continued to rotate clockwise and began to rollover to the right. V1 completed one quarter turn and came to final rest on its right side, facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 51 year old male, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the crash. This occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
