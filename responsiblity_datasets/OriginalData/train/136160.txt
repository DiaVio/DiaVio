Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford F150, 4-door pickup truck was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was entering a left curve. The driver of V1 failed to maintain control and V1 departed the right side of the paved road edge. The driver of V1 steered left, re-entered the travel lane but crossed the centerline, northbound lane and departed the left paved edge of the road. The driver steered back to the right, entered a clockwise yaw, crossed back over the centerline and tripped over the left side tires and began a left-side leading rollover. V1 rolled across the southbound lane and into the ditch along the right-side of the road. V1 rolled eight quarter turns with the left side leading and came to rest on its wheels, along side the road edge, facing north-northeast. The 29-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground amublance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage.
