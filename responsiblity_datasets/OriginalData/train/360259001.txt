This 79-year-old female (160cm/70kg, 5'3"/154lbs) was the front right passenger of a 2012 Ford Focus four-door hatchback that was involved in a moderate severity frontal impact. She was wearing the manual lap/shoulder seatbelt and the retractor pretensioner actuated on impact. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock at 0 degrees. On impact her body moved forward and was restrained by the seatbelt with loading on the webbing. Both knees impacted and scuffed the glove compartment door. Some transfers and a scuff on the right instrument were documented where her wrist or forearm made contact. This patient suffered severe injuries including: an injury to the thoracic aorta with pseudoaneurysm, multiple left rib fractures with pulmonary contusion and hemothorax, a left diaphragmatic laceration, an L3 compression fracture, transverse process fractures of L2, L3, and L4 and a left ulna fracture. The chest injuries were all sourced to compression from the seatbelts. Increased abdominal pressure from the belts was thought to contribute to the diaphragm rupture and aortic injury. The spine fractures were attributed to compression/flexion as the pelvis loaded the seat cushion with the torso restrained by the seatbelt. The ulna fracture was sourced to contact with the right instrument panel.
