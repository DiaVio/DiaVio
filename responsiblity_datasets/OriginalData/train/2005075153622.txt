The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.

The driver was in a rental vehicle and was on a road that he had only driven once before. He was on his way from his hotel to a business meeting. The driver was traveling at a constant velocity and did not stop to yield the right of way to V2. He did not see V2 prior to making his left turn.
