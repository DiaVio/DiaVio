This moderate severity rollover crash involved a 35 year old female driver who was restrained with an integrated manual lap/shoulder belt and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred in a dark area at night on a two lane, two way gravel road under clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe, was eastbound on this gravel road that had a downgrade and curved to the left. On the north side of the road was a dirt and sand embankment and then to the east it became a level field. As V1 was negotiating the curve, V1 started to rotate counterclockwise sliding on the gravel road. The front part of V1 then began to depart the roadway to the left. The front of V1 impacted and swiped down the embankment. The front right tire then departed the roadway and dug into the dirt that then tripped V1. V1 then rolled over to the right eight quarter turns with the back end partially on the gravel road. V1 then came to rest on all tires fully off the roadway facing northwest in the grass field. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1 who is a 35 year old female. She was wearing the integrated manual lap/shoulder belt and no airbags deployed in the vehicle. She sustained serious injuries and was taken to an outside hospital and then later was transferred to the trauma center. No other passengers were in V1.
