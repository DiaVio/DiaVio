This case occupant is an 80 year old female driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with side curtain air bag deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours, during rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Escape compact utility vehicle, was northbound in lane one of a three lane, divided asphalt freeway. The precrash roadway curves to the left, then straightens out and has a slightly uphill grade. V1 was approaching an off ramp that exited to the right. The gore point between the exit ramp and the freeway consists of a grassy area, followed by an area of small trees, shrubs and tall grass. Just north of this is a ditch that is approximately 4'-5' (1.2m-1.5m) deep and at the time of the crash, this ditch was partially filled with muddy water. The driver began to exit the freeway at the off ramp area, then departed her lane to the left. V1 departed the left side of the off ramp and traveled north through the grassy area. V1 continued north and then the front of V1 traveled into the ditch, impacting the muddy area, and resulting in the deployment of both side curtain air bags. V1 came to final rest with its front end in the ditch, facing north. V1 was towed disabled. The case occupant is the driver of V1, an 80 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her roof side rail mounted curtain air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center, where she was hospitalized for eleven days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
