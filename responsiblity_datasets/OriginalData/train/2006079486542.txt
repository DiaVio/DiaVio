This single-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred on a curved stretch of a two-lane, positively divided, bituminous expressway. In the area of the crash, the speed limit is 72 kmph (45 mph), and the approach towards the curve has a posted advisory speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). A metal guardrail with wood posts borders the right roadside. At the time of the crash, the roadway was dry and free of defects, and there were no adverse weather conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Honda Civic 2-door coupe, was traveling westbound and approaching the curvature. V1 departed the road to the right side, striking the guardrail with its front plane. V1 rotated clockwise from impact and rolled four quarter-turns towards its left side. As V1 came back on its wheels, V1 rolled backward into the guardrail again, damaging the back left corner. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

The 20-year-old male driver of V1 reported that he has no memory of the events for the drive. Medical records indicate a BAC test result of 0.221 taken about two hours after the crash. He reported feeling fatigued on the day of the crash, and had less-than-normal sleep the night before. He has received no formal driver training, and has only five months driving experience. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: This vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the event was coded: Driver-related performance error, poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected). This was selected based on the confluence of fatigue, inexperience, and alcohol consumption of the driver.
