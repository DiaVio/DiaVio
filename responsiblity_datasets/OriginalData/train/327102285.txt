This case involves a moderate to severe small-overlap frontal impact with a median barrier. The case occupant is the 31-year-old male driver. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2004 four-door Cadillac CTS, was traveling northbound on a six-lane divided highway in the outside lane. It was dark but lighted, dry and cloudy. The right-front passenger perceived an impending impact with a guardrail and grabbed the steering-wheel. He then steered the vehicle left in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid an impact. After side-swiping the guardrail, the case vehicle crossed through the middle, left and distress lanes and struck a concrete median barrier with its front-left end. The impact caused the vehicle to "ride-up" the concrete barrier and roll right side leading. The left quarter-panel struck the top of the median barrier before the case vehicle came to rest on its top, facing southeast in the distress lane. The case occupant is the 31-year-old male driver. He was not restrained, but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The right-front passenger was not restrained, but the top mounted instrument-panel air bag deployed. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant. The 23-year-old female right-front passenger was also transported to a level-one trauma center with police reported possible injuries.
