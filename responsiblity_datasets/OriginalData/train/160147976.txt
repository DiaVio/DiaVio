This side-impact crash involves a 25-year-old restrained male with deployed frontal air bag who sustained a serious injury. This crash occurred during daylight hours and in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a six lane, two-way trafficway, divided by a grass center median into two three lane, one-way roadways. The case vehicle (V1), a 2005 Honda S2000 convertible, was traveling east in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford Expedition utility vehicle, was traveling west in lane four of the trafficway and Vehicle 3 (V3), a 2006 Ford Crown Victoria sedan, was traveling west in lane six of the trafficway. Vehicle one attempted to pass another vehicle by steering left at which time the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle. V1 entered a counterclockwise rotation and traveled across the grass median. The right side of V1 contacted the front of V2. V2 then came to final rest in the roadway. V1 continued after contact with V2 and came into V3's path and the front of V3 contacted the right of V1. V3 came to final rest in the roadway and V1 came to rest on the northern shoulder of the roadway. All three vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 25-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point manual belt. Both available frontal air bags deployed during impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported by helicopter to a level-one trauma center.
