This single vehicle daytime collision occurred during morning daylight hours. The collision occurred heading south on a one way, covered highway with three lanes of travel curved to the right. The pre-crash roadway is level, dry concrete paving, with a turn to the right leading into a long straight section. Access to the roadway is fully controlled, with no junctions in the immediate area of the crash. The posted speed limit for the roadway is 80 kmph (50 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Mazda 626 sedan, driven by a 18 year-old male was traveling south in lane 2. When V1 entered the turn to the right, the car turned too quickly and the front of V1 hit the right curb and barrier to the inside of the turn. V1 then continued to the left across all three lanes of travel and the left front wheel hit the left curb, causing the rim to break. V1 then continued approximately 15 meters (50 feet) along the left wall before coming to rest. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event assigned to this driver as driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn. The driver was issued a summons for speeding by police. An additional factor was the driver's failure to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected.
