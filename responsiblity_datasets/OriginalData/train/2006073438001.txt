This single vehicle crash occurred on the northbound lanes of a three-lane one-way center barrier wall divided expressway. The concrete roadway is straight, level, and dry at the time of the crash. The crash occurred at dusk on a weekend, and traffic was moderate. The posted speed limit on the roadway is 88 KPH (55 MPH).

V1, a 1997 Mitsubishi Diamante 4-door driven by a 32-year-old female, who was the only occupant, was northbound in the third lane. A non-contact vehicle was in lane two next to V1 slowly overtaking it. Per interview with driver V1, she lightly applied brakes in order to allow the non-contact vehicle to pass on the right. The driver stated the brakes locked and V1 began to enter a clockwise yaw, skidding across the second and first lanes and departed the roadway right. V1 proceeded off road down into a drainage ditch and struck the far side of the ditch embankment with its front end, then rotated clockwise to final rest across the ditch, facing west. The driver of V1 was treated on-scene, and later after the crash was transported by friends to a local trauma center for treatment. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

The physical evidence collected at the scene could not verify a lock-up of the wheels on the right side to initiate a clockwise rotation as the vehicle left the travel lanes. There was a skid/yaw mark from the left rear tire as the vehicle rotated clockwise off the roadway.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling-off the edge of the road on the right side." The Critical reason for the Critical Event was coded "Driver related factor-type of driver error unknown." There was no evidence to indicate a vehicle failure and the type of driver error is unknown.
