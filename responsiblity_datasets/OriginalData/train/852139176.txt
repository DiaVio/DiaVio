This crash occurred in the curve of a two lane, two way country road during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Kia Spectra four door sedan was eastbound on this road and negotiating the curve right. Vehicle two (V2), a Isuzu 4000 Series Box Van was traveling westbound and entered the curve to the left. V1 crossed the centerline in the curve and became completely in the opposite lane when the full front of V1 impacted the front of V2. V2 pushed V1 backwards from the point of impact and the vehicles sustained contact to final rest with V1 facing southeast and V2 facing northwest. Both vehicles were damaged and had to be towed. The case occupant is the driver of V1 with no other passengers in the V1. This case driver is a 29 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. The case driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
