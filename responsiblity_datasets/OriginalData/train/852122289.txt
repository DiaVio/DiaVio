This crash occurred during daylight hours with dry, overcast weather conditions on an on-ramp to a highway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Toyota Prius four door was northbound on this single lane on-ramp and departed the roadway to the left as the lane curved slightly to the right as it merged into the highway. V1 then returned back on to roadway crossing to the right over the lane and then departed the roadway to the right down a slight embankment before impacting the front of V1 into a bridge overpass. The front bumper and below first made contact with the ground and the frontal impact with the bridge started above the bumper into the hood and extended into the front greenhouse structure of V1. V1 became pinned under the bridge and required careful removal by the tow crew and fire response teams. The vehicle was damage and towed. The driver is the case occupant and the only person in V1. The driver is a 63 year old male who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt with the belt pretensioners firing. The front steering column mounted air bag deployed in his position upon impact. This driver was critically injured and transported to the trauma center.
