This case involved the belted eighteen year old female driver of a small pickup responding to a head-on collision with a larger pick up. The case vehicle damage rating was 'severe' as a result of the twelve o'clock principal direction of force impact. The frontal-impact air bags deployed and the subject received serious injuries. This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane east/west, undivided, trafficway traveling through a rural area. The road was curved with a slight downhill grade from east to west. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry, during the mid-morning, weekend crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2003 GMC Sonoma, 3-door pickup) was traveling westbound, negotiating the right curve. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and frontal-impact air bags. The eighteen year old female driver (case occupant/sole occupant) was using the belt, as evidenced. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2001 Dodge Ram) was traveling eastbound negotiating the left curve. The case subject (driver V1) looked down to check her speedometer when she allowed the vehicle to 'drift' to the left, across the centerline, and into the path of V2. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a 40 percent left offset, head-on impact. V1's frontal-impact air bags deployed as the vehicles rotated counterclockwise. The case vehicle sustained extreme intrusion of its left instrument panel, steering assembly and floorboard. V1 separated from V2 and slid to its final rest facing southeast across the roadway. V2 came to rest on the south shoulder facing west approximately 2 meters rearward of the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injuries.
