This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 19-year-old female belted driver with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant was driving a compact sedan when she sustained critical injuries in a rear-end crash with a compact coupe. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The crash occurred during early morning hours on a dry unlit roadway. A 2013 Honda Civic intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling northeast at a high rate of speed on a one-way, two-lane interstate highway. A 1993 Honda Civic compact coupe (Vehicle 2) was traveling ahead of V1 in the right lane. Both vehicles were negotiating a very slight left curve. V1 continued in the right lane of travel and overtook V2, impacting V2's rear plane with its front in an underride frontal pattern (Event 1). V2 began rotating counterclockwise, and after rotating 200 degrees, struck V1's left rear quarter panel with its front plane (Event 2). V1 rotated counterclockwise 180 degrees and struck a W-beam guardrail on the southeast road edge with its left rear plane (Event 3) before returning to the roadway and coming to rest. V2 continued rotating counterclockwise after Event 2 and struck the same guardrail with its front plane (Event 4) before coming to rest on the southeast shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was operated by a 19-year-old female driver. She was belted with actuated retractor and anchor pretensioners. No buckle pretensioner was installed. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed during Event 1. The left outboard seatback and both curtain airbags deployed during Event 2. The available right front instrument panel and right outboard seatback airbags did not deploy, as the right front seat was unoccupied. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of critical injuries.
