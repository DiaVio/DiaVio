This frontal crash involves a 80-year-old unrestrained male right front passenger with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours under wet, rainy conditions. The collision occurred at the intersection of a two lane, one way roadway and a three lane, two way roadway. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2005 Toyota Prius being driven westbound on the two lane, one way roadway. Vehicle two (V2) is a 1999 Toyota Corolla being driven north on the three lane, two-way roadway. The crash occurred when both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V1 contacted the right of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the northwest portion of the intersection and both were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 67-year-old female who was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deploy. The right front passenger (case study occupant) was an 80-year-old male who was unbelted but had his instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deploy. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
