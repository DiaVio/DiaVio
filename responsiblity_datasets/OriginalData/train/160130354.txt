Vehicle One (V1), a 1998 Volvo S70 sedan, was traveling south in lane three of a three lane roadway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle Two (V2) a 2002 Toyota Tacoma, was traveling north in lane one of a four lane roadway. The trafficway was controlled by a tri-color traffic signal. V1 attempted to make a left turn and the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest in the northeast part of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to damage. Vehicle One contained two occupants, a driver and a right front passenger (the case study occupant). The driver of V1, an 18-year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had his frontal airbag deploy. The driver of V1 was uninjured and was not treated. The passenger of V1, a 19-year-old female, was wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her frontal and seat-mounted side airbags deploy. The passenger in V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
