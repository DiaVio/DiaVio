This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 54-year-old male belted driver of a 2010 Dodge Caliber compact 5-door hatchback (Vehicle 1). This vehicle was involved in an offset frontal collision with a 2008 Chevrolet Silverado C3500 cab chassis based truck (Vehicle 2). The driver had the benefit of deployed frontal airbags. He sustained serious injuries in the crash. V1 was eastbound on a two-lane rural road and negotiating a right curve on an uphill approach to a three-way intersection. It was daylight with no adverse weather conditions and the road was dry. Traffic control consisted of a stop sign for southbound turning vehicles. Vehicle 2 was westbound on a downhill approach to the same intersection. V1 slowed and began to turn left at the intersection, across the path of the westbound Chevrolet. As V1 crossed the westbound lane, the front right area impacted the front left area of V2 (Event 1). Impact resulted in moderate damage to V1. Both vehicles came to rest in the northwest sector of the intersection facing northwest and were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage. The 54-year-old male belted driver and sole occupant of V1 was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt. The case vehicle was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions as well as curtain airbags. The driver frontal airbag and knee bolster airbag deployed in the crash. The driver was transported to a nearby trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries.
