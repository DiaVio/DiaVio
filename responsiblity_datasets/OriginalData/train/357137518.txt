This case involves an impact between the right side of a station wagon and the front end of a passenger car. The 42-year-old female right-front passenger of the station wagon is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2007 Chevrolet HHR station wagon was northbound lane of a wet, level two-lane asphalt road approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 2005 2-door Ford Mustang was westbound in the through lane of the intersecting three-lane road. It was daylight and raining. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection it crossed the path of V2 and the front of V2 struck the right fender and right-front door of the case vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate counterclockwise. The case vehicle rode over a mountable curb, departed the intersection at the northwest corner, and traversed a private lawn and the front of the vehicle struck a house. It came to rest facing north. V2 came to rest on the road side straddling the curb facing north-northwest. The 45-year-old male driver and the case occupant, the 42-year-old female right-front passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. Both occupants were restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel and top instrument-panel air bags deployed. Both occupants were transported to a outside hospital. The case occupant was later transferred to level-one trauma center with critical injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
