Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Nissan Maxima, with an unknown number of occupants, was westbound in the second travel lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1923 Ford Model T, with one occupant, was southbound in the first travel lane. V1 entered the intersection and the front of V1 impacted the left of V2. V1 continued west and fled the scene without stopping. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing northeast in the intersection. V2 was towed due to damage. The driver of V2 did not sustain any injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 fled the scene and was not identified.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling - crossing over (passing though) intersection. The critical reason for V1 was coded: driver related factor - type of driver error unknown.

The driver of V2, a fifty-three year old male, was heading from home to "cruise." This driver had been driving for about fifteen minutes, drives the route monthly and is familiar with the vehicle. The driver stated the light was green. He did not realize that V1 was not going to yield the right-of-way until just before impact and stated that he applied the brakes prior to impact.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment - from crossing street, across path. The critical reason for V2 was coded: not coded to this vehicle. This driver falsely assumed that V1 would stop for the red light before entering the intersection.
