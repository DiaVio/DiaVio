This crash occurred in the early evening on a weekend while still daylight, on a two-lane undivided roadway. The westbound asphalt road was downhill with a grade of 5 percent and was curved sharply to the left. The posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25mph).

V1 was a 1996 GMC Jimmy driven by a 21-year old male. V1 was traveling westbound negotiating the curve when it departed the right road edge and traveled into an area of trees and brush. The driver attempted to steer back onto the roadway but was unable to and impacted a small tree. V1 continued forward and impacted another small tree. The combination of rough terrain, the impacts with the trees, and the yaw of the vehicle caused V1 to vault over onto its front end. V1 came to final rest against a third tree with its front end in the ground and the top of the vehicle resting against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The Critical Pre-crash Event was V1 traveling off of the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was poor directional control. This was influenced by a blood alcohol level of .168 and smoking marijuana, which the driver admitted to during the interview. The driver stated that he remembered trying to steer back onto the road but did not recall other details. It also appears that the vehicle was traveling over the 25mph speed limit, based on the distance traveled and the damage incurred to V1.
