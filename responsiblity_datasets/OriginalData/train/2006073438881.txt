This single vehicle crash occurred late afternoon during daylight hours in the northbound lanes of a three lane, one way highway. This is a straight, level, bituminous roadway. It was evening, the weather was raining and the roadway was wet. Traffic was flowing freely. The speed limit on the roadway is 64 kmph (40 mph).

Vehicle one (V 1), a 1995 Lincoln Continental sedan driven by a 40 year-old male, was proceeding north in the third lane after just having merged onto the highway from the left. There was a non-contacted semi/tractor-trailer in the first lane next to V 1. Driver of V 1 wanted to exit right farther ahead so he began to change lanes to the right, into the second lane. At the same time the non-contacted semi/tractor-trailer began to change lanes to the left. Per interview, driver V 1 realized that the semi was moving left so he steered left and fully applied his brakes. V 1 began a counterclockwise rotation sliding left across the third lane and then departed the roadway left. The right side of V 1 struck the end of the west side guardrail, then rolled over onto it's top. V 1 came to final rest approximately 11 meters (36 feet) off the roadway to the left, on it's roof. V 1 was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
