This case focuses on an unrestrained 68 year old female driver in a 2015 Nissan Altima (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual first row side airbags, and dual side curtains. The driver's frontal airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. V2, an unknown year model GMC Sierra pickup truck and V3, a 2011 GMC Savanna van were also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a curved dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway that ran north to south. This roadway was intersected by another two-way, two-lane, dry asphalt roadway. The intersecting roadway travel lanes ran east to west. The eastbound lane was controlled by a stop sign. The two roadways together formed a "Y" shaped intersection. V1 was negotiating a left hand curve while traveling south in the southbound lane. V2 was negotiating a right curve while traveling north in the northbound lane approaching V1 and V3. V3 was stopped in the eastbound lane at the stop sign. As V1 and V2 entered the intersection, the driver of V2 steered left in an attempt to turn left and head westbound onto the intersecting road. The driver of V1 applied her brakes in an attempt to avoid a collision. The front of V2 contacted the front of V1. After impact, V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the southbound lane facing northwest. V2 continued to travel northwest into the eastbound lane of the intersecting roadway. The front of V2 contacted the front of V3. V2 came to rest on the roadside of the eastbound lane, facing northwest. V3 rotated clockwise and was pushed rearward and came to rest in the middle of the east and westbound lanes, facing south. All vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital by ground; however, she was later transferred to a level one trauma center for additional treatment of serious injuries.
