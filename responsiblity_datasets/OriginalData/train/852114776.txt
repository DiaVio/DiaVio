This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Escort, four door sedan, was southbound on a two lane, two way street and stopped at a stop sign at an intersection with a speed limit of 30 mph/48kmph. Vehicle two (V2), a 1978 Mercedes 280, four door sedan, was westbound on a two way, two lane street with a downgrade and no traffic control at the intersection. The speed limit for V2 was 35 mph/56kmph. The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn and then began to accelerate to try and avoid V2. V2 began to brake and steer left before the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 was then deflected post impact into the southwest corner of the intersection and departed the roadway. The front of V1 impacted two small trees and then a sign post, that also flipped on to the top of V1, before it traveled down a grassy embankment where it struck another small tree before it impacted the front of V1 into a house. The impacts to the sign post and all the small trees were very minor. The driver of V1 is the case occupant, a 48 year old female, who was wearing her lap/shoulder belt and the frontal airbag deployed on impact into the house. No other occupants were in V1. The case occupant was transported to the trauma center and V1 was disabled and towed. V2 was driven from the scene.
