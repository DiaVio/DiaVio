The case vehicle, a two-door 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier was in the inside northbound lane of a four-lane dry, level concrete roadway, approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and there was no adverse weather. Vehicle two (V2), an unknown make and model passenger car was southbound in the outside lane of the same roadway approaching the same intersection. The driver of the case vehicle made a left-turn and crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle at the fender. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise. The case vehicle came to rest in the mouth of the west leg of the intersection at the southwest corner facing southwest. After impact, V2 departed the scene. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. The 42-year-old female driver was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt and the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. The 8-year-old male center-rear passenger was seated on a booster seat and restrained by a lap belt. The driver sustained no injuries. The center-rear passenger was transported to a pediatric level-one trauma center with a serious injury and later enrolled as a case occupant.
