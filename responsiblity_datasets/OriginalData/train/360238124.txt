The case occupant is a 73 year old female driver who was involved in a moderate frontal crash. This driver was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment and she sustained serious injuries. This freeway interchange/intersection crash occurred during evening hours in darkness with overhead street lights, clear weather and wet roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of two east and two westbound asphalt travel lanes. There is a left turn only lane for eastbound vehicles present at the intersection and on the east side of the intersection there is a right turn only lane available for vehicles turning right onto the freeway on-ramp. The travel lanes are straight with an uphill grade for eastbound vehicles and a downhill grade for westbound vehicles. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Volvo XC70 station wagon, was traveling east in the eastbound lanes, intending to turn left onto the freeway on-ramp. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Chrysler PT Cruiser five door hatchback, was traveling west in the inside westbound lane. V1 turned left as V2 entered the intersection and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bag. V1 moved a short distance and came to final rest, facing north, in the eastbound travel lanes. V2 continued forward came to final rest near the north curb, facing west. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 73 year old female driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. The driver's frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries, was taken to an outside hospital and was later transferred to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
