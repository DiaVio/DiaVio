Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was a 1996 Ford Explorer, four-door utility vehicle. There was only one occupant in the case vehicle with the front left occupant (driver) being our case study participant: The driver (case occupant) was a 48-year-old male. A frontal air bag (steering wheel mounted) and a manual lap-and-shoulder belt were available. The steering wheel air bag deployed and it appears the manual safety belt was not in use. This crash occurred in an industrial area on a rainy night, on a wet, level, bituminous, two-lane, north-south roadway, with speed limit 40 km/h (25 mph), illuminated by street lights. At the scene of the crash, the roadway is an approach to a commerical/industrial parking lot with a heavy gate that was closed. The public roadway turns 90 degrees (becoming an east-west roadway) with the gated entry being straight ahead. Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was traveling southbound, approaching the gate. The driver failed to negotiate the right turn in the roadway and continued straight, with the front of V1 impacting the heavy-duty motorized gate. V1 came to rest against the gate. The driver of V1was removed from the vehicle and transported from the scene to a local trauma center where he was admitted for 4 days for injuries received in the crash.
