This case occupant is a 28 year old male front right passenger, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a moderate undercarriage collision followed by a minor rollover event with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours, under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Nissan Sentra four door sedan, was northbound in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway. The asphalt travel lanes have no curbs, with an embankment present on the east side of the roadway and a jersey barrier on the west side. In V1's precrash area, the roadway is level and curves to the left. As V1 negotiated the curve, it began to depart the roadway to the right. V1 traveled a short distance off the roadway, then V1's undercarriage impacted the embankment, resulting in the deployment of the frontal air bags. V1 climbed up the embankment, causing the vehicle to begin to flip over to the left. V1 completed six quarter turns. After completing the rollover event, V1's front right bumper corner impacted the jersey barrier on the west side of the roadway. V1 came to final rest facing northwest, on its top in lane two, with its right front bumper corner still against the jersey barrier. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the front right passenger of V1, a 28 year old male, who was not restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the embankment impact, his top instrument panel mounted front air bag deployed. This passenger sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There was a 24 year old female driver, who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted front air bag deployed during the crash. She sustained minor injuries and was not transported for medical treatment.
