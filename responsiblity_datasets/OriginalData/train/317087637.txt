This case involved a 34 year old restrained female driver of a 2008 Pontiac Vibe four door wagon (V1). The other vehicle involved was a 2004 Lincoln Aviator sport utility vehicle (V2). The driver of V1 was restrained by the manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. V1 was not equipped with side impact or head curtain airbags. The crash occurred during daylight hours and the asphalt roadway was dry. V1 was traveling east on a two-lane residential roadway with an 8% downgrade approaching an intersection with a four-lane divided highway. V2 was traveling south in the left lane of the three straight and level southbound lanes of the divided highway. The intersection was controlled by stop signs for the east/west traffic. V1 stopped at the stop sign and then pulled out to cross over the southbound lanes in order to turn left onto the northbound travel lanes. V2, travelling on the uncontrolled highway, struck V1 in the left rear door and rear quarter panel with its frontal plane. V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 165 degrees to final rest in the westbound lanes. V2 continued forward and came to rest on the right shoulder of the roadway. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of her injuries.
