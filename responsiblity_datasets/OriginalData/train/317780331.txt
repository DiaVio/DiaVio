This case involves a 69 year old restrained female driver in a 2008 Cadillac DTS four door sedan. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual first row side airbags, and dual first and second row side curtains. No airbags deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a two-way, two-lane, dry asphalt roadway. The northbound lane of the roadway curved to the left. There were no adverse weather conditions; however the sky was cloudy. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was traveling north in the northbound lane of the roadway when it drifted completely off the roadway to the right. V1 contacted a pile of asphalt that was dumped onto the roadside near an intersecting roadway with its frontal undercarriage. After contacting the pile of asphalt, V1 continued a short distance and crossed the intersecting two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway. V1 crossed over the intersecting roadway and came to rest on the roadside adjacent to the northbound lane, facing north. V1 was towed from the crash scene; however, it is undetermined if the damage to V1 was disabling. The driver of V1 was taken to a local hospital by ground; however she was later transferred to a level one trauma center where she received additional treatment for the serious injury that she sustained in the crash.
