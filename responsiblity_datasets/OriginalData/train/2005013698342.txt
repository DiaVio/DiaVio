The crash occurred on a two-lane, non-divided, rural, asphalt roadway during the mid afternoon hours of a weekday. The roadway was straight with a negative 5.9% downhill grade. The roadway was dry and the ambient conditions were sunny and clear.

V1, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am, was traveling south over a crest of a hill on the way home from the grocery store. The driver stated that her three-year-old daughter, who was in the back seat, had gotten a hold of a bottle of lighter fluid and that she had turned around to retrieve it. The driver also stated that when she looked back to the road she was off the roadway to the right side; the driver took counter measures by steering hard to the left and overcorrecting to get back onto the roadway. The driver then steered back right and the vehicle lost control by rotating clockwise and departing the roadway. The vehicle, which was in a yaw motion, slid down an embankment and overturned, left side leading, three quarter turns. As the vehicle was overturning, it contacted a tree with its front right fender / hood, then came to final rest on its left side against a second tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

A 21-year-old female drove the vehicle with a 13-month-old male passenger and a 3-year-old female passenger in the second row. All three occupants were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries. The vehicle was towed with moderate damage.

The Critical Pre-crash Event is Off the Edge of the Roadway to the Right. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was an Internal Distraction - reaching into the back seat to retrieve a bottle of lighter fluid from the second row. Associative factors include overcompensation and insufficient braking and steering inputs.
