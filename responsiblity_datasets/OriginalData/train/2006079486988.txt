This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekend afternoon. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a five-lane, two-way, east-west, bituminous roadway. There are parking lanes along both curbs. A two-way left turn lane separates eastbound and westbound traffic, and the speed limit on this road is 56 kmph (35 mph) in both directions. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Mazda Protégé 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound in the first lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Nissan Pathfinder compact SUV, was legally parked along the north curb, ahead of V1. V1 departed the travel lane to the right, where the front of V1 contacted the left side of V2. V1 deflected back into the road and came to rest. According to a Witness statement in the police report, the witness was following V1 and had observed previous swerving motions of V1 about 180-meters (200-yards) prior to the crash location . The witness then observed V1 make a sudden right turn and impact with V2. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 45-year-old male driver of V1 refused to be interviewed. He was arrested and charged with DUI. The police at the scene suspected the presence of alcohol, which was confirmed by the driver; he told the police that he had consumed sixty-four ounces of beer one hour before the crash. The police administered a breath test, which returned a BAC result of .265. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: This vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the right side. Based on the Witness observations of V, it was determined that the driver failed to control the vehicle with skill normally expected.
