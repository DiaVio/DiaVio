This case involves a severe impact to the front of the case vehicle with a tree in a left-offset mode. The case occupant is the 31-year-old male driver. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2004 Toyota Tacoma 2-door pick-up truck, was eastbound on a dry, level, asphalt, two-lane road. It was dark, but lighted and clear. As the case vehicle negotiated a shallow left sweeping curve, it departed the roadway off the right side. The right-front wheel sideswiped a pole and the right-rear tire sideswiped a tree fracturing the wheel rim. The case vehicle then crossed a private driveway and the front end struck a tree >10cm in diameter knocking it over. The case vehicle came to rest facing north-east. The 31 year-old, male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to outside hospital before being admitted to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
