Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 GMC Denali, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of a four-lane, limited access, divided freeway (two lanes eastbound, unprotected grassy median, two lanes westbound). It was dark, the sky was clear, and the concrete roadway was dry. The driver of V1 swerved to the left to avoid two deer that entered the road from the south, crossed the left eastbound lane, and entered the grassy median. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise and slid through the median with the right side of the vehicle leading. V1 tripped over its right wheels in the center of the median (lowest point) and rolled four-quarter turns coming to rest on its wheels in the westbound lanes facing north. The 46-year-old male driver was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. The 16-year-old male right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. The 13-year-old female left-rear passenger was not using the available three-point seat belt and was completely ejected from the vehicle. The 46-year-old female right-rear passenger (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but was not ejected during the rollover event. All four occupants were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and the case occupant was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
