Vehicle One (V1), a 2001 Cadillac Deville sedan, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2004 Lincoln Navigator SUV, was traveling west in lane one of the same roadway approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to make a left turn and the right side of V1 contacted the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest in the northwest corner of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, an 80-year-old female and case study occupant, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the buckle-mounted pretensioner deploy. Neither the frontal or side air bags deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
