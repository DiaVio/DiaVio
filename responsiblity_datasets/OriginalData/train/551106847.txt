This single vehicle crash occurred during rainy conditions at night with no street lights in the area. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Mustang two door coupe, was eastbound on a two lane, two way highway with a speed limit of 50 mph/80 kmph. V1 drifted to the left from the traveled lane and drove off the roadway to the left. V1 continued off road for some distance striking various objects and the embankments of the ditch. V1 first impacted a phone box to front, the left front wheel impacted a landscaped wall, and then the front top left struck some tree limbs. V1 then began to tilt to the right on the embankment as the right side roof area struck a sign post as the front right corner and side scraped and struck the ground. The front left corner of V1 then gouged into the ground causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise as the right lower frame scraped to the ground with the right rear tire impacting also as V1 returned to roadway shoulder coming to final rest partially on the westbound lane facing northwest. Both the driver and front seat occupants were enrolled as case subjects. The driver is a 41 year old male who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt with the frontal airbag deploying on an unknown event possibly event 5 or 6. The front right passenger was a 40 year old female who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt with a frontal airbag deploying during an unknown event possibly event 5 or 6. It should be noted this passenger attempted to regain control of V1 and may have been out of position. The both case occupants were transported to a local hospital with the driver being transferred to the trauma center and the passenger being treated and released. The vehicle was disabled and towed.
