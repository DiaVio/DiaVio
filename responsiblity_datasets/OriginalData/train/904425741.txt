This moderate severity single vehicle rollover collision involved a restrained driver who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours on a two way, two lane highway with paved shoulders bordered by sloping ditches. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Subaru Outback wagon was southbound on this highway that had a gradual curve to the left. V1 continued straight in the curve and departed the roadway to the right. The right side tires were mainly off the roadway on the sloping ditch and V1 began a slight counterclockwise yaw. V1 then returned to the roadway crossed over the southbound and northbound lanes, and then began to rotate clockwise as it departed the roadway to the left down the sloped ditch on the east side. The left side tires then began to dig into the sandy ground of the sloped shoulder as V1 slid laterally. V1 then rolled over to the left eight quarters turns and came to final rest on the sloped ditch facing west. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only person in the vehicle. He was a 49 year old male who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. He was transported to a local hospital with serious injuries and later transferred and hospitalized at a trauma center.
