This single-vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane, not physically divided, asphalt roadway. The northbound lane curves right then straightens out and is downhill in the area of the crash. A mountain recreation area access road intersects this main road in a T- type intersection from the east. A large drainage area lined with large rocks at the base, borders the northbound lane to the right prior to the intersection. The speed limit for the area is 88 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred during the early afternoon with no adverse weather or road conditions present.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Jeep Wrangler was northbound when it departed the right road edge and traveled down the embankment and impacted a large rock with the right front. The vehicle continued forward and traveled up the embankment that borders the side road. It entered the side road from the eastbound edge, crossed the road and departed the westbound edge where it went airborne and its front-end plane contacted branches of a large tree. The vehicle landed on its front plane and rolled end-over-end two-quarter turns coming to rest on its top facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a seventy-nine year old female, stated to the officer-in-charge that she did not know what happened and that the front wheels seemed to go out from underneath her and that she could not steer as it went to the right. A witness stated the Jeep was not driving erratically in any way and could not tell what could have happened to cause this crash.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was attributed to V1 and was coded as a driver related factor: type of driver error unknown.
