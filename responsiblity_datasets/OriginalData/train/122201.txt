Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Saturn SL1, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the right westbound lane of a four-lane divided freeway (two lanes westbound, unprotected grassy median, two lanes eastbound). It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the concrete road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and relinquished control of the vehicle. V1 drifted to the right, departed the right-side of the road and traversed a down-sloping grassy roadside before entering a swampy area below the road level grade. V1 continued through this swampy area and began to climb up the opposite bank of this swampy area when it struck a 45-cm (~18 in) diameter tree with the front end. V1 came to rest against this tree. The 56-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was the only occupant of V1 and was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage.
