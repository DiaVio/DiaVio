This frontal crash involves a 55-year-old restrained male case occupant with deployed air bags who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a three lane, two-way roadway traveling primarily north-south. Traveling south there is a downhill grade and traveling north there is an uphill grade. A double solid line separates the travel lanes. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2008 Kia Rio5 five door that is traveling north on the roadway. Vehicle two (V2) is a 2008 Ford Focus sedan that is traveling southbound on the roadway. The crash occurred when V2 struck a raised curb on the right side of the roadway. Striking this curb caused V2 to veer to the left, where it entered the northbound lane and struck V1 head-on. Both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway and both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 55-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available three point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as well as the left sided curtain air bag. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
