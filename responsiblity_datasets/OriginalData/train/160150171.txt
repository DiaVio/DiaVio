This near-side crash involves a 37-year-old restrained female with a deployed seat-mounted side impact air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred under dry, daylight conditions. The collision occurred at a T- type intersection, between two two-way, two lane roadways. The case vehicle (V1), a 2008 Ford Mustang coupe, was traveling south in lane one of the two lane roadway approaching the end of the roadway at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), was being driven west and was approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise after impact and departed the roadway to the south side, where it struck a fence and a tree with its rear. V1 came to final rest against this tree. V2 continued west post-impact, coming to rest off the roadway to the southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 37-year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point manual belt. The seat-mounted head and thorax side impact air bag deployed during the crash. V1 also contained an 18-year-old male right front occupant who was restrained by his available three-point lap and shoulder belt and was not injured. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
