Vehicle one (V1-case vehicle), a 2002 Nissan Altima 4-door sedan, was traveling in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan was traveling in the westbound lane of the same roadway and was approaching V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 2008 Toyota RAV4 SUV was traveling eastbound directly behind V1 (our case vehicle). It was daylight, the weather was clear and the bituminous roadway was dry. The crash occurred when V2 crossed into the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 noticed V2 beginning to cross the double yellow line and braked in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the collision. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2 head on. V2 then continued forward before traveling to its final resting position. After the initial impact, V1 was pushed backwards in a northwesterly direction. V3 was traveling eastbound behind V1 and tried to avoid the crash by braking and steering to the left but was unable to stop in time. The front of V3 impacted the rear right corner of V2 within the westbound travel lane. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling damage and V3 was driven from the scene by its owner. There were two occupants in our case vehicle: a 23 year old female driver and a 10 year old female in the front right passenger seat (case occupant). The driver was restrained by her lap and shoulder belt and her steering wheel mounted air bad did deploy as a result of the frontal impact. The 10 year old female (case occupant) was using her available lap belt but may have positioned the shoulder harness behind her. The available passenger front air bag (top IP mounted) did deploy as a result of the initial impact with V2. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital and then airlifted to a local level-one pediatric trauma center for treatment.
