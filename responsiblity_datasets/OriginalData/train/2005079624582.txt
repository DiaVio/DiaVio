This single-vehicle crash occurred at night on a weekend. The crash occurred on a dark, curved section of roadway in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was dry and free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Volvo S90 four-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the first lane of a two-lane, two-way, undivided, downhill (6.6% downhill slope), bituminous roadway, negotiating a right hand curve. V1 crossed the double solid yellow center stripe as it rounded the curve. The driver corrected right and crossed the northbound lane, departing the road over the right road edge. On the roadside, the front of V1 impacted a raised brick curb. V1 traversed a steep downhill embankment, and impacted a tree with its right front corner, swiping past the tree with contact along the right side. V1 became airborne and rotated clockwise over a steep drop, and frontally impacted a chain-link fence, which was mounted atop a cinder-block wall. The undercarriage of V1 contacted the top of the wall as V1 fell down the opposite side. On the other side of the wall was a short flat surface and then a cliff with a 9 meter (30-foot) drop. V1, moving backward, came to rest with its rear half overhanging the cliff. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The 19-year-old male driver of V1 reports that he has only been driving for four months. At the time of the crash, he was engaged in conversation with the two passengers, and music was playing in the car. He noticed that he had crossed into oncoming traffic when he saw headlights coming towards him. He turned the wheel to the right while braking, causing the vehicle to depart the road. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and is coded as a driver related factor: overcompensation.
