This case involves a small-overlap impact between the right-front end of a passenger car and a tree, which initiates a rollover. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the case vehicle. The case vehicle, a 2007 four-door Buick Lucerne was travelling in the westbound lane, with an adjacent parking lane, of a level, dry, asphalt divided trafficway. It was daylight and clear. The case vehicle drifted into the parking lane, drove over the curb and struck a large tree on the roadside with its front-end in a small-overlap mode. The impact caused the case vehicle to rollover two-quarter turns, left-side leading and rotate clockwise approximately 130 degrees before it came to rest in the westbound lane facing northeast. The restrained 40-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact air bags. The available seat-back mounted and side-roof rail mounted curtain air bags did not deploy. He was transported to a level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
