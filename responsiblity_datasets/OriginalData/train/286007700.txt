This case involves a severe frontal impact resulting in serious injuries to center rear-seated case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 four-door Hyundai Elantra sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway and vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford E350 Econoline commercial van, was traveling east in the eastbound lane. The road is inclined and has a right hand curve for the westbound traffic. The crash occurred during daylight hours in clear and dry weather. The crash occurred when V1 crossed the center line (double yellow line) into the path of V2. The frontal plane of V1 impacted the frontal plane of V2 in a offset frontal impact configuration. On impact, V1 was pushed backward by V2, rotated counterclockwise and impacted the north side embankment with its back plane before coming to final rest on the westbound roadway facing south. V2 came to final rest facing east in the eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case vehicle was driven by a 21-year-old male (non-case occupant) who was not using the available three-point seat belt. An 18-year-old male (non-case occupant) right-front passenger was not using the available three-point seat belt. Both frontal air bags deployed as a result of the crash. Both front seat occupants sustained moderate injuries and were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital. The 14-year-old female center-rear passenger (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt. She sustained serious injuries and was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
