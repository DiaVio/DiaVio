This frontal crash case involves a 6 year old female second row left side passenger, seated in a no-back booster seat, secured with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. She sustained serious injuries in the crash. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. In this area, the roadway is comprised of six east-west lanes that intersect with a roadway comprised of five lanes on the north side and two lanes on the south side. In the pre-crash area, the westbound lanes curve to the left. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Dodge Caravan minivan, was traveling west in lane two, and was negotiating the curve. The driver of V1 attempted to change lanes to the right but noticed another vehicle was already occupying that lane. He braked and steered left and traveled up onto a traffic island located on the northwest side of the intersection. V1 continued a short distance and the front of V1 impacted a pole, resulting in the deployment of the driver's seat belt buckle pretensioner and the deployment of both frontal air bags. V1 rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise and came to final rest on the traffic island, facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 6 year old female in the second row left seating position. She was seated in a no-back booster seat and was using the available manual lap/shoulder belt. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver of V1 was a 30 year old male who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt buckle pretensioner actuated and his steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deployed. He sustained minor injuries and his treatment status is unknown. There was an 8 year old male passenger in a no-back booster seat, secured with the available manual lap/shoulder belt in the second row right seating position. He sustained minor injuries and was treated and released at an outside hospital.
