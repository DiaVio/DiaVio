This case involves a centered frontal impact between the front of a SUV and a concrete pole. The unrestrained 52-year-old female driver is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer was southbound on a dry, level, asphalt, divided seven-lane traffic-way approaching a four-way intersection. Southbound traffic is accommodated by five lanes. The case vehicle was in the through lane adjacent to the outside right-turn lane. The case vehicle crossed through the inside through lane, both left turn lanes, drove over a mountable curb and struck a sign mounted on two wooden posts and concrete light pole with the front end and came to rest facing south-southeast. It was dark, but lighted and cloudy. The 52-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case occupant was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
