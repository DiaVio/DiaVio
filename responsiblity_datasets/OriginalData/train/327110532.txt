This case involves a severe frontal impact between the front of a SUV and the front of a 4x4 pick-up truck. The case occupant is the 46-year-old female driver of the SUV. She was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel and curtain air bags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2008 Chevrolet Suburban SUV was southbound lane of a dry, level, concrete, two-lane road, negotiating a left-sweeping curve approaching a four-leg intersection. Near the intersection, the southbound lane widens to include a right-turn lane. Vehicle two (V2) a 2008 Dodge 3500 4x4 pick-up, was northbound, negotiating a right-sweeping curve, approaching the same intersection. It was dark and cloudy. As V2 was approaching the intersection, it crossed the center-line, passed through the intersection and entered the southbound lane. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid a collision by steering right. The driver of V2, appears to have attempted to steer back into the northbound just before impact. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise approximately 180 degrees before it came to rest facing north in the southbound lane. V2 rotated clockwise approximately 160 degrees before it came to rest facing south-southeast in the northbound lane. The restrained 46-year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center, where she enrolled as a case occupant.
