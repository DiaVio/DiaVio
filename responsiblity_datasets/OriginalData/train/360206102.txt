The case occupant is a 28 year old male driver who was involved in a severe front end collision with another vehicle. This driver was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with frontal steering column mounted and knee bolster mounted air bag deployments and he sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the morning daylight hours with foggy weather and dry roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of one east and one westbound asphalt travel lane, with paved shoulders on both sides of the roadway. The travel lanes are straight with an uphill grade for westbound vehicles and a downhill grade for eastbound vehicles. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Toyota 4-Runner four door compact utility vehicle, was traveling west in the westbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2010 Ford F150 FX4 four door crew cab large pickup truck, was traveling east in the eastbound lane. There was a non-contact vehicle slowing and stopping just ahead of V2 in the eastbound to make a left turn into a driveway on the north side of the street. In an attempt to avoid striking the non-contact vehicle, the driver of V2 braked and swerved to the left. V2 crossed the center lane lines, traveled into the westbound lane and the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. Both vehicles remained in contact at final rest. V1 stayed in the lane facing west, and V2 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest with the majority of the vehicle still in the westbound travel lane, facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 28 year old male driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with actuation of the belt pretensioners. The driver's frontal steering column mounted and lower instrument panel mounted knee bolster air bags deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
