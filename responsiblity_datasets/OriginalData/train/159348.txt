Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Saturn LW200, 4-door station wagon was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road and was negotiating a right curve. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Chevrolet Venture, 4-door minivan was traveling south in the southbound lane and negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, cloudy and the bituminous road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 drifted left, crossed the centerline, and into the path of V2. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal configuration (67% vehicle overlap for V1). V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees and came to rest in the middle of the road facing west-southwest. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 120 degrees and came to rest off the west side of the road facing east-northeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The driver of V2 was pronounced dead at the scene and transported to the morgue. The 23-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
