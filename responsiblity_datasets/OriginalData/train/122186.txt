Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Acura 3.2 TL, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 was negotiating a left curve in the road when he drifted off the right side of the paved surface and his right wheels entered the gravel shoulder. The driver steered to the left and re-entered the travel lanes but began a counter-clockwise yaw. V1 crossed the centerline, the eastbound lane, and departed the left side of the road. The right fender of V1 struck and knocked down a bush/shrub before striking a 20-cm diameter tree with the right quarter panel. This impact stopped the counter-clockwise rotation and caused the vehicle to begin a clockwise rotation and become slightly airborne as it disengaged with the tree. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 40 degrees and was in a slight pitch when it struck a 36-cm diameter tree with the left side. V1 then returned to a counter-clockwise rotation, disengaged from the tree and fell back to ground level facing south-southeast. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 22-year-old male driver (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel and the seat-mounted air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. The 27-year-old male center-rear passenger (non-case occupant) was not using the avialable three-point seat belt, was completely ejected out of the right-rear door, and was found partially underneath the case vehicle at final rest. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries (ISS-17) including pulmonary contusions, forearm fractures, and spinal fractures.
