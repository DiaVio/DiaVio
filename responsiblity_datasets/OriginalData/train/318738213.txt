This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 50-year-old male belted driver with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant was driving a full size sedan when it was involved in an offset frontal collision with a large pickup truck. The case vehicle was severely damaged; the case occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred late afternoon on a dry road in clear conditions. A 2008 Nissan Altima full size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling south on a bituminous three-lane rural road negotiating a left curve and approaching a three-way intersection. The road grade was level in all directions. A 2001 Ford F-250 large pickup (Vehicle 2) was stopped facing north waiting to turn left at the intersection. A 2001 Ford Focus compact sedan (Vehicle 3) was traveling north negotiating the curve in the opposite direction and approaching the same intersection. There were no traffic controls for the three vehicles; the cross street was controlled by stop signs. The driver of V3 rear-ended V2 (Event 1). V2 was pushed forward and left into V1's oncoming lane of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on in an offset frontal configuration (Event 2). All three vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 50-year-old male driver. He was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by loading to the D-ring and belt webbing. The status of the retractor pretensioner was indeterminate due to belt removal by rescue, but the right passenger retractor pretensioner was actuated. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The steering wheel hub airbag, left curtain, and left outboard seatback airbag deployed in the crash. The available right instrument panel airbag, right curtain, and right outboard seatback airbag did not deploy. There were no other airbags installed in this vehicle. This occupant was transported by air to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
