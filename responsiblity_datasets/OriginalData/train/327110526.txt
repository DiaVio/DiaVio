This case involves a moderate impact between the front-end of a passenger car and a utility pole. The case occupant is the 24-year-old male driver. The 29-year-old female right-front passenger is also a case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2008, four-door, Chevrolet Impala was westbound in the right-turn lane of a snowy/slushy, level, concrete, three-lane road approaching a controlled, four-leg intersection. It was dark, but lighted and freezing rain was falling. For traffic proceeding westbound beyond the intersection, the roadway narrows to one through lane. Traffic controls were present at the intersection. The case vehicle passed through the intersection and departed the road at the northwest corner, struck a utility pole, rotated clockwise and came to rest facing northwest, straddling the road side and the roadway. The case vehicle was towed due to damage. The 24-year-old male driver and the 29-year-old female, right-front passenger were the sole occupants of the vehicle. Neither was restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel and top instrument-panel air bags deployed. Both were taken to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as case occupants.
