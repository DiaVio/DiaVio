The crash occurred on a curve in the westbound lane of a two-lane road divided by double yellow lines. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph), but at the point of impact, there was an advisory speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Both lanes were tree lined with a one-half meter high embankment along the north side of the westbound lane. At the point of impact, the westbound lane was uphill with a 6 percent grade. Weekend afternoon traffic was light at the time with wet roads and rain.

V1, a 1997 Toyota Four-Runner SUV, was driven by a 33 year-old female. The driver stated that she had just left the store and was traveling home in the westbound lane at a rate of 40 kmph (25 mph). As she was negotiating the right curve, the rear of her vehicle began a clockwise skid. Panicking, the driver attempted to counter the spin by braking hard and over steering left. The vehicle spun clockwise 45 degrees before departing the road to the right and impacting a tree with the front right portion of V1. V1 continued to rotate clockwise 180 degrees before crashing the left rear portion of V1 into another tree on the right roadside. After the second collision, V1 continued to rotate clockwise approximately 100 degrees, crossing over both lanes before coming to rest partially off the road on the left, facing south. The driver was not transported for injuries but her leg was treated on scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was "Decision error, too fast for curve/turn." Associated factors include the wet roadway and the weather (rain).
