Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Honda Civic, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road and was approaching a 3-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Mercury Cougar, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same road and was approaching the same intersection but from the opposite direction. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road was wet. The driver of V2 attempted to turn left at the intersection and entered V1's path of travel. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique, offset manner. Both vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 56-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel and seat-mounted airbags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
