This crash involved two restrained males, a 19 year old driver and a 17 year old passenger of a 2011 Toyota Sienna minivan (V1). The right front passenger is our case subject. He was restrained by the available three point manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag and a right side head curtain airbag. The seat mounted side impact airbag did not deploy. The driver had deployed frontal and knee airbags available to him. The crash occurred at night on a dark unlit two lane roadway at a T- intersection. The roadway was level and curved to the right and was controlled by traffic signals. V1 was traveling south on the two lane roadway attempting to turn left onto the intersecting roadway. Just prior to the intersection V1's right side tires dropped off the west road edge. As V1 turned left, it began to skid in a slight counterclockwise yaw and departed the right side of the road. The right front quarter panel of V1 impacted a traffic light pole and continued forward and into an electrical box mounted high on the same pole. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and impacted the same pole with the right front passenger door. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The right front passenger was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center due to the serious nature of his injuries.
