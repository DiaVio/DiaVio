This case involved a 59 year old unrestrained female front right passenger of a 2010 Mazda 3 four-door sedan (V1). She was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt, but did have a deployed frontal airbag. The driver of V1 was a 41 year old female who was also unrestrained with an airbag deployment. V1 was traveling in the southbound lane when it drove off the right road edge and crossed a private driveway. V1 struck a plastic mailbox pole with its frontal plane, breaking the pole and knocking the mailbox to the ground. V1 continued traveling forward for approximately 35 meters and impacted a 40cm tree, completely uprooting the tree. V1 rotated 80 degrees counterclockwise and came to final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The front right passenger of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center due to the severity of her injuries. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital emergency department for treatment. The driver was released later the same day.
