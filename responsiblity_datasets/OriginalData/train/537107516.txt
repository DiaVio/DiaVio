Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Dodge Caravan, minivan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way urban roadway. It was dark, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 reported that he fell asleep as his vehicle was entering a left curve. V1 departed the right side of the road, crossed a small commercial parking lot, and struck a 20-cm diameter tree with the right-portion of the front bumper. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 36-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
