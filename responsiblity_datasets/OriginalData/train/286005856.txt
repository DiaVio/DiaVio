This case involves a rollover arrested by a roof impact with a utility pole resulting in critical injuries to the right front passenger (case occupant). The crash occurred during daylight in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two-lane bituminous roadway basically straight in origin and without traffic control device involvement. The roadway is uphill and separated by a solid yellow line. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 four-door Volvo S40 passenger sedan, was being driven northbound. The crash occurred when the driver lost control of V1, which caused V1 to cross the centerline and southbound lane and subsequently depart the roadway. The front undercarriage of V1 impacted an embankment which initiated a right-side leading rollover. The rollover was arrested after one quarter turn by a roof impact with a utility pole. The utility pole fractured resulting in a final rest position of V1 on its roof, engaged with the broken utility pole and embankment. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by an 18 year old female who was not belted at the time of the crash. There were three other occupants in V1 including a 16 year old female in the right front seat (case occupant), a 17 year old female in the left rear seat, and a 16 year old female in the right rear seat, all of whom were using the available lap and shoulder belts. All occupants were transported to the nearest hospital by ground unit. The driver sustained serious injuries and the rear seat passengers sustained minor injuries. The case occupant sustained critical injuries and was subsequently transferred to a trauma center by flight unit.
