This case involves a sideswipe impact with another passenger car, followed by the primary sideswipe impact between the left side of the case vehicle and a tree. The case vehicle a 2014, four-door Mercedes CLS 63 AMG, was eastbound in the outside lane of a dry, five-lane, concrete, divided trafficway. It was daylight and clear. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Buick Century was eastbound in the inside lane of the same roadway. The case vehicle attempted to merge into the inside lane, but it struck the right side of V2, entered a counterclockwise yaw, departed the roadway off the north side and struck a curb with its left front wheel, entered the raised median, struck a tree with its left side, rotated into the westbound travel lanes and came to rest facing northeast straddling the westbound travel lanes. After impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing southwest, straddling the median and the outside eastbound lane. The restrained 39-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact, knee bolster, seat-back mounted and roof side rail air bags. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
