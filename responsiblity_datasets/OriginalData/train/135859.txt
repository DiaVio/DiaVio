Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Ford Freestyle, minivan that had been adapted for a wheelchair driver, was traveling south in the right southbound lane of a six-lane divided, limited access freeway (three lanes northbound, unprotected median, three lanes southbound). Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2005 Volvo VNL, tractor pulling one trailer was parked on the right southbound shoulder. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep, relinquished control of V1 and drifted to the right. V1 departed the right lane edge and the frontal plane of V1 struck and underrode the left-rear corner of V2s trailer. V1 drove past/through this impact and came to rest on the right shoulder in front of V2, facing south-southwest. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. V2 was reportedly driven from the scene. The 39-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) who was a paraplegic was seated in a power wheelchair that was docked in a wheelchair docking system, was restrained by a 2-point lap belt that was attached to the wheelchair, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with critical (AIS-5) injuries.
