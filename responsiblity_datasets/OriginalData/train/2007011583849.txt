The single vehicle, weekday, early afternoon crash occurred on the inside shoulder of the two eastbound lanes of a 4 lane, straight, level, bituminous interstate roadway. At the time of the crash it was daylight, clear and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit was 113 kmph (70 mph).

V1, a 2006 Chevrolet Equinox solely occupied by a 42 year-old driver, was eastbound in lane one of the roadway described above. V1 exited the roadway to the right and traveled about 90 meters in a grassy area between the shoulder and ditch before re-entering the roadway. V1 went from lane one into lane 2 where the driver over-corrected to the right causing V1 to trip and roll left 8 quarter turns. V1 came to rest on its wheels on the inside shoulder facing west-southwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver stated that he was on a business trip doing about 65 mph in lane one. He was talking on a cell phone and had drifted onto the shoulder twice before. He was talking to the hotel where he was to spend the night and was reaching for a pencil to write down directions when he drifted off the road a third time. He came back onto the road, crossed both lanes, overcorrected and then rolled over. He was from out of state and drives this way infrequently.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side". The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was the recognition error of internal distraction. Some associated factors on the part of V1 include the driver's use of alcohol, his use of a cell phone and trying to take directions at the same time as driving and his poor directional control. He was also unfamiliar with the roadway and some of his tires were worn to minimal tread limits.
