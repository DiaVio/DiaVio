This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 59-year old, male driver with deployed air bags. He sustained serious injuries in a frontal crash with a tree. The crash occurred mid-afternoon in dry, cloudy weather. A 2006 Toyota Scion tc 2-door hatchback (v1) was negotiating a left curve on a rural, bituminous, two-lane roadway heading northeast. The grade was slightly downhill at 2%. As v1 negotiated the left curve, it traveled partially off the roadway to the right. V1 then re-entered the roadway, crossed both travel lanes and departed the left side. V1 impacted a tree (2.5 ft diameter) with its front plane and subsequently rotated clockwise 90 degrees, coming to rest in a yard off the west roadside. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 59-year old male case occupant who was restrained by lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The steering wheel and knee bolster airbags deployed as a result of impact. The available seat back and curtain airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance.
