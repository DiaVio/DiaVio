The crash occurred on a straight, bituminous, 5 lane roadway with an upward 6% slope, with a posted speed limit of 56 kph (35mph). Conditions were clear on the weekday afternoon.

V1, a 1996 Mercury Tracer driven by a 51 year-old female, was traveling eastbound in the right curb lane between 30-45mph. The driver of V1 had not been feeling well the day before and went to bed at 1800 hours, then woke up the day of the crash feeling better. Throughout the morning, however, the driver again began "to not feel right; sleepy, tired and thirsty". After driving for about 10 minutes, she decided to return home and continued for 15 minutes in that direction, to take prescribed insulin for her diabetic condition, and additional daily medications for high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which she had not taken since the prior morning. As the driver of V1 approached an intersection with vehicles backed up and stopped at a red traffic signal, the driver lost consciousness, and the front of V1 struck the back of V2 in lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V2, a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, driven by a 25 year-old male, had been stopped for 10-15 seconds at the red light, and had just accelerated to 10mph when the signal turned to green, as V1 struck V2. The driver of V2 had been looking straight ahead prior to the impact and had no chance to avoid the crash. The driver continued to look ahead after the impact and successfully avoided contacting the vehicle in front of him. V2 came to rest at an angle to the right against the right hand curb. V2 was drivable following the crash and the driver denied any injuries.
