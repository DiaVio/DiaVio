This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 16-year-old male belted driver with non-deployed airbags, a 41-year-old right front male belted passenger with non-deployed airbags, and a 14-year-old left rear male unbelted passenger. The driver suffered critical injuries. The right front and left rear occupants sustained moderate injuries. There was also a 14-year old middle rear male passenger and a 13-year-old right rear male passenger. This vehicle was involved in an offset frontal impact with a large tree. The crash occurred just after dawn on a wet roadway in blowing snow. A 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was negotiating a right curve on a two-way, two-lane suburban bituminous road heading southwest. There was a 2% downhill grade. As V1 negotiated the right curve, it traveled left across the center line and departed the left side of the road. V1 traveled approximately 50 meters through a yard before impacting a tree with its front left plane. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 16-year-old male case occupant. He was belted by a lap and shoulder belt. No pretensioners were installed and the available airbags did not deploy. He was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance where he was diagnosed with critical injuries. The right front seat was occupied by a 41-year-old male case occupant. He was also belted with no pretensioners or airbag deployment. He was transported to a local trauma center with moderate injuries. The second row left seat was occupied by a 14-year-old male case occupant. He was unbelted with no airbag available. He was transported to a local trauma center with moderate injuries.
