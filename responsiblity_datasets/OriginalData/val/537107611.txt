Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Mazda 626, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the right westbound through-lane of a three-lane, two-way roadway (right westbound lane for right turns and through traffic, left westbound lane for left turn only, and one eastbound lane) and was approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Ford Econoline, cargo van was traveling east in the left eastbound lane (left turn lane) and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V2 began a left turn at the interesection but crossed the path of V1. The driver of V1 braked but was unable to avoid striking V2. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in an oblique L-type configuration. V2 rotated clockwise approximately 90 degrees and came to rest in the northwest corner of the intersection facing east-southeast. V2 rotated clockwise approximately 150 degrees and came to rest in the middle of the east-west road, in the west half of the intersection, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 34-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seatbelt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 16-month-old male right-rear passenger (case occupant) was reportedly seated in a forward-facing child seat that was secured to the vehicle using the available three-point seat belt but the child was improperly or not secured to the child seat. The driver of V1 refused medical treatment and the case occupant was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
