Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck, was traveling west on a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, dark conditions. A deer entered the roadway and V1 steered right and started braking with lockup. V1 departed the road to the right, where it struck a stone fence with its front. After striking the fence, V1 continued west off the roadway where it struck a large tree with its front. The driver of V1 and case study occupant, a 59-year-old male, was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
