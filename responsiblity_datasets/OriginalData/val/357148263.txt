The 173 cm, 78 kg (5'8", 173 lbs), 18-year-old male right front passenger in the 2005 2-door Chevrolet Cobalt was restrained by a three-point belt and the instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed. During the severe, 2 o'clock, right side (near side) impact with the pole he moved outboard relative to the vehicle interior. The fractures to the right and left temporal bone, frontal bone, right orbital plate, ethmoid bone, left sphenoid bone, left parietal bone with exposed brain, the subarachnoid hemorrhage, the subdural hemorrhage, the duret hemorrhages and the cerebral lacerations were probably due to direct contact with the intruding pole but possibly due to contact with the right roof side rail. The right frontal scalp laceration, the right eyelid contusion, the lip contusions and the right cheek abrasions were also probably due to contact with the intruding pole. The right femur fracture, the right pelvic fractures, the inferior vena cava laceration and the right iliac vein laceration were all probably due to contact with the rear lower quadrant of the right front door. The central chest contusions, the right abdomen contusion, the scrotum contusion, the right thigh abrasion and the right calf contusion were also probably due to contact with the right front door. The left upper arm and shoulder abrasions, the left ventral forearm abrasions, the left hand abrasions, the bilateral knee contusions and the left hip abrasion are all from an unknown source.
