North of the intersection there were three southbound lanes and two northbound lanes. South of the intersection there were three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. East and west of the intersection there were two two-lane undivided roads with one lane in each direction. East of the intersection to road curved to the left with a radius of curvature of 41m. West of the intersection the road curved to the right with a radius of curvature of 58m. The roads were all dry, asphalt and level. The posted speed limits were 89kmph/55mph for north/southbound traffic and 48kmph/30mph for east/westbound traffic. There were no traffic controls for north/southbound traffic. There were stop signs for east and westbound traffic and there was a yield sign in the median crossover for westbound traffic. The crash happened on a weekday afternoon while traffic was light under clear skies. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1, a 2000 Ford Explorer four-door SUV with one occupant was westbound in lane one. V2, a 1996 Chevy Corsica four-door with one occupant was southbound in lane one. V3, a 1993 Jeep Cherokee four-door SUV with two occupants was stopped eastbound in lane one. V1 travelled across the northbound lanes, the median and was traveling westbound across the southbound lanes and the path of V2, when its right side was struck by the front of V2 (Event 1), which braked without lockup prior to impact. The impact caused V1 to roll longitudinally one-quarter turn onto its left side (Event 2) as it rotated in a clockwise direction and skidded toward V3. The top left back of V1 struck the front left corner of V3 (Event 3), which took no evasive action. V1 came to rest on its left side facing northwest about 9m southwest of the first impact. V2 had already been moved but according to police came to rest facing west just west of the impact point. V3 had already left the scene prior to researcher arrival. V1 and V2 were both towed from the scene.

V1, the Ford Explorer, was driven by a 30-year old female who was not injured. The driver had left the scene prior to researcher arrival and refused to return numerous phone calls and messages left by the researcher and a letter hand-delivered to her home my the researcher. According to the driver of V3, who had a clear and unobstructed view of both V1 and V2's approaches, V1 was traveling eastbound and did not stop at the stop sign east of the intersection or at the yield sign in the median before she started to cross the southbound lanes and the driver did not appear to take any evasive action prior to impact. She added that V1 was on it's left side when its top struck V3.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling crossing through the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was driver related, unknown recognition error, due to the fact that the driver would not grant an interview. Associated factors were assigned to V1 for the same reason.

V2, the Chevy Corsica, was driven by a 40-year old male who was not injured. The driver reported that he was traveling at the speed limit in lane one while returning home from a friend's house. He said he did not see V1 crossing from his left to right in front of him until just a second before his vehicle struck hers He added that he did brake in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid impact.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded for this vehicle. An associated factor was assigned to V2 for driver behavior, recognition, inadequate surveillance - failure to look far enough ahead.

V3, the Jeep Cherokee, was driven by a 27-year old female who was not injured. The driver reported that she had just left the store behind her and had stopped at the eastbound stop sign and was waiting to enter the crossover and turn left as she returned to her home. The driver of V3 said she had a clear and unobstructed view of both V1 and V2's approaches, She added that V1 was traveling eastbound and did not stop at the stop sign east of the intersection or at the yield sign in the median before she started to cross the southbound lanes and the path of V2. She said the driver of V1 did not appear to take any evasive action prior to impact. She added that V1 was on its left side when its top struck hers and she never moved.

The Critical Precrash Event and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event were not coded for V3 because it was not involved in the first harmful event. An associated factor was assigned to V3 due only to presence for other, vehicle - over-sized tires.
