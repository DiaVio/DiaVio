This case involves a passenger car that collided with a compact SUV in full-frontal mode. The case occupant is the driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2009 Pontiac Vibe, four-door hatchback, was southbound on a dry, asphalt, two-lane roadway, on a downgrade. Vehicle two (V2), a 2014 Ford Escape 4x4 compact SUV was northbound on the same roadway. The case vehicle drifted across the center-line and entered the path of V2. The vehicles collided in a frontal mode. As a consequence of the impact, both vehicles rotated counterclockwise. V2 rotated off the roadway onto the down sloping roadside and came to rest facing west. The case vehicle came to rest in the northbound lane with its rear wheels straddling the center-line facing east-southeast. It was daylight and clear. The restrained 61-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed steering-wheel mounted, frontal-impact and roof side-rail mounted and curtain side-impact air bags. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
