Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 76-year old, male driver, of a 2002 Volvo V70 station wagon, which was primarily involved in a far side collision with the frontal plane of a 2003 Ford E-350 cutaway van. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of a winter weekday, at the intersection of a north/south trafficway and a two-lane east/west roadway. The north/south trafficway is straight and composed of four northbound lanes and three southbound lanes, separated by a grassy median. The two-lane east/west roadway intersects the north/south trafficway on the east side only. The north/south trafficway is straight with a posted speed limit of 40 mph (64 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle 1, the 2002 Volvo V70 station wagon, was traveling southbound, in the left turn lane, approaching the intersection from the north. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. Reportedly, a family pet (dog) was occupying the right front seating area. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to turn left at the intersection and continue traveling eastbound. Vehicle 2, a 2003 Ford E-350 cutaway van (incomplete vehicle, greater than 4536 kgs GVWR), was traveling northbound, in the right northbound through lane, approaching the intersection from the south. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling north. Crash: Both Vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the right side plane of Vehicle 1 in a "t-bone" type impact configuration. Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise out of the impact and its right side plane (right front) contacted the right side plane of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 1 subsequently departed the east side of the trafficway and came to rest, facing south, after striking a sign post with its back plane (back right). Vehicle 1 is believed to have come to rest, in the northbound roadway, facing a northeasterly direction, just north of the intersection. As a result of the first impact, Vehicle 1's right side curtain and right front seat back mounted, side air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
