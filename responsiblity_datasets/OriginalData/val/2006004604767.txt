The crash occurred in the center of a four-way intersection composed of a two-lane north/southbound roadway, and a two-lane east/westbound roadway. All roadways were bituminous and level with posted speed limits of 80 kmph (50 mph). The north/southbound roadway was controlled by stop signs on each corner. It was early morning on a weekday. The roads were dry and the sky was cloudy. Traffic flow was light.

V1, a 1999 Nissan Frontier with one occupant, was traveling north when it attempted to turn left at the intersection after observing the stop sign and struck V2 on the right side. V2, a 2004 International Model 4300 Box Truck with one occupant, was traveling east. V2 had completed his morning deliveries and was therefore carrying no cargo. As V2 passed through the intersection it was struck by V1 on the right side. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1, driven by a 71-year-old male who reported a complaint of pain in the chest and was transported, stated that he travels this route one month out of the year during hunting season. Driver stated that he stopped at the stop sign, and looking left he observed V2. He then looked right waiting for an opening in traffic. When an opening presented itself, the driver attempted his left turn without looking to his left again to see if it was still safe to proceed. V1 turned directly into the path of V2, striking V2 on the right side. V1 made no avoidance maneuver.
