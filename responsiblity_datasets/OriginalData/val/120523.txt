The case occupant is the 152 cm, 47 kg (5 ft 0 in, 104 lb), 16-year-old female driver of a 2004 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan. The case vehicle was struck in the right-side by the front of a 2005 Dodge Durango, 4-door utility vehicle when the driver lost control, and the Saturn entered a counter clockwise rotation crossing the centerline of a two-lane road. The impact was classified as severe. The WinSMASH reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 52 kmph (32 mph), which appeared to be consistent with the observed vehicle damage. The case occupant was using the available three-point seat belt. No air bags deployed at her seating location.



In response to the 3 o'clock direction of force (80 degrees), she moved to her right, relative to the vehicle interior. She sustained a posterior fracture of the right #11 rib with pneumothorax and a liver laceration from contact with the center console. She also sustained a diffuse axonal injury, bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages in the cerebrum, brain edema, and a loss of consciousness with neurological deficit from contact with the beltline of the right-front interior door. She died as a result of her injuries.
