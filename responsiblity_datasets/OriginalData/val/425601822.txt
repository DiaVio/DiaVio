This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 45-year-old male belted driver with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant was driving a compact utility vehicle when he sustained severe injuries in a frontal crash with an intermediate size sedan. The crash occurred during midevening hours on a dry and unlit road in the dark. A 2012 Kia Sorento compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was traveling west on a two-way, two-lane suburban road with a 3% uphill grade. A 2003 Honda Accord intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) was traveling east in the opposite direction of V1 on a 5% downhill grade. Both vehicles were negotiating a curve with 8% superelevation. As V1 continued negotiating a right curve in its direction of travel, V2 began a longitudinal skid and traveled left over the center line. The two vehicles collided head-on (Event 1). V2 rotated counterclockwise around the front left fender of V1, leaving a moderate sideswipe damage pattern to V1's left front fender, driver's door, and upper A-pillar. After impact V1 was pushed back while rotating clockwise, coming to rest on the north roadside. V2 continued rotating 150 degrees from impact, coming to rest on the north shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was operated by a 45-year-old male driver. He was belted with actuated retractor and anchor pretensioners. No buckle pretensioner was installed. The steering wheel hub, top right instrument panel, both curtains, and both front outboard seatback airbags deployed during the collision. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of severe injuries. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 12-year-old male belted front right passenger with deployed front and side airbags. He was reported to have minor injuries by police and was transported to a local hospital for treatment. There was a fatality in the opposing vehicle.
