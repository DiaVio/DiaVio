This case involves an impact between the front of a SUV and a pier supporting a bridge. The 52-year-old male driver is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2010 Mercury Mountaineer SUV was northbound on a down-grade, on a dry, asphalt, divided five-lane traffic-way, without pavement markings to delineate travel lanes, approaching a three-leg intersection. As the vehicle passed through the intersection, it crossed the centerline and mounted a barrier curb and the front of the case vehicle struck a roadside bridge pier. It was dark, but lighted and cloudy. After impact the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise off the pier, swiped a second pier at the right front door and came to rest facing south-southeast in the southbound lane. The 52-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case occupant was transported to a level-one trauma center with multiple moderate injuries to multiple body regions and enrolled as a case occupant.
