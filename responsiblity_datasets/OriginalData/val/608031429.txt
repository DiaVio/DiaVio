The case vehicle a 4-door 2001 Chrysler Concorde was in the inside west-bound lane of a level, four-lane asphalt roadway approaching a gentle 'S'-curve. It was dark, but lighted, the roadway was dry and there was no adverse weather. The case vehicle failed to negotiate the left-sweeping curve, departed the roadway over a barrier curb and struck a wooden light-pole with its front end. The impact sheared the pole. The case vehicle traversed an asphalt walkway, and entered a public golf course. As the case vehicle traversed the down grade of a slope it began to rotate clockwise. It came to rest along the line of a river bank facing east. The sole occupant was the 57-year-old male driver. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center. The case vehicle was towed due to damage.
