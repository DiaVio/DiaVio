The posted speed limit for the area is 89 kmph (55 mph) with an advisory speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) for the curve. There are warning signs present for the curve and downhill elevation as well as Chevron signs along the left roadside indicating a continuous right curve.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Mazda Miata, was southbound in the #1 lane negotiating the right hand curve when the driver lost control and the vehicle began to rotate clockwise as it crossed both lanes to the left. V1 departed the #2 lane and with its rear left side contacted the guardrail and posts for a distance of approximately 12 meters (39 feet). V1 then rotated counter-clockwise and contacted the guardrail with its front plane. The vehicle continued to rotate counter-clockwise back across both southbound lanes and came to rest in a dirt pullout on the right side of the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage and the driver, the only occupant, was transported to a medical facility but refused treatment and left against medical advice.
