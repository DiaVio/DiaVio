The crash occurred on a bituminous two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 89 KPH (55 MPH). The roadway curved to the left with a radius of curvature of 625 meters and a superelevation of 1.8% and a -2.8% grade for V1. There was a black on yellow intersection warning sign for V1. The roadway had a grade of 3.2% for V2. The weather was clear, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekend afternoon crash. Traffic flow was heavy for that time of day.

V1, a 2007 Acura MDX, was traveling west on the roadway negotiating the curve to the left on a downgrade and approaching a “T” intersection to the left. V2, a 2008 Land Rover L2, was traveling east on the same roadway with an upgrade approaching the same intersection. V1 turned left and was struck on the right side by the front of V1. V1 continued a short distance onto the intersecting road and came to rest facing in a southerly direction. V2 came to rest in the eastbound lane facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1, the Acura MDX, was driven by a belted 51-year-old male who was not injured. The belted 50-year-old male right front seat passenger, the belted 46 and 48-year-old female second right and left seat passengers and the belted 13 year old right third seat passenger were not injured. The right front side seat air bag and right side curtain air bag deployed. There was no further information obtained from operator of V1 because no one in the vehicle spoke English.

A witness behind V1 stated that it appeared that “the operator of V1 apparently just decided to turn left.” He stated that he was going very slowly as he made the turn and almost looked as if he was going to stop in the middle of the intersection. Traffic was heavy that day due to all the “leaf peepers” from out of the area. He also indicated that he did not remember seeing any signal indicating the turn, but could not be absolutely sure. He stated that V2 did not have enough room or time to stop to avoid the collision.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an unknown type of driver error. This was chosen because it is possible he was distracted by his passengers, could have been lost since they were from out of the area or may have looked, but did not see the other vehicle.

V1, the Land Rover L2, was driven by a belted 31-year-old male who was not injured, however, was evaluated at the scene by EMS personnel. He stated that he was returning to a friend's house in town after rock climbing for approximately 3 ½ hours that day. He was traveling 30-35 mph and not in a hurry. He advised that he saw the other vehicle coming in the opposite direction as he approached the intersection and then it suddenly turned in front of him. He said he did not see any blinker indicating the turn. He braked and steered left in an attempt to avoid the collision but was unsuccessful. He considered himself in good health, took no medications and wore contact lenses for both hyperopic (far-sighted) and myopic (near-sighted) conditions.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction over the left lane line. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. The police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.
