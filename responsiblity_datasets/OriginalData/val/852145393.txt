This near-side impact crash involves a 55 year old restrained male seated in the front right position with side air bag deployments who sustained serious lower extremity injuries. This crash occurred at an intersection during the evening hours at night with street lights. The bituminus surface was icy and it was snowing at the time of the crash. Stop signs controlled the east and west directions and no traffic controls for the southbound traffic lane that became a one way street to the south after this intersection. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Mercedes E320 four door sedan, was traveling westbound in lane two of a three lane, two way street and crossing straight through the intersection. Vehicle two (V2) was a 1998 International 4900 fire truck that was traveling in the southbound lane of a two lane, two way street and also proceeding through the intersection straight. The front left of V2 impacted the right side front of V1 in the intersection. V1 then rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees, and the right side back quarter panel of V1 impacted with the left side of V2. V1 then continued south of the intersection and came to final rest facing south across the two southbound one way lanes. V2 post impact veered slightly to the right and came to final rest facing mainly south in the middle of the intersection. V1 was towed due to damage and V2 was driven away. The case occupant was seated in the front right seat using the manual lap/shoulder belt with the seatbelt pretensioners actuating and both side impact air bags deployed (door mounted and roof side rail). This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital before being transported to the trauma center. Other occupants in the case vehicle included the driver and three passengers in the second row who all sustained minor injuries. The 42 year old female driver was lap/shoulder belt restrained with the seatbelt pre-tensioners actuating. A 66 year female was seated in the second row left, a 7 year old male was seated in the second row middle, and 23 year old female was seated in the second row right. All three back seat passengers were using the manual lap/shoulder belts.
