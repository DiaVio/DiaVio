Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Pontiac Grand Am SE, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was approaching a 4-leg intersection controlled by a stop sign and overhead flashing red light. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Chevrolet G30, 1-ton cargo van pulling a utility trailer was traveling north in the left northbound through-lane of the intersecting 4-lane roadway (northbound right-turn lane, northbound through-lane, two southbound lanes) which is controlled by a yellow-flashing overhead light. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 stopped at the intersection and then proceeded to cross the intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage, but V2 was driven from the scene. The 21-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
