This single-vehicle rollover crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane asphalt roadway. The southbound lane is straight and slightly downhill in the area of the crash. The speed limit is 88 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred during the afternoon on a weekend with no adverse weather or road conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Ford F-150 was southbound following two non-contact vehicles. V1 accelerated and steered into the northbound lane with the intention of overtaking and passing the non-contact vehicles in a legal passing zone. As V1 was traveling in the northbound lane, its left side tires departed the left edge of the roadway. V1 steered right and returned to the northbound lane. V1 then returned to the southbound lane in front of the non-contact vehicles, steered left and began to rotate counter-clockwise. The right-rear tire departed the road edge as the vehicle continued to rotate counter-clockwise. V1 then crossed the southbound lane to the left with its right side leading where it tripped, flipped, slid and rolled across the northbound lane to the left and departed the road edge. V1 came to rest on the roadside on its wheels facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 101 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a seventeen-year-old male, was traveling with a seventeen-year-old friend and had traveled a distance of approximately 161 kilometers (100 miles) when the crash occurred, according to the police report. The father of the driver refused to allow his son to be interviewed because of pending charges against the driver for possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, DUI drugs and endangerment.

Witnesses in the non-contact vehicles stated V1 was traveling at approximately 128 kmph (80 mph) while trying to pass them. Both witnesses stated that they thought the driver just lost control after returning to the southbound lane.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the left side of travel lane. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was attributed to V1 and was coded as a driver related factor: poor directional control. Aggressive driving, overcompensation and driver inexperience were contributing factors for this driver.
