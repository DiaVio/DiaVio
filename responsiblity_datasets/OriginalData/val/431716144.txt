This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 33 year old male front right passenger of a 2012 Subaru Outback 4-door wagon. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions, (seat back mounted) side air bags for the front outboard seating positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions. The right front side air bag and right curtain air bag deployed as a result of an oblique angled impact with a 2006 Ford E350 Super Duty full size van (Vehicle 2). The crash occurred within an urban 4-leg intersection. The north/south trafficway consisted of 9 asphalt (level) travel lanes, divided by a raised curb median, with a posted speed limit of 45 mph (72 km/h). The east/west trafficway consisted of 7 asphalt (level) travel lanes also divided by a raised curb median, with a posted speed limit of 35 mph (56 km/h). Traffic through the intersection was controlled by overhead tri-lights. It was dark; with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 1 was westbound on the inboard travel lane and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was southbound in the outboard through lane and proceeding straight. As both vehicles entered the intersection, the right side surface of Vehicle 1 was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2 (event 1). The impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. At this point, both vehicles were re-directed towards the southwest sector of the intersection. The front right area of Vehicle 1 subsequently struck an orange traffic barrel resulting in minor damage (event 2). Both vehicles came to rest in the southwest sector of the intersection facing southwest. The restrained 33 year old male front right passenger of Vehicle 1 was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-rear track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the front right 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At impact 1, the passenger initiated a lateral (and slightly forward) trajectory in response to the 3 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual restraint, deployed right front side air bag, right curtain air bag, and door interior surface. Interaction with the deployed right front side air bag was evidenced by the broad scuff mark identified on the inboard surface of the membrane. It should be noted that the air bag deployment was impeded by intrusion of the right B-pillar against the seat back. A smudge mark documented on the inboard surface of the deployed curtain air bag was attributed to possible head interaction. Scuff marks and indentations found on the right front door interior surface was indicative of passenger right lower extremity and pelvic engagement. Displacement (and scuff marks) identified on the center console suggested that the passenger may have been compressed against the intruded right front door. This "vise" mechanism was compounded by separation of the right front door hinges which allowed further intrusion of this component. The second event was minor in nature and produced little if no kinematic response from the occupant. Following the collision, the restrained (unknown aged) female driver, restrained 33 year old male front right passenger, unrestrained (unknown aged) male rear left child passenger, and restrained (unknown aged) male rear center child passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local hospital for treatment of police reported minor injury. The restrained (unknown aged) male rear right child passenger was reported by police to have also sustained minor injury, but was not transported for treatment. The treatment status of the driver and rear seated child passengers were unknown; however, the front right passenger of Vehicle 1 was admitted for further treatment of serious injury sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
