This case involves a 40 year old female driver of a 2008 Ford Expedition EL Sport Utility Vehicle (V1). She was the only occupant and had a deployed frontal airbag. Her belt status was unknown due to the lack of belt loading evidence and the minimal pretensioner activation evidence. The side impact head and thorax airbags did not deploy in this impact. The other vehicle (V2) was a 2003 Winnebago Itasca motor home with a passenger vehicle being towed behind. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a wet asphalt divided highway. It was raining and there was a negative 3% grade for both directions of travel with the roadway leveling off in the center of the intersection. There were two southbound lanes and three northbound lanes with the left lane being a turn only lane. The roadway intersected with the on and off ramps of an interstate highway. V1 was traveling at approximately 56 kph (35 mph) in the right southbound lane going straight ahead when V2, who was traveling north in the left turn lane, turned in front of V1. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 with V1 underriding the front of V2. The vehicles came to rest just west of impact. Both were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 sustained serious injuries and was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital. Later she was transferred to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment.
