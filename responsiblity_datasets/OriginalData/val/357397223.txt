This case involves an impact between the right side of a compact SUV and the front of a minivan. The restrained 19-year-old female driver is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2004 Ford Escape compact SUV, was northbound in the outside lane of a divided, dry, level asphalt four-lane traffic-way, approaching a four-leg intersection. The north- and southbound road each had parking lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Dodge Caravan minivan, was traveling in the outside lane of the southbound road approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. A non-contact vehicle in the parking lane pulled into the path of the case vehicle. The driver avoided a collision by steering left. The case vehicle crossed over the centerline, traversed the inside northbound lane, mounted the curb of the raised median, re-entered the road at the four-leg intersection, entered the path of V2 and was struck obliquely on the right fender by the front-end of V2. After impact, the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing east-northeast, south of the intersection, straddling the southbound lanes. V2 rotated clockwise, left the intersection, struck the curb of the intersecting street and came to rest facing northwest. The 19-year-old female driver and the 16-year-old male right-front passenger were restrained by a three-point belt. The frontal-impact air bags did not deploy. The 16-year-old male right-rear passenger was not restrained by a three-point belt. All three occupants were transferred to a level-one trauma center. The right-front and right-rear passengers sustained police reported incapacitating injuries. The right-front was hospitalized. The right-rear passenger was treated and released. The driver sustained serious injuries and was enrolled as a case occupant.
