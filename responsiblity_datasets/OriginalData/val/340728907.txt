The 168 cm/ 72 kg (5' 6"/159 lbs.) 51-year-old male driver of the 2010, four-door Kia Optima sedan was unrestrained by a three-point belt, but had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. During the severe offset, frontal, 12 o'clock impact with a tree, the case occupant moved forward and slightly outboard relative to the vehicle interior. An attempt to resuscitate the case occupant was not successful and he died on-scene. The contusion to the left clavicle (shoulder) is possibly due to contact with the left, upper A-pillar. The left hemothorax, the lacerations of pericardium, inferior vena cava, and liver are due to contact with the steering wheel assembly via the deployed air bag. The contusion to the right shoulder is from an unknown source. The abrasion to the right knee and the laceration to the left knee are due to contact with the knee bolster. The abrasion to the right, medial ankle is possibly due to contact with the foot pedals.
