This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 69-year-old female belted right front passenger with deployed frontal airbags. This occupant was riding in an intermediate size station wagon, when it was involved in a frontal collision to the rear of a farm tractor. The case vehicle sustained moderate damage. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred at dusk on a dry clear evening. A 2011 Subaru outback intermediate size station wagon (Vehicle 1) was traveling southwest on a bituminous two-lane rural road. A farm tractor of unknown size (Vehicle 2) was traveling ahead of V1 and slowing to make a left turn. The grade of the road was level. V2 began slowing to turn left. V1 proceeded straight without decelerating and impacted the rear of V2 with its front plane (Event 1). Both vehicles came to rest in the road. V1 was occupied by a 69-year-old female right front passenger. She was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by loading to the latch plate. The retractor pretensioner did not show evidence of actuating in the crash, despite the driver's pretensioner actuating. This vehicle was not equipped with anchor or buckle pretensioners. The steering wheel hub and top right instrument panel airbags deployed. The available outboard seatback and curtain airbags did not deploy. There were no other airbags installed. This occupant was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. The case vehicle was driven by an 80-year-old male. He was wearing his seat belt and the frontal airbag deployed. He was uninjured in the crash.
