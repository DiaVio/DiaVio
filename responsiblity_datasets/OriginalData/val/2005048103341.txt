It has a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and intersects with a two-lane, level, bituminous roadway that curves to the left and runs east to west. This intersection was controlled by a traffic light (on colors) with no pedestrian signal.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Chevrolet Caprice was traveling southbound and was attempting to turn left and travel eastbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1990 Chevrolet Corsica was traveling northbound. As V1 was making its turn, V2 was attempting to cross through the intersection. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2. Post impact the vehicles deflected to the right and the front of V1 one contacted pole. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 was a 47-year-old male in good health & well rested. He was on an errand coming from a friend's house to go to a mechanic to pick up his car and was not in a hurry. The driver stated that he pulled up to the light and stopped for a few seconds in the left turn lane. When the light turned yellow he thought V2 was going to stop and so he started to turn left. He tried to avoid the impact by accelerating, but this was unsuccessful. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling/ turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver decision factor: false assumption of other user's actions.
