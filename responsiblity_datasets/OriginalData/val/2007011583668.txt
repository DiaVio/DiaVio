The crash occurred on a one way exit ramp that curved to the left. The midweek, early afternoon crash occurred off the right side of a level, bituminous, exit ramp from one interstate roadway to another. At the time of the crash it was daylight, clear and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 113 kmh (70mph).

V1, a 2005 Ford F-150 Crew Cab pickup solely occupied by a 47-year-old driver, was westbound in the exit lane described above decelerating preparing to negotiate the exit curving to the left. The 2 westbound lanes of the interstate he was exiting continued on to the west. As the driver attempted to steer left he found that the vehicle did not respond. V1 ran off the right side of the road but the driver continued to steer left and stayed just off the road as he attempted to re-enter the roadway. V1, right, contacted a traffic sign then V1, right, contacted a second traffic sign. V1 then went into a counterclockwise yaw and crossed the roadway exiting the roadway on the left. As V1 exited the road in a counterclockwise yaw its right side contacted a delineator post. V1 continued down an embankment, right side leading, and rolled over to the right 7 quarter turns coming to rest on its left side facing east-northeast. The driver was uninjured. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver stated that he was coming home from work by the route that he takes daily decelerating to about 89 kmph (55 mph) ready to exit the westbound expressway. He stated that as he tried to turn the vehicle it did not respond and he felt the vehicle going straight. He thought he had a flat tire on the right front. The driver and the researcher both found a screw lodged in the right front tire. The driver said he was fatigued after work but had gotten the usual amount of sleep the night before. He also said he was driving one-handed when he started entering the exit.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions". The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded “too fast for curve”. Some contributing factors on the part of V1 include the driver's fatigue, tire deficiency (screw in tire), the driver's insufficient braking inputs and his steering with only one hand when the vehicle did not respond when he tried to turn.

It should also be noted that the evidence at the scene did not indicate that any tires were flat prior to the left side road departure even though the 2 right side tires were flat at final rest.
