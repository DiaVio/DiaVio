Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway negotiating a curve to the left. The roadway was dry and the weather conditions were daylight and dry. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 56-year-old male, drifted off the roadway to the right where it struck a small object and then a telephone pole with its front, coming to immediate final rest. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1 was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
