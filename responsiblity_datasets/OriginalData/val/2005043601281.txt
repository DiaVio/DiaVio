This two-vehicle crash occurred at 07:59 hours on a 3-lane, undivided roadway in a suburban area during congested weekday traffic. The roadway runs east and west and has a center turn-lane for both directions with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The road is straight, level and there is a gas station near the crash location. Weather conditions were daylight, clear, and dry.

Vehicle 1, a 2000 Dodge Stratus 4-door, was traveling west in lane 1 at approximately 35 mph when it entered the center-turn lane. V1 was nearly 250 meters away from the intersection at which its driver was going to turn left, but the traffic in lane 1 was so backed-up she decided to go ahead and pass the vehicles that were stopped in her lane. Vehicle 2, a 1997 Ford Explorer XL 2DR, was exiting a gas station parking lot and attempting to turn left into the eastbound lane. As V2 traveled across the roadway, it was struck almost head-on by V1. All the occupants in both vehicles received minor injuries but refused treatment on the scene. Both vehicles had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1 was a 24-year old female who took a vacation day that morning with her friend so they could take care of some errands. She reportedly saw V2 "inching" into traffic as she drove through the center lane and even though she took her foot of the accelerator, she did not think V2 would continue across her path. Once V2 crossed her path, she steered left and locked her brakes. The two vehicles came to rest in the eastbound lane.

This driver admitted she was conversing with her friend before and during the crash, but declines that it distracted her. She reportedly is in good health, does not take medication, and has good vision. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded: (72) other vehicle encroached from driveway, turning into opposite direction. The Critical Reason for the Precrash Event was (1) not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to this driver include her conversation with her passenger, her false assumption that V2 would yield the right-of-way, and the rush hour congestion of traffic.

The driver of V2 was a 22-year old male that did not speak English; however, his passenger spoke well enough to refuse to cooperate. Their vehicle was towed back to their home before I arrived and permission to do an inspection was never granted. V2's driver received a citation for not having a driver license and for a safe movement violation. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded: (15) this vehicle turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Precrash Event was coded: (113) inadequate surveillance. Since there was no interview with this driver, the only associated factor coded was the rush hour congestion of traffic.
