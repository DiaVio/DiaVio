V1, a 1996 Pontiac Grand Prix, was traveling northbound on a three-lane interstate divided by a concrete median wall. The roadway was wet and level concrete. The crash occurred in the early evening hours while dark, but the roadway was illuminated. The driver of V1, an 18-year old male, was driving two friends to his house. He stated that he was traveling in lane one and knew that vehicles would be trying to merge onto the highway and so he changed lanes to the left (twice), entering lane three. He went off the roadway to the left where he hit a patch of snow. He then lost control and contacted the barrier wall off the left side of the road with the front left side of his vehicle. V1 then rotated in a counterclockwise direction and the right side of V1 struck a light pole. V1 continued its rotation, skidding across all three lanes of travel to the right where the left rear of V1 impacted a guardrail. V1 came to final rest off the roadway facing south.

The driver of V1 reported that he had been traveling over 113kmph (70mph) prior to the crash. He had no health-related problems and had taken no medications prior to the crash. He was rested and traveling to his house. He does not wear corrective lenses. He was uninjured and refused treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for the driver of V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was aggressive driving behavior, because he was speeding and cutting across two lanes of traffic to get around merging traffic. Associated factors coded to this driver include conversation with passengers, excess speed, inadequate evasive action (by his own admission, he never applied the brakes), poor directional control, driver inexperience, low tread on the tires and the wet roadway.
