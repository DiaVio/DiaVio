This far side severe crash involved a 50 year old female driver who was restrained and sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. This far side impact crash occurred in the five southbound lanes of a divided freeway at an interchange during daylight hours while it was raining and the roadways were wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Toyota Corolla four door sedan, was merging from a right curve on-ramp lane to the southbound lanes. The on ramp lane was bordered by concrete barriers prior to entering the freeway. V1 lost control and began to rotate clockwise 90 degrees while negotiating the on ramp. V1 departed the lane to the left, and the back bumper of V1 contacted the concrete barrier with an end-swipe type damage impact (minor). V1 then continued to slide laterally across southbound lanes, 1, 2, and 3 and entered lane 4 almost perpendicular to the southbound travel lanes. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Lincoln Town Car four door sedan, was travelling in the southbound lane 4 and the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1 (severe impact). After the impact with V2, V1 entered into lane 3. Vehicle three (V3), a 2015 International semi truck/trailer was traveling in the southbound lane 3, and the right side fender area of V1 impacted the left side of V3. V1 then rotated counterclockwise and the back right and side impacted the left side of the trailer again, while going slightly under the trailer. V3 came to a stop in the southbound lane 3 with V1 still partially under the left side of the trailer facing south at final rest. V2 drifted to the left and came to final rest partially in lane 5. Both V1 and V2 were towed due to damage. V3 was driven away. The driver of V1 is the case occupant with no other passengers. She is a 50 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. She sustained severe injuries and was transported and hospitalized at the trauma center.
