The crash occurred at an intersection in the north/south roadway with an east/west road terminating at the intersection in the eastbound direction. There was a cement median dividing the three lanes in the southbound direction from the three lanes in the northbound direction. The east/west roadway had one westbound lane and two eastbound lanes. Due to the termination of the road in the eastbound direction, it is assumed that lane one is used for right turns and lane two is for left turns. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph), the roads were dry and the sky was clear during the dawn hours of the weekday. There was an uphill slope of two percent in the southbound and eastbound directions.

V1 a 2001 Cadillac Deville 4-door sedan was driven by a 30 year-old female traveling with her 7 year-old son. She stated that she had just left home on her way to drop her son off at school and then go to work when the crash occurred. She was traveling south in lane two, traveling at a rate of 64 kmph (40 mph), approaching the intersection when she began tracking V2's approach, from her right, eastbound in lane one at a high rate of speed, from about a block away. The driver of V1 assumed that V2 would turn right since it was traveling in the right turn lane and wasn't slowing. She continued to assume, that since she had the green light and was occupying lane two, that V2 would turn into the southbound lane one. When she entered the intersection, she saw that V2 was traveling to fast to make the sharp turn into lane one and continued into lane two, her travel lane. She braked and steered left in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid V2. The front of V1 crashed into the left side of V2. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and V1's left front contacted V2's right front. The driver of V1 was 3 months pregnant and transported for non-incapacitating injuries. Her son was neither injured or transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

She entered the intersection traveling east in lane two, the left turn lane at a rate of 48 kmph (30 mph). She stated that the light was green as she approached the intersection and green when she entered the intersection, which is why she never slowed down prior to her attempted left turn. The driver never saw V2 prior to the crash. The driver of V2 had taken a defensive driving course one month prior to this crash. She was transported for non-incapacitating injuries and later released.
