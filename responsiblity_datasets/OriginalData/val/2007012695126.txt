This crash occurred on a snow covered undivided asphalt roadway that had two lanes in each direction. In the eastbound direction, the roadway curved to the left. The posted speed was 56 kmph (35 mph). The radius of curvature was 141m. The curve superelevation was 2 percent. The crash occurred at the end of the week in the early afternoon and it had been snowing.

Vehicle #1, a 2002 Chevrolet Impala 4-door, was traveling east in lane #1 negotiating a sweeping left curve. The driver of V1 began to lose control of the vehicle and it started to rotate counterclockwise. It departed its lane of travel to cross lane #2 and then the centerline. While perpendicular across the westbound lanes of travel, the front right side of V1 was struck by the front left of V2, a 1992 Ford F-150 pick-up. V2 had been traveling in lane 2, but had tried to avoid V1 by decelerating and steering right into lane #1. After V2 contacted V1, V1 continued to rotate counterclockwise and the right rear side of V1 sideslapped the left rear side of V2. This second impact sent V2 up onto the curb for final rest. V1 rotated to face southwest in lane #2 for final rest. The driver of V1 and the driver and occupant of V2 were not injured in the crash but both vehicles had to be towed from the crash scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

She stated she was on her way to work after attending class at the local college. She stated she was thinking about the class she had just attended as she traveled east in lane #1. She stated as she negotiated the curve, her vehicle started to rotate counterclockwise and travel across the centerline. After being struck by V2, her vehicle rotated further to contact the left rear box side of V2.

The driver of V2 was a 44-year-old male who reported being in good health but was taking medication for both high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He stated he does not wear corrective lenses. He stated he was traveling west in lane #2 going to a doctor's appointment for a foot problem. He stated his wife had come along if he needed someone to drive him home after the appointment. He stated he saw V1 start to rotate as it came around the curve so he let up on the accelerator and started to change lanes to avoid the crash. He stated that his wife yelled "she's going to hit" and then the two vehicles hit and he ended up on the curb.
