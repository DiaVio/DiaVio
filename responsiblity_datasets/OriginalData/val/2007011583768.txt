The two-car crash occurred in the intersection of a three-lane urban roadway and a six-lane urban roadway controlled all 4 ways by electronic traffic signals. The three-lane roadway had one lane each way with a left turn lane for northbound traffic at the light. It was bituminous, dry and straight with an uphill grade of 5%. The six-lane roadway had two straight lanes each way and a left turn lane and a right turn lane for eastbound traffic. It was bituminous, straight, dry and level. At the time of the midweek holiday, midday crash, it was daylight and the weather was cloudy. The posted speed limit for the east-west roadway was 72 kmph (45mph).

V1, a 1995 Saturn occupied by a 22-year old female driver and a 23-year-old female passenger, was northbound in lane one of the three-lane roadway described above approaching the intersection. V2, a 2005 Acura 4 door solely occupied by a 51-year-old female driver, was eastbound in lane two of the six-lane roadway described above. V1 attempted to pass straight through the intersection while accelerating even though her traffic signal was red. V2 was passing straight through the intersection, at a constant speed, on a green signal. V2, front, contacted V1, left, causing it to rotate counter-clockwise and striking V2, left, with its left side. V2 continued to rotate counter-clockwise until it came to rest facing south in the intersection. V1 continued east where it came to rest facing east. The driver of V2 was transported. Both vehicles were towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 stated that she and her passenger had just come out of a fast-food drive-thru and approached the intersection at about 36 kmph (25 mph) and then must have looked down at her food and did not notice that the light was red. She did not see V2 until it was about to impact her car. They were on their way to a picnic on this weekday and were not in a hurry but she was not familiar with the roadway.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "crossing over (passing through) intersection". The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was “internal distraction”. Some contributing factors on the part of V1 include the driver's focus (distraction) on an internal object, her failure to stop for a red light and the fact that she was unfamiliar with the roadway/area.

The driver of V2 stated that she was going straight at about the speed limit, passing through the intersection with a green light in lane two, when V1 came from her right front. She never saw V1 until she was impacting it. She was not in a hurry and was familiar with the roadway/area.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was " other vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path". The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. There were no medical, fatigue, mechanical or driver decision factors found to be associated with V2.
