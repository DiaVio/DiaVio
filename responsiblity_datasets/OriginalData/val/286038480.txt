This case involves a moderate frontal impact resulting in cervical spine and upper extremity injuries to the left front case occupant (driver). The crash occurred during daylight hours. Due to a recent blizzard, a large amount of snow had been plowed onto both shoulders of the roadway. Snow was blowing across the roadway at the time of crash. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Kia Spectra 4-door sedan, was traveling in the northbound lane of a three-lane roadway (one northbound lane, one southbound lane, northbound left turn lane between). Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo SUV, was travelling in the southbound lane approaching the case vehicle. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 89 km/h (55 mph). The crash occurred when V2 departed the right side of the southbound lane, impacting the snow bank. The driver of V2 overcorrected by swerving to the left, crossing through the turning lane and into the lane of oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid impact by steering to the left, but was unsuccessful. The right front corner of V2 impacted the front of V1 in an offset frontal configuration. After initial impact, V2 rotated counter-clockwise approximately 90 degrees, impacting the left side of V1 with its right side in side-slap type impact. V2 then came to rest in the southbound travel lane facing northeast. V1 continued north and impacted the snowbank within the right shoulder with its front right corner. V1 came to final rest at this point of impact, facing northeast. The 55 year old female driver (case occupant) was the only occupant of the case vehicle. Her available lap and shoulder belt was spooled out during inspection, indicating it was in use at the time of the crash. The available frontal airbag deployed for her seating position. The case occupant was transported to a level one trauma center for treatment of her cervical spine and upper extremity injuries.
