Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 26-year old, female driver, of a 2008 Dodge Caliber, who was involved in a frontal collision with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight) of a spring weekday, on a two-lane, straight roadway. This bituminous roadway runs generally north and south and has a negative downhill grade, for the southbound travel direction, which becomes level in the area of the crash. The speed limit is 45 mph (72 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was reported to be dry. The overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2008 Dodge Caliber, was being operated by the 26-year old female driver (case occupant), in the southbound travel lane. There were no other occupants present. The driver was not belted, but the vehicle was noted to be equipped with frontal air bags, a knee bolster air bag (driver only), side impact air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. Crash: As Vehicle 1 traveled south, it departed the right side of the roadway and traversed a small drainage ditch as it paralleled the roadway. Vehicle 1 eventually crossed over a private driveway at which time it struck a tree with its frontal plane. Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise as it rebounded off the tree and came to rest at the area of the private driveway, facing a southeasterly direction. As a result the tree impact, Vehicle 1's frontal air bags deployed, as did the driver's knee bolster air bag. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
