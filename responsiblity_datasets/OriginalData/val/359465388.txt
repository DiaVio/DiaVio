This near-side impact crash case involves a 79 year female front right passenger with no air bag deployments who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a four legged intersection controlled by traffic signals. The north-south roadway consists of six asphalt travel lanes, two for northbound vehicles, three for southbound vehicles, and left turn only lanes present at the intersection. The intersecting east-west roadway has three lanes, with one eastbound lane, one westbound lane, and left turn only lanes present at the intersection. There is an uphill grade for vehicles heading north and a downhill grade for vehicles traveling south. At the time of the crash, there were rainy weather conditions and wet roadways. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Dodge Caravan minivan, was traveling south in the inside southbound left-turn only lane, and vehicle 2 (V2), a 1997 Ford F-150 large pickup, was traveling north in lane one. V1 began to turn left and V2 entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise and traveled a short distance north, before coming to final rest near the northeast corner, facing northeast.
