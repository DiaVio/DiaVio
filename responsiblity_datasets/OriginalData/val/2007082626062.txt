The speed limit for both vehicles is 48 kmph (25 mph). At the time of the crash the sky was cloudy and the roads were wet but it was not raining at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Nissan Pathfinder SUV driven by a thirty (30) year old male, was traveling east in lane one. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Kia Sportage SUV driven by a forty six (46) year old female with one passenger, was traveling north in lane one. Both vehicles entered the roadway at approximately the same time. V2 impacted the right side of V1 causing it to deflect counter clockwise and impact a utility pole on the north/west corner, where it came to rest. After impact V2 was then driven to south side of the east leg of the intersection and parked. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V2 was unable to be interviewed and her vehicle was unable to be inspected after numerous attempts to contact.

The driver of V1 ignored the yield sign and failed to yield the right of way to V2.

The critical reason for the critical event assigned to this driver is coded as a driver related factor: type of driver error unknown. Due to lack of driver interview it could not be determined if the drive made a recognition or decision error.
