The 180cm (5'11"), 178kg (393lbs) 38-year-old male driver of the 2003 four-door Dodge Neon was unrestrained and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He moved forward and inboard relative to the vehicle interior in response moderate 12 o'clock frontal impact with a minivan. There were multiple lacerations to the superior aspect of right forehead. These included a 2-cm laceration overlaying the right eyebrow and the multiple abrasions and contusions to the right face are attributed to contact with the rearview mirror. The contusions to the right hip are probably due to contact with the center instrument panel. The contusions to the right middle and right upper quadrant of the abdomen are probably due to contact with the steering assembly. The contusions to the right knee, the fracture of the posterior wall and column of the right acetabulum, and the comminuted fracture of the right iliac bone are due to contact with the center instrument panel. The moderately comminuted and displaced fracture of the right patella is due to contact with knee bolster.
