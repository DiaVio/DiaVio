This frontal crash case involves a 76 year old restrained female with a non-deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during the daylight hours in wet and rainy weather. The collision occurred in the intersection of a three- lane, bituminous level roadway intersected by a three-lane (two southbound lanes and one northbound lane) bituminous level roadway. Both roadways are controlled by a traffic control device. The case vehicle (V1) a 2003 four-door Honda Civic (Hybrid -gas/NIMH)) was being driven westbound in the right lane of a three lane roadway (two westbound straight lanes with one left turn lane). Vehicle two (2) a 2002 four-door Chevrolet K2500 pickup was being driven southbound in the left turn lane. The crash occurred when V1 (case vehicle) entered the intersection (attempting to crossover) and impacted the left side of V2 who was attempting to execute a left turn. After impact V1 (case vehicle) rotated counterclockwise 40 degrees to final rest in the middle of the intersection. After impact, V2 rotated clockwise 20 degrees to final rest in the middle of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. V1 was driven by a 76 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. This restraint was equipped with a buckle type pretensioner that did fire as a result of the impact. The available steering wheel mounted air bag did not deploy as a result of this frontal crash. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance.
