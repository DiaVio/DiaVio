The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a four-lane interstate with two emergency shoulders and concrete barriers on the west and east sides. The highway has a posted speed of 105 KMPH (65 MPH). Conditions were early evening on a weekday with dry roads and clear skies. The roadway was straight and level with traffic flow stop and go as it was still rush-hour traffic.

V1, a 1994 Honda Civic, was traveling in lane four going approximately 105 kmph (65 mph). The driver claimed another driver who apparently had road rage was threatening him. He stated in the interview that for the last mile he was being “chased” by a random driver who kept trying to cut him off. The phantom vehicle caught up to V1 and purposely cut into his lane. In order to avoid a crash he slammed on his brakes and steered left, this caused his vehicle to depart the roadway on the left side and impact the left concrete wall. After he impacted the left wall his vehicle rotated right across every traffic lane and made contact with the right concrete median. The phantom vehicle never stopped. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

V1 was driven by a 22 year-old male in good health, was rested, and on his way to work. He stated he was trying to avoid a vehicle that purposely cut him off when he lost control of his vehicle and hit the wall. The driver of V1 was transported with incapacitating injuries and his vehicle was towed due to damage.
