This two-vehicle crash occurred in a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. The east/west roadway is level and straight and consists of two lanes in each direction and a center left turn lane. The speed limit on this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). The north/south roadway is straight and level and consists of one lane in each direction with a left turn lane at the intersection. The speed limit on this roadway is 40 kmph (25 mph). This crash occurred during daylight hours with no adverse atmospheric conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Chrysler Town and Country, was westbound in lane two. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Mazda Tribute, was southbound in lane two, the left turn lane. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a fifty-two-year-old female, had picked up the two young children that she baby-sits and had been driving for approximately thirty minutes on the way to her home. She was healthy, well rested and comfortable with her vehicle and passengers. She travels this route daily. This driver stated that she did not know what color her traffic signal was prior to the crash. According to the police report, this driver was not wearing her required corrective lenses at the time of the crash.

The driver of V2, a twenty-six-year-old female, had just dropped off her children at school and was on her way to work. She was well rested, healthy and familiar with her vehicle. She travels this route daily. This driver stated that she entered the intersection, turning left because her traffic signal was green and she did not see V1 due to a vehicle stopped in westbound lane one.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see).

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle. The vehicle stopped in westbound lane one created a sightline restriction that was an associated factor in this crash.
