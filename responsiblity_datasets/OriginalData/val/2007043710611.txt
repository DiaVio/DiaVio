Case Summary 2007-43-190

This three-vehicle rear-end crash occurred during the evening hours, on an urban roadway leading into the center of the city. This roadway is level, curves left and is lit with overhead amber street lighting. It's divided by a grass median with no positive barriers present. There are three southbound lanes and four northbound lanes. An east/west road intersects this roadway as an overpass. East/west traffic can enter this roadway via a circular on-ramp. The northbound right lane is designated as a merge lane that eventually ends. The posted speed limit is 56 kph (35 mph). Conditions were clear and dry. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.

V1 is a 1997 Nissan Maxima, four-door with one occupant traveling northbound in lane two. V2 is a 1991 Toyota Corolla, four-door with two occupants traveling northbound in lane two. V3 is a 2008 Chevrolet Malibu, four-door with four occupants, traveling northbound in lane two. There were two non-contacts vehicles broken down in northbound lane one. V1 and V2 had just entered this roadway via the on-ramp from the east/west road. They both had to merge left due to the broken down vehicles ahead of them in the merge lane. V2 came to an abrupt stop in lane two after it had passed the broken down vehicles due to backed up traffic. V1 was not able to stop in time, even though it braked and steered right. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V2 (Event 1). The force of that impact pushed V2 into V3. The front-right plane of V2 contacted the back-left plane of V3 (Event2). V1 suffered disabling damage and came to final rest near the impact point. V2 drove to the left shoulder after impact and V3 pulled over to the right shoulder and parked.

The driver of V1 is a 33 year-old male who was not injured in this crash. He is a full-time graduate student who is currently not employed. He spent the afternoon at a friend's house and was heading back home when this crash occurred. He had just entered this roadway from a semi-circle on-ramp. He immediately merged into the left lane, due to the right merge lane ending up ahead. He noticed two cars parked on the right side, in the merge lane and thought they might have been involved in an earlier crash. As he was going by the parked cars, he glimpsed right at the cars. When his eyes returned to the roadway straight ahead, V2 had entered his lane presumably from the right and immediately stopped. However, he was unsure if V2 was in his lane the whole time, or if V2 merged somewhere from the right lane. He hit the brakes, but before they engaged, he struck the rear-plane of V2. His vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling front-end damage

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 is “Other vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating.” The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was “Exterior Distraction,” a driver related error. This driver told me when he drove past the two broken down cars, he looked right to see what was going on. When his eyes returned forward, traffic had come to an unexpected stop due to heavy traffic. He did brake and steer right, but not until he was too close to V2. He suffers from high blood pressure and a hypothyroid condition, which he treats with prescription medication. This driver failed to look far enough ahead to recognize the congested traffic flow. He did have the radio on while driving, a non-driving activity. Congested traffic was an associated traffic flow factor for V1, V2 and V3.

The Driver of V2 is a 43 year-old male who suffered minor injuries in this crash. On this night, he was driving his girlfriend to the hospital to be checked out because she wasn't feeling well. He intended to travel straight on his original roadway, but due a police traffic stop, police had the intersection blocked off. So to bypass the backup, he took the off-ramp to go a different way. As he entered the new roadway from the ramp, he immediately noticed two vehicles broke down near the overpass, in the right merge lane. He said there was “A LOT GOING ON,” in the area of the crash. He says he merged left with no problems, but once past the broken down cars, traffic in front of him came to an abrupt stop due backups. He was able to brake in plenty of time without hitting V3. He said he was stopped for 10 seconds, before looking in his rearview mirror and seeing V1 coming toward him quickly. He's convinced the driver of V1 was distracted because he made no attempt to brake or avoid striking him from behind. He said V1 struck him so hard that it pushed him forward into V3. He did try and steer left to avoid striking V3, but it happened too quickly that it was unavoidable.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 is “Other vehicle in lane, traveling the same direction with a higher steady speed.” The Critical Reason was “Not coded to this driver.” Although driver of V1 and the witness claim this driver made an aggressive lane change to the left, scene evidence and damage patterns appear to support the statement by the driver of V2. He did admit to talking to his girlfriend prior to the crash since she wasn't feeling good. He did admit to being in a concerned emotional state because his girlfriend was sick and he was trying to get her to the hospital. A source close to this driver advised me that he does have a lazy eye; its unknown how this might affect his driving since he denied any medical conditions to me.

The driver of V3 is a 40 year-old female who was not injured in the crash. She was unable to be contacted after several attempts for an interview. She is from out of state and had three other passengers with her in a rental car. Her vehicle sustained minor damage and was driven away from the scene.

V3 was not involved in the first harmful event. Since the driver was not interviewed and the vehicle was not inspected, there are no known associated factors for this driver.

*Witness 1 was traveling several cars behind V1. He claims that V2 cut out in front of V1, causing V1 to rear-end it. In his opinion, he believes the driver of V2 was driving carelessly and may have purposely cut in front of V1 to cause an accident. He was unable to tell me where the two disabled vehicles in the right lane were broke down in relation to where the crash occurred. He was also unsure if V2 pulled out from behind the disabled cars or from in front of them.

*I determined that the driver of V2 had the most reliable description of what happened that evening despite the witness and V1 driver having similar stories. The driver of V2 drives this roadway daily; where the driver of V1 drives it weekly.
