Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Pontiac G6, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a 6-lane, two-way, urban road (eastbound right turn lane, two through lanes, one left turn lane, two westbound lanes) and was approaching a controlled 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2). a 2003 Chevrolet G2500 Express, cargo van was traveling west in the westbound left-turn lane of the same road and approaching the same controlled intersection. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy and the bituminous road surfaces were dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time with V1's intention to go straight/pass through the intersection and V2's intention to turn left. The front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an oblique head-on configuration. Both vehicles came to rest at an unknown location within the intersection. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 60-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 65-year-old male right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
