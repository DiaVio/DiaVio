This case involves a centered impact to the front of a sport utility vehicle with a tree. There are three case occupants in the case vehicle: The driver, the right-front passenger and the right-rear passenger. The right-rear passenger was fatally injured. The case vehicle, a 2013 Chevrolet Equinox SUV was eastbound on a straight, level, wet asphalt road. It was daylight and raining. The driver experienced an episode of syncope and the case vehicle drove over the left (north) curb, crossed over a sidewalk, entered a public park, side-swiped a 20-cm tree with its left side (minor impact) and then in frontal mode, struck a 54-cm tree. This impact was centered on the vehicle mid-line and between the front longitudinal members. After impact, the vehicle rebounded off the tree and came to rest facing east. The restrained 73-year-old male driver, the restrained 75-year-old male right-front passenger and the restrained 52-year-old female right-rear passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. Both first-row passengers had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact and roof side-rail curtain air bags. The first-row, seatback mounted air bags did not deploy. The right-rear passenger also benefitted from the deployed right-curtain air bag. The driver and right-front passenger were transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as case occupants. The right-rear passenger was treated on-scene, but efforts to resuscitate her were not successful.
