The crash occurred on a westbound two-lane on-ramp with no posted speed limit. This was a level portion of roadway with a slight right curve to the interstate. This was a dry, bituminous, heavily traveled roadway during the mid-morning, late-commuter period of the weekday with cloudy skies. On the right side of the road, there was a 2-meter paved shoulder with loose gravel on top. Guardrails bordered both sides of the on-ramp. The guardrail right of lane one was 2 meters from the right lane line. Lane one merged into lane two prior to connecting with the interstate. Construction was ongoing on this portion of the interstate. The police report indicated a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph); however, there was no posted speed limit sign.

V1 was a 2002 Chevrolet Corvette driven by a 54 year-old male. He stated that he had left his home ten minutes prior to the accident on his way to work, traveling at a speed of 64 kmph (40 mph). The driver stated that V1 was traveling in lane one when a blue Mercedes in lane two passed on the left. The driver stated that he spotted the Mercedes using his left side mirror, and it passed his vehicle on the left. The Mercedes, without notice, suddenly entered lane one occupied by V1. In an attempt to avoid striking the Mercedes, the driver of V1 steered right. The right front wheel of V1 caught in a pothole on the shoulder and the driver lost control in the loose gravel, striking the right guardrail with the front of V1. V1 continued rotating in a clockwise direction, spinning 180 degrees and then striking the same guardrail with the left rear portion of V1. V1 came to rest across lane one facing south. The driver of V1 stated that because lane one was due to end, he did not expect the Mercedes' lane change. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the road on the right side." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was "Too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others." Associated factors include loose gravel lining the shoulder, the pothole on the right lane line, and the on-going road construction.
