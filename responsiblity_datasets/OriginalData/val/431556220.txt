This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 11 year old male front right child passenger of a 2010 Toyota Corolla LE 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags (for the driver and front right passenger positions), seat back mounted side air bags (for the front outboard seating positions), and curtain air bags (for all outboard seating positions). The driver and front right passenger air bags deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a large diameter split-tree bole. The crash occurred off the east pavement edge of a two-lane north/south rural roadway. The straight (asphalt) roadway crested just south of the crash site, and was bordered to the east and west by stands of trees. The speed limit at the crash site was 72 km/h (45 mph). It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The case vehicle was northbound and proceeding straight when the driver allowed it to depart the right (east) pavement edge in a forward tracking mode. Vehicle 1 continued in a northeasterly direction as the front left area subsequently impacted a large diameter split-tree bole (3 or 4 trunks with one common base). The impact resulted in severe damage. Following maximum engagement with the struck tree, Vehicle 1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and rebounded to final rest (off the east pavement edge of the road) facing northwest. The restrained 11 year old male front right child passenger of the 2010 Toyota Corolla was possibly postured abnormally (Possibly leaning inboard/asleep) as the seat was adjusted to a full rearward track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the front right 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At impact, the child passenger initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force. Following the collision, the restrained 50 year old female driver and restrained 11 year old male front right child passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported to a nearby trauma center. The driver was treated and released, as the child passenger was admitted for further treatment of serious injury sustained in the crash. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
