This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 28-year-old male belted driver of a 2010 Hyundai Sonata intermediate size sedan with a deployed airbag. He sustained serious injuries in a multi-event crash with a culvert and an embankment, resulting in minor damage to the case vehicle. The crash occurred during early afternoon daylight hours on a dry road under clear skies. V1 was traveling south on a rural road. The road was curved right with 10% superelevation on a level grade. V1 was negotiating the right curve on this bituminous two-way, two-lane road. V1 traveled left over the center line and departed the left side of the road. V1 continued over the grass shoulder and into a ditch where the front undercarriage impacted a plastic culvert and the ground (Event 1). As V1 passed over the culvert, the rear undercarriage also impacted the culvert and ground (Event 2). V1 continued over a grass driveway before striking an embankment with the front undercarriage (Event 3), coming to rest in a ditch on the left side of the road. V1 was towed due to damage. The 28-year-old male driver was using a lap and shoulder belt. The available retractor pretensioner was actuated. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The steering wheel hub airbag was deployed in the crash. The vehicle was also equipped with a right instrument panel, two outboard seatback, and two curtain airbags which did not deploy. The driver was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
