This multiple event crash case involves a 91 year old restrained male (case occupant) seated in the 2nd row, left seating position who sustained serious injuries. There was also a 56 year old restrained male (non-case occupant) seated in the front left seating position (driver) and a 27 year old restrained male (non-case occupant) seated in the front right seating position with seat back mounted air bag deployed. The crash occurred in the daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a divided four lane bituminous trafficway with two northbound lanes and two southbound lanes basically straight in origin without any intersection or traffic control device involvement. The roadway is level and the North and South travel lanes are separated by a concrete barrier. The posted speed limit is 65 mph (105 kmph). The case vehicle (V1), a 2007 Lincoln Town Car, was being driven northbound in the right travel lane and vehicle two (V2), an unknown vehicle, was being driven northbound in the right travel lane in front of V1. The crash occurred when the driver of V1 fell asleep causing it to impact (unknown V1 plane) with vehicle 2 (also unknown plane) . After initial impact, V1 traveled off the North road edge causing it to rotate 70 degrees to the right (around the longitudinal axis) and impacting a ditch/ embankment with its right side. V1 continued on rotating back 180 degrees to the left where it traveled to its final resting position after rolling onto its left side. V1was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V2 left the scene of the crash without stopping. V1 was driven by a 56 year old male non-case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt (retractor pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted and seat back mounted air bags did not deploy as a result of the impact. There was also a 27 year old male non-case occupant (right front passenger) who was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt (retractor pretensioner actuated). The available instrument panel mounted air bag did not deploy but the seat back mounted air bag did deploy as a result of the impact. The 91 year old case occupant (2nd row left) was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. The seat track and seat belt were not adjustable for this seating location. The case occupant was seriously injured and initially transported to a local hospital and then subsequently transferred by helicopter to a level 1 trauma center.
