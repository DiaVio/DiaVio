This case occupant is a 66 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a frontal air bag deployment. She was involved in a moderate frontal crash and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early morning hours, in darkness with overhead street lights, in the northbound lanes of a six lane, one way, freeway. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt lanes are straight with an uphill grade for northbound vehicles. The two rightmost lanes are exit only lanes. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Saturn Aura four door sedan, was northbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Oldsmobile Alero four door sedan, had been involved in a collision with the impact attenuator that is present as the two right lanes separate from the freeway. V2 was stopped, facing northeast in lane three. As V1 approached V2, the driver of V1 steered left and braked, but the front of V1 impacted the back of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's left front seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag. V2 rotated clockwise and came to final rest in the center of the freeway lanes, facing east. After striking V2, V1 traveled north and came to final rest facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 66 year old female driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed and her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center where she was hospitalized for three days. There were no other occupants in V1.
