This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the middle of four-way residential intersection. The intersection consisted of a 2-lane, east/west roadway intersection by a 2-lane north/south roadway that was controlled by stop signs. Both roadways were bituminous, dry, and level with posted speed limits of 40 kmph (25 mph). The east/west roadway curved right in the westbound direction. At the time of the crash, the sun was brightly shining above the southwest horizon, causing a strong glare. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions although there had been an ice storm earlier in the day.

V1, a 2000 Chevrolet Impala with one occupant, was southbound in lane one approaching the intersection. V2, a 1999 Dodge Intrepid with one occupant, was westbound approaching the same intersection. V1 failed to stop for the stop sign and the left side of V1 was struck by the front of V2. V1 rotated counter-clockwise and came to final rest south of the intersection in lane 1 facing east-southeast. V2 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest on the southwest corner of the intersection facing south. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1, a 20-year-old male, stated that he had just left a job site where he had worked all day. He stated that he had only started working there the day before and was not familiar with the area. As he approached the intersection he looked to the left but a parked truck obstructed his view. When he looked back forward, the sun was directly in his eyes so he reached up for the sun visor. He never saw the stop sign and was still adjusting the visor when he was impacted by V2 as he passed through the intersection. He was uninjured in the crash.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was an environmental related factor, sun glare. Associated factors include the driver being unfamiliar with the roadway/intersection, his view to the left obstructed by a parked vehicle and his fatigue from working all day. Other factors include the dirty condition of the windshield coupled with the sun's glare on it and the ice-covered landscape.

The driver of V2, a 20-year-old female, had just left her home and was running late for work. As she entered the intersection V1 came from her right and was right in front of her. She only had time to swerve left but could not avoid V1. She never saw V1 until just before impact. She was transported for treatment of minor injuries.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, across path. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors for V2 include the driver running late for work, crossing through the intersection with an obstructed view, and her view obscured by the ice-covered windshield while looking into the sun.
