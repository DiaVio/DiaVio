This single vehicle nighttime crash occurred on a rural two-lane asphalt roadway with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The road is level and curves to the left for northbound traffic in the area where the crash occurred. At the time of the crash, it was dark, a few hours before midnight, and the roadway was not illuminated by street lights. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions or road defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1988 Chevrolet Blazer, was northbound and departed the road to the right. The V1 driver steered to the left and V1 re-entered and crossed the road, then departed the road to the left. The V1 driver then steered to the right, and V1 re-entered the road in a clockwise rotation, tripped over and rolled left a total of six quarter turns on the roadway, then came to rest on its top plane partially in the southbound lane and partially off the left road edge facing generally southeast. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 had a total of 7 occupants, one of whom was killed as a result of injuries from complete ejection from V1. No interviews were obtained since the police report was not available until over two months after the case was released.

The V1 driver was a 27-year-old male. The driver's medical report indicated a blood alcohol level of 0.281 and that the driver was not taking any medications. Drug screens at the medical facility showed a positive result for THC.

The critical pre-crash event was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: overcompensation. 5 of 7 occupants of V1 were not restrained or seated in a seat; this may have been an associative factor. The driver was traveling too fast for the curve and also had poor directional control.
