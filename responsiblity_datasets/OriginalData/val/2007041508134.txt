Case #2007-107

The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, five-lane undivided roadway. There were two southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). This was a straight, level, and asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon, with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was congested. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1 and 56 kmph for V2.

V1, a 2000 Ford Econoline cargo van with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. V2, a Volvo S60 with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane two, ahead of V1. V3, a 2002 Porsche 986 Boxster with two occupants, was traveling southbound in lane two, in front of V2. The driver of V1 changed lanes to the left in order to pass a city transit bus that was stopped in his travel lane. As V1 passed the bus, he entered an intersection. On the other side of the intersection, in the same lane, were V1 and V2. Traffic on the south side of the intersection was congested, so V1 and V2 were moving very slowly. The driver of V1 did not slow down in time. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. Consequently, the front of V2 made contact with the back of V3. V2 was towed due to damage.

The Ford Econoline was driven by a 55-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way from his house to a doctor's office. He said that he changed lanes to go around a city transit bus. The motorist advised that as soon as he changed lanes, the vehicle in front of him suddenly stopped. The driver said that he slammed on his brakes and steered to the right to try to avoid V2, but could not stop in time.
