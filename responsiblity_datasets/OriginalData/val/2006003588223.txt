This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the middle of an urban intersection between a one-way roadway and a two-way roadway. The intersection consisted of a one-way westbound roadway and a two-way north-south roadway. The westbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign. Both roadways were dry, straight, level and had a speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1998 Dodge B-series large passenger van with six occupants, was stopped facing west preparing to continue through the intersection.
