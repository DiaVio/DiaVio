Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Chevrolet K1500 Silverado, extended cab pickup was traveling west in the right westbound lane of a 4-lane divided freeway (two lanes westbound, protected median, two lanes eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the left westbound lane next to V1. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V2, for an unknown reason, lost control and suddenly veered to the right and the right side of V2 struck the left-side of V1. V2 was redirected to the left, then the driver steered back to the right and V2 reportedly began a clockwise yaw/rotation. V2 came to rest off the right shoulder of the road facing east. After the initial impact, V1 was redirected to the right and ran off the right shoulder of the road. As V1 began descending down a roadside grassy slope, the driver steered right in an attempt to avoid a 16-cm diameter tree but the left-side of V1 struck and uprooted this tree. This impact redirected V1 back to the left and the front of V1 struck a 30-cm diameter tree. V1 came to final rest against this tree. Both vehicle were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 49-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 41-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 was also transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries.
