Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 22-year-old, male driver of a 2013 Kia Optima 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a frontal collision with a drainage ditch. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the pre-midnight hour (dark), of a spring weekday, on a two lane north/south roadway. This roadway is level, but has a right turning curve for the sound travel direction. The speed limit is 55 mph (89 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2013 Kia Optima 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 22-year-old male driver (case occupant) in the southbound travel lane, approaching the curved section of the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the right turning curve and continue traveling southbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, as Vehicle 1 was negotiating the curved section of roadway it drifted left and across the northbound travel lane and departed the roadway at the east edge. Vehicle 1 subsequently struck a ditch with its frontal/undercarriage area (event 1) and then rolled over (event 2). Vehicle 1 eventually came to rest, on its wheels, in the northbound travel lane, facing a southwesterly direction. As a result of the crash, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed, as did the driver's hip/torso side impact air bag and the left side rail curtain. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
