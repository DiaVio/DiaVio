This severe frontal crash involved a 28 year old female driver who was using the manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal airbag deployment. She sustained severe injuries and was transported and hospitalized at a trauma center. This head on crash occurred at dawn on a two lane, two way highway with paved shoulders near an uncontrolled intersection. It was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Saturn Ion four door sedan was southbound traveling behind an unknown vehicle that was slowing to make a right turn at the intersection. V1 then began to brake, swerved to the left, crossed over the center lane line and entered the northbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Colorado four door pickup truck was travelling northbound and had just passed through the intersection when the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. V1 was pushed rearward from the point of impact, rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest facing southeast on the east shoulder. V2 continued forward and to the right post impact and came to final rest facing northeast on the shoulder with the front of the vehicle partially off the roadway edge. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant. She is a 28 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and her front steering column mounted airbag deployed on impact. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
