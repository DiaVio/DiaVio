The crash occurred at the intersection of two roadways, which were offset from each other twenty-five degrees, forming a V-shape. The first roadway was a two-way, four-lane street, divided by a concrete curbed median. This roadway ran in a southeasterly/northwestern direction. It was controlled by a stop sign in the southern direction. The second roadway was a two-way, three lane undivided street, without any traffic controls. This roadway ran in a southwesterly/northeast direction. Both roadways were straight, level, asphalt streets, with posted speeds of 64 kmph (40 mph). In the southern direction, the two roadways merged into a single roadway, after the stop sign. Conditions were daylight on a weekday evening with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1999 BMW 528i with one occupant, was traveling southeast in lane two of the first roadway. V2, a 1998 Chevrolet C1500 with one occupant, was traveling southwest in lane one of the second roadway. The two vehicles were approaching the same intersection. The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2. The front of V1 made contact with the right side of V2. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.

V1, the BMW 528i, was driven by a 28-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was on his way home from work, when he decided to take an alternate route due to traffic. The driver got turned around somewhere near the airport, and it became necessary to backtrack to a more familiar street. The motorist indicated that when he reached the stop sign, he intended to make a U-turn. The driver did not realize that the traffic lanes to his left, on the other side of the median, were part of a different street altogether. It was inconceivable to the driver that another southbound travel lane existed on the other side of the median. Therefore, the driver was focused solely on oncoming traffic to his front, prior to making the hard left turn. The motorist acknowledged that he did not look over his left shoulder prior to making the turn, and never saw the other vehicle coming.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection." Despite the driver's indication that he was making a U-turn, the movement of the vehicle relative to the roadway would best be described as a hard-left turn, as the driver was turning onto a different street. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a driver-related recognition error, inadequate surveillance. The driver failed to look in the required direction to safely complete the maneuver. One associated factor for this driver was experience-related. It was the driver's first time on an unfamiliar roadway, and he was lost.

V2, the Chevy C1500, was driven by a 54-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he had stopped at a friend's house after work, and was on his way home when the crash occurred. The driver commented that this was his daily route home from work. As he traveled southbound, he saw V2 at the stop sign, but didn't pay much attention to the stopped vehicle. He assumed that V2 would remain stationary. Instead, the driver's attention was focused on two vehicles further up the road. The two cars were pulled off to the side of the street on a sharp curve, which concerned the driver, who was wondering what action they might take as he passed by. The driver said that V1 suddenly and unexpectedly turned into him as he crossed through the intersection.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this driver. One associated factor for this driver was an external distraction. The driver was focused on extraneous vehicles beyond the intersection. Another associated factor included a false assumption. The driver falsely assumed that the driver of V2 would yield the right-of-way. An additional associated factor for the driver was the fact that the driver had been drinking just prior to the crash, and may have been impaired at the time. No BAC test was conducted.
