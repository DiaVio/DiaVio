The 165 cm (5'5"), 68 kg (150lbs) 20-year-old female driver of the 2005, four-door Chevrolet Cobalt sedan was restrained by a three-point belt, but the frontal impact air bags did not deploy. Vehicle one was not equipped with side curtain or seat back mounted air bags. She moved inboard relative to the vehicle interior in response to the severe, 3 o'clock, right-side impact with vehicle two, a 2003 Ford Taurus sedan. The right periorbital contusion, the laceration behind the right ear, the bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage in the cerebral sulci, the subdural hematoma in the falx, the intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and the central basilar skull and right temporal vault fracture are probably due to contact with the upper B-pillar. The mass effect upon the left frontal horn and compressed ventricles are due to edema resulting from the other brain injuries. The right 1st to 8th and left 1st to 4th rib fractures resulting in a flail chest, the pneumomediastinum, the bilateral pulmonary contusions and bilateral pnuemo/hemothorax, the right comminuted distal clavicle fracture, and the mildly displaced T1 right transverse process fracture are probably due to chest contact with the lower B-pillar. The right elbow abrasion, laceration of the right-lower quadrant of the abdomen, the laceration of the right lobe of the liver, the right adrenal hemorrhage, and the mesenteric injury are probably due to contact with the lower rear quadrant of the right-front door. The laceration at the apex of the left lung, the laceration of the spleen posterior to the hilum, and the comminuted fracture of the left hemi-sacrum through the sacral ala with mildly displaced fractures of the left superior and inferior public rami, are probably due to contact with the intruding right-front door. The bilateral hand contusions and contusion to the back of the left knee are from an unknown source.
