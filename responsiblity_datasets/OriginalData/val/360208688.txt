The crashed vehicle and two case occupants were not located until the early morning daylight hours the following day. Vehicle one (V1), 2003 Toyota Highlander was northbound on a two lane, two way highway where the road curved to the left with no paved shoulders. V1 appeared to continue straight in the curve and departed the roadway to the right a short distance before the front of V1 impacted a large tree about 1.3 meters from the edge of the road. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest angled northwest on a downward slope still near the struck tree. V1 was towed due to damage. A driver and front right passenger were in V1, and both are subjects. The driver, a 64 year old female, was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the belt pretensioner actuated and the steering column mounted airbag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to the CIREN trauma center. The front right passenger, a 66 year old male, was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the belt pretensioner actuated and the instrument panel mounted airbag deployed. He was pronounced dead on scene at the time both occupants were located.
