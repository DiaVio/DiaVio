This case involves a moderate to severe, swiping impact between a passenger car and overtaking SUV. The case occupant is the 17-year-old female driver of the passenger car. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the seat-mounted side-impact air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2000, four-door Toyota Avalon was southbound in the curb lane of a dry, level, concrete divided six-lane road. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV was southbound on the same roadway travelling in the center lane. It was dark, but lighted and clear. As V2 was overtaking the case vehicle, it crossed the right lane-line and entered the path of the case vehicle. The right side of V2 swiped left side of the case vehicle. Both vehicles entered a clockwise rotation and departed the roadway. V2 rode over the curb before coming to rest against a pole facing west-northwest. The case vehicle passed though the mouth of a private drive, mounted the curb and struck a cast-iron fence. It came to rest facing northeast. The 17 year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the seat-mounted side-impact air bag deployed. She was taken to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
