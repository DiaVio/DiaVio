The crash occurred on a rural road that in a section that curved from north to west. The road was a two-way, two lane road that was divided by a double yellow line. The lane widths measured 2.6m each. The curve radius measured 52m at its apex. The road had a negative grade (if northwest bound) of 9.2% at the curve apex, a negative 3.3% grade about 3 meters east of right roadside departure, and the south embankment grade at left run off road side varied from -68% to -84%. There was also a utility pole located 0.3 meters south of the roads edge near final rest. Conditions at the time of the crash were dark and unlit late on a weekend night. The speed limit was 48kph/30mph.

V1 was a 1991 Honda CRX traveling in a northwesterly direction on the roadway when while attempting to negotiate the curve left (west) at 10-15mph above the speed limit V1lost control skidding off the right side of the road, then regained the roadway but in a counter clockwise yaw, then departed the left roadside where it tripped and rolled to its right (west), impacted a utility pole with its top and came to rest on its top after 2/4 turns, facing due south with most of the vehicle off the roadway. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was driven by a twenty two year old belted male who had only recently bought the car and was complaining about low tire tread and a personal emotional issue he was dealing with. He was uninjured in the crash.

The critical precrash event for V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason was overcompensation. The driver was coded with inattention due to a personal problem. He also was going too fast, speeding aggressively due to frustration and chose inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive maneuvers. A performance error of poor directional control was also coded. He was driving while upset in a vehicle he was unfamiliar with that had 2 different sizes of tire on it in addition to low tread on those tires.
