A two-vehicle rear end late afternoon collision occurred on a Tuesday. The collision occurred on the northbound lanes of a north/south highway. The northbound lanes are divided, dry, concrete, have a downgrade slope, and consist of six lanes. The sixth lane is an HOV (High Occupancy Vehicle) lane. Double yellow lines distinguish the HOV lane. West of the west edge exists a 1.5-meter (5 ft.) concrete median. West of the west median exists a raised concrete center divider that separates the northbound lanes from the southbound lanes. East of the east edge exists a 5.7-meter (18.7 ft.) asphalt shoulder. East of the east shoulder exists a large rock mountain. The north/south highway is designated a 105 kph (65 mph) zone.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Ford Ranger compact truck with one occupant, was traveling northbound in the number four lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Toyota Camry, four-door sedan with one occupant, was traveling northbound in the number three lane. As V2 was traveling, V1 crossed the lane line on the right and the front plane of V1 contacted the rear plane of V2. V2 rotated clockwise as it traveled towards the east edge. The front plane of V2 contacted the mountain. V2 then proceeded to burst into flames. V1 came to rest facing northbound on the eastern shoulder. V2 came to rest facing southeast against the mountain. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Both occupants were transported. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 is a 19-year-old female traveling home from college. The driver has one year of driving experience. This is only the second time the driver has driven through the collision area. This is the driver's first time driving her father's vehicle. The driver was forced to take her father's vehicle because no other vehicles were available at her home. The vehicle is equipped with an auxiliary tank located in the bed. The driver stated that a vehicle rear-ended her causing her to rear-end V2. Neither the researcher nor police could find evidence of a rear-end impact. Based on the vehicle's damage and the statements of the driver, it appears that V1 crossed into the lane to the right and struck V2. Witness #1 and #2 did not see V1 before the collision.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded “this vehicle traveling-over the lane line on right side of travel lane”. The critical reason for V1 was coded “poor direction control (e.g. failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected).

The driver of V2 is a 53-year-old female traveling home from work. The driver stopped at an ATM prior to heading home from work. The driver was listening to the radio as she was driving. The driver was wearing prescription sunglasses for a myopic condition and astigmatism. The driver's license has a restriction that requires her to wear eyeglasses. The driver has high blood pressure for which she takes Atenolol. The driver performs aerobics every Monday and Thursday for one hour. The driver stated that she observed V1 traveling towards her in a diagonal direction from her left rear. The driver stated that she braced the steering wheel and closed her eyes as she traveled towards the hillside.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded “other vehicle encroachment-from adjacent lane (same direction)-over left lane line”. A critical reason was not assigned to this vehicle,
