This single-vehicle crash occurred on a divided, straight, level roadway, approaching a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. Approximately 25 meters before the intersection, the northbound lanes are divided by a concrete barrier and a metal fence. Beyond the intersection, the two right northbound lanes must enter the freeway and the two left northbound lanes are through lanes. The speed limit on this roadway is 40 kmph (25 mph). It was dark with streetlights on at the time of the crash with heavy rain and congested traffic.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Mercedes Benz SL500 Roadster, was northbound in lane two. V1 traveled to the left and the front struck the concrete barrier. Due to the ramp-like design of the barrier, V1 traveled up on top of the barrier and the fence. V1 then rolled to the right, back onto the roadway. V1 rolled onto its top and came to rest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a sixty-one-year-old male, was on his way home from work. He was in fairly good health and familiar with his vehicle. He travels this route several times each month although it is not his usual route home from work. This driver has high blood pressure, cholestrolemia and anxiety and takes aspirin, Zetia, Niacin, Paxil and Thyroxine. Medical records indicate that this driver tested positive for benzodiazepines.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as " this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the left side." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." V1 traveling too fast for conditions and the rain and wet roadway were associated factors in this crash.
