The case occupant is a 19 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a moderate severity far side impact. The right seat back mounted side air bag and both the left and right curtain airbags deployed during the crash and this occupant sustained severe injuries. This intersection crash occurred in darkness with street lights present in the immediate area. It was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2013 Chevrolet Sonic four door sedan was northbound on a two lane, two way street that intersected with a two lane, two way roadway that angled northeast from the west side and ended at this intersection. There are no traffic controls for the north and southbound traffic, but there is a stop sign posted at the southwest corner of the intersection. V1 approached the intersection intending to make a left turn onto the angled intersecting street; this maneuver involved an approximately 140 degree turn. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Buick Century four door sedan was southbound entering the intersection. The front of V2 then impacted the right side of V1. The impact rotated V1 clockwise and it rolled on its tires backwards toward the southwest corner of the intersection and departed the street. The back of V1 then impacted the stop sign post with very minor damage. V1 came to final rest facing northeast with its back half partially off the roadway. V2 post impact continued forward and to the right and came to final rest facing southwest near V1. The case occupant in V1 is a 19 year old female driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and the left roof side rail curtain air bag deployed in her seating position. The right outboard seat back mounted side air bag and right roof side rail mounted curtain also deployed during the crash. The case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to an outside hospital where she was hospitalized overnight. The following day, she was transferred to the trauma center where she was hospitalized for four days. Another occupant was in V1. She was a four month old female who was secured in a rearward facing child safety seat located in the second row center seating position. The child seat was installed incorrectly using the inboard LATCH anchors of the outboard seats. The infant was transported to the hospital but sustained no injuries.
