The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to the driver of V1 as a driver related decision error: following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of other road users. The driver was following too close in order to react to the unexpected deceleration of the forward vehicle and made a false assumption the forward vehicle would continue to proceed without decelerating. This driver failed to leave enough gap distance in order to stop in time and avoid impact with the forward vehicle, V2. This driver also failed to reduce her speed for the school zone speed limit.
