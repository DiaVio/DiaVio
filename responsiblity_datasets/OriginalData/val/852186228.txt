The case occupant is a 38 year old unbelted female driver involved in a severe frontal corner impact with a frontal impact air bag deployment who sustained serious injuries. This two vehicle crash occurred at night with street lights on a two lane, two way highway with paved shoulders and the surface was wet with overcast weather conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt travel lanes curve to the right and have an uphill grade for westbound vehicles and are level and curve to the left for vehicles traveling eastbound. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Ford Taurus four door sedan, was traveling west in the westbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer four door large utility vehicle, was traveling east in the eastbound lane. As V1 negotiated the curve to the right, V1 crossed the double yellow center lines and V1's front left impacted the front left of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. After striking V2, V1 continued traveling west for quite a distance and came to final rest on the north shoulder, facing west. At the point of impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest on the south shoulder, facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 38 year old female driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed during the crash. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
