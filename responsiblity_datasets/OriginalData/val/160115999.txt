Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 1999 Volkswagen GTI, two-door hatchback (case study vehicle). V1 was occupied by a male, age 17 as its driver and lone occupant. V1's occupant was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and the frontal airbags did not deploy.

The crash occurred during the hours of dusk. The weather at the time of the crash was clear and dry. The roadway surface was dry. The posted speed limit is 25 mph (40 kmph) but police reported V1 as traveling 35 mph (56 kmph).

The crash occurred on a two lane roadway. The eastbound lane has a left curve. The eastbound shoulder is a large grassy area. The westbound lane has a very small grass shoulder with a ditch running through it. The roadway does not have lane markings. The roadway has a positive grade in the eastbound direction.

V1 was traveling eastbound. V1's driver lost control of the vehicle and it started to yaw and rotated clockwise. V1 ran off the left side of the road profiling the left side. V1 started to roll due to the left side tires digging into the ground. V1 rotated onto its left side and struck a tree two trees, on with its hood and one with its roof. The vehicle remained on its left side against the trees.

The case study participant was transported by air to a trauma center.
