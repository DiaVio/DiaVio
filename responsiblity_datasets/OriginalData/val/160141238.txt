This 81-year-old male case occupant was the driver of a 2003 Mercedes E320 that was involved in a moderate frontal collision with two parked vehicles. The case occupant was wearing the available three-point seat belt and the available frontal air bags deployed. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. The case occupant is 170 cm (67 inches) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lbs). Per pre-hospital report, the case occupant was awake and reported that he tried to brake but that the car went faster instead. This statement made the review committee decide that the case occupant was awake and not slumped over at the time of the crash. The contact with the first parked vehicle may have generated some pre-impact occupant kinematics. Based on the evidence dual injury causation scenarios were developed. Impact with the second parked vehicle caused the case occupant to move forward as the air bag deployed. The case occupant's head contacted the air bag, while the case occupant's knees also moved forward, causing the bilateral knee contusions by striking the knee bolster. The case occupant's cervical spine and proximal thoracic spine fractures were possibly the result of the case occupant's head striking the steering wheel through the air bag, resulting in the head and neck bending backwards causing hyperextension to the cervical spine, in turn resulting in the spinal fractures and spinal cord injury. There is also a possibility the initial impact moved the occupant slightly outboard and forward. This movement may have placed the occupant's head in position to interact with the deploying air bag during the second impact with vehicle #3, thus generating the same injurious cervical spine extension and thoracic spine compression. It should be noted the occupant's spine had significant degenerative joint disease, osteophyte formations and spinal canal stenosis. The soft tissue injury to the forehead may have been from steering wheel rim contact or from an unknown contact as his head rebounded from the air bag loading. The case occupant expired after 56 days in the hospital.
