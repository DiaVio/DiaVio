This case involved the belted twenty-three year old male front right seat passenger of a large pickup responding to a frontal, extreme off-set right, impact with the back left corner of a moving flatbed trailer. The frontal-impact air bags deployed. The subject's air bag was found torn. The twelve o'clock principal direction of force impact caused 'severe' vehicle damage and resulted in serious spine injury. This crash occurred on the southbound side of a, divided, multi-lane interstate traveling through a rural area. There were four lanes for southbound travel divided from the two eastbound lanes by a guardrail protected median. The southbound lanes were straight and there was an uphill grade. The weather was foggy but the concrete roadway dry during the early morning (dawn), weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 4-door pickup) was traveling southbound in the right lane intending to continue straight. The vehicle's first row lap and shoulder belts were pretensioner equipped, and there were first row frontal-impact air bags. The 25-year-old male driver and the 23-year-old male front right seat passenger (case subject) were both using their belt restraints. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1995 Freightliner tractor pulling a 1998 Great Dane flat bed trailer with a full load of coiled steel) was traveling southbound in the right lane at a lower, steady, speed than the approaching V1. The driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep as V1 neared the rear of V2. V1 began drifting to the left, out of his lane, as the vehicle struck the back left corner of the trailer with its front-right corner, underriding the larger vehicle. V1's frontal-impact air bags deployed. The subject's air bag had a long tear on its right side, adjacent to the shearing metal of the fender and front right door. The subject's door was completely torn off and deposited in the roadway during the crash. The 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact sheared V1's right front wheel, right fender and front right door off as the vehicle underrode the trailer. V2 continued moving throughout the engagement and as the vehicles separated, V1 rotated approximately 180-degrees clockwise coming to rest in the number-two lane facing north approximately 40 meters beyond the POI. V2 came to a controlled stop along the west shoulder. The case vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject (front right seat passenger) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injuries. The driver sustained only minor lacerations to his right arm.
