This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 46-year-old, female driver with non-deployed airbags. This occupant was driving a compact sedan when she sustained serious injuries in an angled impact with a mid-size sedan. The crash occurred late night on an iced-over bridge while it was snowing. A 2007 Saturn Ion sedan (V1) was traveling south in the left lane of a two-lane, one-way, rural, interstate roadway bridge. A 2010 Mercury Milan sedan (V2) was traveling in the same direction in the right lane ahead of V1. The grade for both vehicles was 7% downhill. V2 lost control on the icy roadway and began a counter-clockwise yaw, traveling partially into the left lane in front of V1. V1 began skidding longitudinally and traveled partially into the right lane. The front of V1 impacted the left back corner of V2 (Event 1). After impact both vehicles came to rest in the roadway. V2 was towed due to damage. The tow status of V1 was not reported. V1 was occupied by a 46-year-old, female driver. She was belted with a non-actuated retractor pretensioner. None of the available airbags deployed, including the steering wheel hub, right mid-instrument panel, and curtain airbags. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
