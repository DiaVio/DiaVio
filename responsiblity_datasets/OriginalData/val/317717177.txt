This case involves an unrestrained 47 year old male driver in a 2013 Chevrolet Impala (V1). V1 was equipped with a dual frontal airbags, dual side airbags, and dual side curtains. The steering mounted airbag was the only airbag to deploy in the crash. V2, a 2007 Dodge Express cargo van, and V3, a 2009 GMC Acadia were also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a level, dry, asphalt, six-lane, divided interstate highway. There were three westbound lanes and three eastbound lanes that were separated by a grass median. The posted speed limit for all travel lanes was 113 kph (70 mph). V1 was traveling west in the far right lane of the westbound lanes. V1 was trailing V2 which was also traveling in lane one of the westbound lanes. V2 was trailing V3 which was also traveling in lane one of the westbound lanes. V3 was having engine problems so its driver applied the brakes causing V3 to decelerate. The driver in V2 also applied his brakes in response to V3 decelerating. The driver in V1 did not notice the vehicles slowing ahead. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V2. V2 was then pushed into the rear of V3. V1 continued a short distance forward and came to rest partially in its original lane and partially in the adjacent lane, facing southwest. After impact with V3, V2 continued across the left lanes and went into the median where it came to rest facing southwest. V3 continued forward and came to a controlled stop in its original lane, facing west. V1 and V2 were both towed due to disabling damage. V3 was not towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 sustained serious injuries in the crash and was transported by air to a level one trauma center for treatment.
