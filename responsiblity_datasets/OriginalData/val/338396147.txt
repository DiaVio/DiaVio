This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 29-year-old female driver with deployed frontal airbags. This occupant sustained serious injuries in a head-on collision with a large utility vehicle. The case vehicle was also occupied by an 11-month-old female second row right passenger restrained in a child seat with no airbag deployment. The crash occurred late morning under cloudy skies on a dry road. A 2008 Toyota Highlander compact utility vehicle (V1) was traveling south on a two-lane two-way suburban bituminous road. V1 was negotiating a left curve as it approached a forked intersection with a side road. A 2001 Dodge Durango large utility vehicle (V2) was traveling north on the same road in the opposite direction negotiating a right curve and approaching the same forked intersection. V2 was reportedly traveling behind a tractor-trailer. The grade for both vehicles was level. The superelevation in the curve was +5%. V2 began turning left at the forked intersection and crossed into V1's lane of travel. V1 and V2 collided head-on (Event 1) in a full frontal configuration. V1 under-rode V2 at impact. After impact, V1 was pushed a short distance west and came to rest in the road. V2 rotated counterclockwise 100 degrees before coming to rest in the road. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 29-year-old female case occupant. She was belted and the available retractor pretensioner was actuated. The steering wheel hub and knee bolster airbags deployed. The available seat back and curtain airbags did not deploy. She was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries.
