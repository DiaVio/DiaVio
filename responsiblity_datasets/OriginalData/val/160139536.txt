The case study occupant is a 20-year-old female wearing a lap and shoulder belt involved in a rollover crash in a 2006 Suzuki Reno. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Suzuki Reno sedan, was traveling west in lane one of a two lane, one way roadway, part of a four lane, two way trafficway divided by a grass median. The weather conditions were dry and dark at the time. For unknown reasons, V1 departed the roadway to the left, entering the downhill grade of the grass median. V1 tried to steer right and re-enter the roadway and lost control, rotating clockwise. V1, continuing to skid, then entered the eastbound lanes of the trafficway, where it tripped over and rolled over eight quarter turns before coming to rest in a ditch on the south side of the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 20-year old female and case study occupant, was properly wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt. No air bags deployed in the crash. The driver of V1 was transported by helicopter to a level-one trauma center.
