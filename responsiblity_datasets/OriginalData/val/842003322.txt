This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 24 year old female driver of a 2000 Dodge Caravan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1995 Chevrolet Astro minivan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a right curve. Vehicle 2 was southbound and negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 reached the apex of the curve and crossed the centerline, into the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 entered the southbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest along the east shoulder facing southwest. Vehicle 2 also rotated counterclockwise and departed the west shoulder where the right side surface struck a mailbox. Vehicle 2 came to rest off the west shoulder facing southeast. The case vehicle had four occupants, the driver (case occupant), and three children who were all seated in the rear of the van. The case occupant and two of the children were restrained by the available lap and shoulder belts. The remaining child was restrained in a child safety seat. Following the crash, all four occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center. The driver was hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries. The driver sustained multiple injuries as a result of the crash, with an MAIS of 3 and an ISS of 10. The police report indicated possible injuries for the children; however, their treatment status was unknown. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
