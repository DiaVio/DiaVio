This two vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours in the three westbound, one way lanes of a divided freeway that had an upgrade. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Corolla four door sedan was travelling westbound in lane 2 when V1 became mechanically disabled and was driven to the south shoulder. As V1 came to a stop angled southwesterly on the shoulder, it began to roll backwards due to the upgrade in the road and crossed lane 3 and entered into lane 2. Vehicle two (V2), a 1990 Toyota Camry wagon was westbound in lane 2 and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise and the left side of V1 impacted the right side of V2. V1 came to final rest in lane one facing northwest. V2 also rotated clockwise post impact and came to final rest facing north in lane 3. Both vehicles were damaged and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and another occupant was in the back seat of V1. The case driver, a 51 year old female, was not belted and no air bags deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was taken to local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center. The other occupant in V1, a 61 year old male, was lying down across the second bench seat and was unrestrained. He sustained minor injuries and was treated at the local hospital.
