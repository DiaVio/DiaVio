This case involves an impact to the front of the case vehicle with the front of another passenger car. The case occupant is the 63-year-old male driver who was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel and curtain air bags deployed. The case vehicle, a 2009 four-door Cadillac DTS, was northbound on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt road, negotiating a left-sweeping curve. Vehicle Two (V2) a 1998 two-door Dodge Neon was southbound on the same roadway. It was daylight and clear. As V2 negotiated a right-sweeping curve it crossed the center-line and entered the path of the case vehicle. The front end of V2 contacted the front-end of the case vehicle in full frontal-impact mode. After impact, the case vehicle came to rest facing north and V2 came to rest facing south. The 63-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was not wearing a belt restraint, but the steering-wheel and side curtain air bags deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
