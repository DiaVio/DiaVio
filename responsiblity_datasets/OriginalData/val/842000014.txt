This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 34 year old female front right passenger of a 1999 Mazda Miata convertible. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an oblique angle impact with a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a rural two-lane roadway and negotiating a right curve. Vehicle 2 was southbound on the same roadway and negotiating a left curve. It was dark (not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. As Vehicle 2 reached the apex of the curve, the driver observed an (unspecified) animal in the roadway (exact location unknown). The driver of Vehicle 2 steered right in avoidance of the animal, and partially departed the right (west) pavement edge. The driver of V2 subsequently steered left in an attempt to re-direct the vehicle back onto the roadway. V2 re-entered the roadway in a counterclockwise rotation, across the path of V1. As V2 crossed the northbound lane, the right rear side surface was impacted by the frontal area of V1 resulting in moderate damage. Upon impact, V2's rotation was re-directed in a clockwise manner as it came to rest off the east pavement edge facing west. V1 was also re-directed towards the east pavement edge where it came to rest facing northeast. The case occupant, the passenger in V1, was reported to have type A injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage.
