This crash occurred on the right (northern) roadside of an east/west, five-lane undivided roadway. The middle lane was comprised of a two-way left turn lane. The bituminous roadway was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekend afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1995 GMC Jimmy with one occupant, was westbound in lane one. A phantom vehicle was traveling the same direction in an adjacent lane to the left of V1 (lane two). As the phantom vehicle passed, it veered toward V1. The driver of V1 swerved to the right to avoid the other vehicle. V1's right front tire hit the curb as V1 departed the roadway. The front of V1 hit a tree, followed by some shrubs and then a fire hydrant. V1 continued traveling westbound, passing through an adjoining street. The front of V1 then made contact with a large rock, stop sign, more bushes, and finally a building. V1 came to final rest against the building. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 49-year old female, suffered minor injuries but refused treatment.

The driver said that as the vehicle started to pass her, it veered into her lane. She got scared, jerking the wheel to the right to keep from getting hit by the other car. This caused her to leave the roadway, impacting multiple objects along the way.
