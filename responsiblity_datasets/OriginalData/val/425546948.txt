This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 25-year-old female belted driver with a deployed airbag. She sustained serious injuries in a frontal collision with a medium-sized tree, resulting in moderate damage to the case vehicle. The crash occurred midevening on a dry road under clear skies. A 2006 Dodge Ram large pickup truck (Vehicle 1) was traveling east negotiating a left curve with 16% positive superelevation. The bituminous road was two-way, two-lane and in a rural area on level ground. As V1 negotiated the left curve, it departed the road to the right. After traveling approximately 30 meters, V1 struck a 35 cm diameter tree with its front plane (Event 1). V1 came to final rest against the tree; however some of the impact debris detached from the vehicle and damaged a second tree just beyond the first. V1 was towed due to damage. The 25-year-old female driver was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. No anchor or buckle pretensioners were installed. The steering wheel hub and right front instrument panel airbags deployed. No other airbags were installed. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of serious injuries. . .
