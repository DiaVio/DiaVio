This single vehicle crash occurred early morning during daylight hours on a dry, straight, divided, six-lane, level bituminous highway. There are three lanes in each direction and the posted speed limit on the highway is 105 kmph (65 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a two-door 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier driven by a 50 year-old female, was westbound in lane one. There was a heavy truck that had just lost his drive line and gear parts and they were spewn on the highway. V1 was the first of three vehicles to impact the parts. V1 impacted one of the bigger parts with its front. After impacting the part, V1 started to rotate clockwise partially traveling into lane two and then off the right side of the highway leading with its back and impacting a guardrail with its back bumper. V1 then started rotating again, clockwise and ran off the shoulder, down a small embankment and coming to rest on its wheels facing southwest on a walking path. The driver stated she was driving the speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph) when she impacted the debris. She also stated that she did not see the debris until it was too late and did not take any avoidance maneuver. This was a partial interview and no other information was obtained. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: object or animal, object in roadway. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).
