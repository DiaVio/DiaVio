Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Ford Ranger, Supercab, 4x4, pickup was traveling west in the middle westbound lane of a 6-lane divided freeway (three lanes westbound, positive barrier, three lanes eastbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Volvo WGM, dump truck was legally parked facing west on the left shoulder of the westbound side of the freeway and it's occupants were outside of the vehicle performing roadside maintenance. It was daylight, raining, and the concrete road was wet. The driver of V1 lost control on the wet surface and V1 drifted to the left, crossed the left westbound lane and entered the paved shoulder. The front of V1 struck the rear of V2 in an offset mode. V1 underrode the rear of V2 and came to rest still engaged with V2. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven away. The 42-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported to a regional level-one trauma center via helicopter with severe injuries. The 55-year-old male right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported to a local hospital via ground ambulance where he was treated and released with minor injuries.
