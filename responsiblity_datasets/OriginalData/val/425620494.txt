This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 53-year-old male belted driver of a 2012 Ford Focus with non-deployed airbags. He sustained severe injuries in a crash with an embankment. The car sustained minor damage. The crash occurred during early morning daylight hours on a dry road under clear skies. A 2012 Ford Focus 5-door compact hatchback (Vehicle 1) was traveling east on a rural road with a 5% downhill grade. The bituminous road was two-way, with no lane markings. The driver of V1 lost consciousness. V1 departed the left side of the road, traveled over a shallow ditch, and impacted an embankment with its front and undercarriage (Event 1). V1 came to rest at impact and was towed due to damage. The 53-year-old male driver was using a lap and shoulder belt. The available retractor pretensioner was actuated. The vehicle was not equipped with anchor or buckle pretensioners. No airbags were deployed in the crash. The vehicle was equipped with airbags installed in the steering wheel hub, mid-right instrument panel, outboard seatbacks, and roof side rails. The driver was transported to a local hospital where he was then transferred to a trauma center for treatment of severe injuries sustained in the crash. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
