The crash occurred on an east/west roadway with shopping and business plazas on either side. The roadway had three westbound lanes, two eastbound lanes and a middle turn lane. This was a straight and level section of roadway in both directions. The bituminous roadway had a posted speed of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was dusk on a weekend. The roadway was dry and the sky was clear. It was a heavily traveled road and traffic was heavy at this time.

V1, a 1985 Buick LeSabre four-door driven by a 29-year old male, was traveling west in lane 2. V2, a 2003 Oldsmobile Alero with two occupants, was traveling west in lane 1. V1 crossed over the lane line on the right side striking the rear, left and center portions of V2 with the front right and center portions of V1. Following the impact, V2 was propelled forward into the rear portion of V3, a 2006 Mitsubishi Galant. V2 then continued traveling northwest, departing the roadway to the right, traveling over the curb, sidewalk and grass strip, and then colliding with a wooden sign with the top (roof) and front right portion of V2. V2 came to final rest underneath the sign. V1 came to rest in both lanes 1 and 2. The driver of V1 drove V1 into lane 1 in an attempt to ease traffic congestion. The movements of V3 are unknown. V3 was not towed. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 stated that he had come from his friend's home 10 minutes prior to the collision and was on his way home. The driver stated that he works two jobs and hadn't slept 20 hours prior to the accident. When questioned in depth, he admitted that he fell asleep at the wheel. He was not injured.

V2, the Oldsmobile Alero, was driven by a 45-year old female. Both she and her passenger were transported for non-incapacitating injuries. The driver of V2 stated that she was traveling at a speed of approximately 40 kmph (25 mph). She had traveled about 2 miles from her older son's home, and was taking her 13-year old son to a local restaurant when the accident occurred. She did not see V1 until the accident occurred and took no evasive actions.

V3, the 2006 Mitsubishi Galant, was driven by a 25-year old male with a 9-year old passenger. V3 was westbound in the first lane of travel in front of V2. V3 and the occupants were not on scene when the researcher arrived. V3 was not towed nor were the occupants injured. The researcher tried various times to locate V3 and its driver without success. The police report did not list a contact number and the driver was not listed in any directory.
