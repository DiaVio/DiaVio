This single vehicle rollover crash occurred at night on a divided highway with clear, dry conditions and posted speed limit of 70mph/96kmph. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu four door sedan was eastbound in lane one of the two eastbound lanes of the divided highway. The roadway curved to the left and had a downgrade when V1 began to rotate counterclockwise and crossed over lane two then departed the roadway to the left into the terrain that divided the highway . V1 slid laterally on the gravel shoulder and then down an embankment as the left side tires dug into the sandy surface tripping V1 to roll laterally to the left. V1 rolled ten quarter turns and came to final rest at the bottom of the embankment on its roof top. The driver is the case occupant and the only person in V1. This case driver, a 48 year old female, was wearing the lap/shoulder restraint and the pretensioners fired. No air bags deployed. The case driver received serious injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center. The vehicle was disabled and towed.
