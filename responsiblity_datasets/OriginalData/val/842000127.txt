The case vehicle, a 2-door 1998 Honda Civic, was exiting a public parking area traveling east and turning left (north) across a lighted five (5) lane highway of coarse asphalt on a clear evening. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Isuzu Rodeo SUV, was traveling southbound approaching the driveway junction. The case vehicle was crossing the second southbound lane of travel when the front of V2 struck the left passenger area of the case vehicle. Both vehicles then traveled southeast as a unit approximately 37 feet across the remaining three (3) lanes of travel where they came to rest with the right side of the case vehicle against the east curb of the northbound lanes. The 19-year-old male (167 cm and 47 kg) driver was unbelted, the 19-year-old male right-front passenger was also unbelted and there were no frontal-impact air bags deployed. The 15-year-old female (160 cm and 58 kg) left-rear passenger was unbelted. The driver and the left-rear passenger were taken to a local hospital with police reported 'A' injuries and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where they were enrolled as case occupants. The right-front passenger was taken to a local hospital with police reported 'C' injuries. Both vehicles were towed due to damage.
