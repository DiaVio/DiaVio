This case involves the belted 19-year-old driver of a passenger car responding to a frontal, head-on crash with a passenger van. The subject's air bag deployed and the high Delta V impact caused serious injuries. This two-vehicle crash occurred on a transition ramp of a southbound interstate to another adjacent interstate. The exit ramp had three lanes. The two (left) inside lanes continued straight while the outside lane curved right and began a long downhill, single lane. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the nighttime (dark-street lights), weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2-door sedan) was traveling northbound on the southbound ramp (wrong way). V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 19-year-old male driver (case subject, sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as evidenced by the condition the belt was found. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1988 Chevrolet G10 Sportvan) was traveling southbound on the exit ramp, having just separated from the other two lanes, and was negotiating the right curve downgrade. There were two occupants of V2. V1 had gotten onto the adjacent interstate traveling the 'wrong way' and had taken the transition ramp. This placed V1 traveling a long, straight uphill approach to the impact site. The subject (driver) may not have even realized that he was traveling the wrong way. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a head-on, distributed impact. V1's air bags deployed. Both vehicles rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest at the point of impact with V1 facing Northeast and V2 Southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The subject (driver V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury(s). The occupants of V2 were also transported due to injury.
