This case involves an 18 year old unrestrained male driver in a 2011 Ford Fusion (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual first row side airbags, and dual side curtains. The frontal driver's steering wheel mounted airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. The crash occurred on a divided highway with east and westbound lanes separated by grass, metal guardrail, and other vegetation. The eastbound travel lanes were asphalt, level and dry. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 113 kph (70 mph). V1 was traveling east in the left eastbound lane approaching a bridge. V1 drifted off the left roadside and entered the grassy median. As V1 neared the eastbound bridge, the front of V1 contacted guardrail end causing the metal guardrail to break away. V1 continued past the guardrail and contacted a fence that connected the eastbound and westbound bridges. The fence fell over onto some small saplings. The fence fell at an angle approximately 20 degrees off the ground. V1 continued over the fence and went airborne over a large ditch filled with vegetation. V1 landed on the opposing side of the ditch where its front contacted the ground. V1 came to rest in the ditch facing east. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was taken to a level one trauma center by ambulance. There he was treated for serious injuries that he sustained in the crash.
