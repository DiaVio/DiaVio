This case involves an impact to the right side of an intermediate passenger car by the front of another passenger car. The restrained 23-year-old female driver of the intermediate passenger car is the case occupant. There were no side-impact airbags available for the case vehicle. The case vehicle, a 2006 four-door Ford Taurus was northbound on a divided seven-lane traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection on the crest of a hill. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Chrysler Sebring was northbound in the same lane behind the case vehicle. The driver of V2 lost control, mounted a barrier curb on the east-side of the road, drove onto the roadside, struck a bench and a light pole and entered the east-west roadway just as the case vehicle was completing a right turn onto it. V2 struck the case vehicle on the right side. After impact, both vehicles rotated in a clockwise direction. The case vehicle then struck the curb with its left front tire, mounted the curb and struck a fire hydrant with its left side. The case vehicle came to a rest in the grassy area northeast of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 23-year-old female driver was restrained by a three-point belt. She was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. The driver sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
