This case involves an impact between the front-end of a truck based motor-home and the right side of a passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2013 four-door Toyota Camry, was westbound in the outside lane of a three-lane, dry concrete trafficway approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 truck based motor-home, was southbound on the intersecting roadway. As the case vehicle was crossing through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle on both right doors. After impact, the case vehicle rotated clockwise and impacted V2 with its front-right corner. V1 came to rest in the intersection facing north. V2 came to a controlled stop next to it. The restrained 77-year-old male right-front passenger is the case occupant. He had the benefit of deployed seatback mounted side-impact and side curtain air bags. He sustained multiple moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital. He was later transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant. The restrained 72-year-old, female driver sustained police reported non-incapacitating injuries and was medically transported from the scene.
