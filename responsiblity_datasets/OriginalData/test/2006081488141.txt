A single-vehicle collision occurred late afternoon on a Thursday. The collision occurred on a junction from a southbound freeway connecting to a northbound freeway. The ramp is a one lane, one-way roadway, on a long curve to the right. Traffic was moderate with the tail end of rush-hour commute. The pre-crash bituminous roadway is a 4% uphill grade, with a positive superelevation. The weather was raining and the roadway was wet. The ramp has a posted advisory speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). In addition to the advisory speed warning sign there are chevron curve warning signs posted along the outside curvature of the ramp

Vehicle one (V1), a 1987 Volvo 240 DL was negotiating a curve to the right in lane one at a driver reported speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), which was 16 kmph (10 mph) above the posted advisory speed. As he was negotiating the curve the vehicle began to fishtail, first in a clockwise direction. The driver tried to correct by steering left while braking and over-corrected departing the left side of the roadway and impacting the left concrete Jersey barrier with the front plane of the vehicle. V1 then bounced off the barrier and traveled backwards across the original lane of travel. V1 came to rest facing southwest on the right shoulder in the grassy area. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.

The driver of V1 is a 27 year-old male, he stated he had just got off work and was traveling to a card shop to get some new "Yu-gi-oh" cards. He was not in a hurry, but he was uncomfortable with the roadway, as he does not like this ramp when it is raining. He reported he had 12 hours of sleep the night prior, and was not fatigued, however he usually only sleeps 2-3 hours per night. He wears corrective lenses and the NASS researcher observed an undiagnosed slight hearing problem in his right ear. He reported that pushing carts at work is sometimes strenuous, however he felt rested at the beginning of his trip today. Upon inspection of the vehicle it was found that the right rear tire had only 103 KPA (15 PSI) of pressure, and was one condition for initiating the fishtailing of V1 on the ramp. The rear tires were also studded tires, which may have increased the propensity to lose traction on the wet road. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded "This vehicle loss control due to: traveling too fast for conditions", the conditions being the under-inflated right rear tire and speed of the vehicle while negotiating a sharp curve on wet roads." The critical reason for the critical event assigned to this driver is "vehicle related factor: other tire degradation."
