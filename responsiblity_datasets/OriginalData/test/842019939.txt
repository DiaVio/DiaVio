This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 74 year old male driver of a 2003 Ford Expedition XLT sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree (event 2). Vehicle 1 was southbound in the egress lane of an urban parking lot located just east of a large recreation center. The parking lot was bordered by residential roadways to the south and east. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 1 continued in a southeasterly direction through the parking lot and over the grassy perimeter. As Vehicle 1 exited the parking lot, the frontal area struck a bush resulting in minor damage (event 1). Driver steering input re-directed the vehicle in an easterly direction across the adjacent public roadway, and northeast back towards the grassy perimeter in an arced trajectory. Vehicle 1 departed the north edge of the east/west roadway and was tipped slightly forward and to the left as it descended an embankment. The front right area subsequently impacted a large diameter tree (event 2), which resulted in moderate damage. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and came to rest against the final point of impact (within the parking lot perimeter) facing east. The 74 year old male driver of the 2003 Ford Expedition was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat track adjusted to a full rearward position. The police reported that the driver was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system; however, the vehicle's event data recorder (EDR) reported the status as "unbuckled". The lack of restraint use was confirmed by the absence of loading evidence on the driver belt system, as the buckle pretensioners were also found not deployed. The first impact was minor in nature and probably produced little if no kinematic response from the driver. At impact #2, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the knee bolster and deployed driver frontal airbag. An indentation and scuff mark were identified on the left knee bolster, as the cover panel was out of place. Slight deformation was also noted to the aft reinforcement frame. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal airbag was evidenced by the smudge mark and fabric transfer documented on the membrane face. It should be noted that no rim deformation or column compression was identified. Post-impact clockwise vehicle rotation to final rest re-directed the driver kinematic to the left, evidenced by the scuff and scratch marks documented on the left front door armrest and B-pillar. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The driver was subsequently transferred to a nearby trauma center and admitted for further treatment. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
