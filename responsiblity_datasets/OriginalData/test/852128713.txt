This single vehicle rollover crash occurred at night with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck was eastbound on a two lane, two way road that had a slight downgrade and curved to the left. V1 continued straight and departed the roadway to the right tracking across the gravel shoulder and then down an embankment before the ground became level. V1 continued in a grassy field for short distance before the front right bumper contacted a guy-wire that extended up to a light pole. The front of V1 was lifted up on to the guy-wire as it began to roll over to the right. The under side of the back bumper then impacted the light pole that the guy-wire was attached to. V1 then landed on the ground with its roof top where it came to final rest facing east. V1 was damaged and towed from the scene. The driver is the case occupant and the only occupant in the vehicle. The case driver was a 24 year old male who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt with the steering column mounted air bag deploying. This case occupant was transported to the trauma center with critical injuries.
