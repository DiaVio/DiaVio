This frontal crash case involves a 36 year old restrained male seated in the front left seating position (Driver) with deployed air bag who sustained moderate injuries. The crash occurred during the early morning hours (dark, with no lights) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a bituminous two lane roadway basically straight in origin and without any intersection or traffic control device involvement. The roadway is level and is seperated by a double yellow line. The case vehicle (V1) a 2009 four-door Toyota Prius (gas/nimh) was being driven westbound and Vehicle two (V2) a 2008 BMW X5 (SUV) was being driven eastbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, crossed over the double yellow line into the path of V2 resulting in an offset frontal crash configuration for both vehicles. After initial impact, V1 rotated counter clockwise and laterally 180 degrees before traveling to its final resting position partially off the northwest road edge facing east. V2 continued traveling eastbound rotating approximately 90 degrees (CCW) impacting and a utility pole with its right side as it traveled of the east road edge. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 36 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (retractor type pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The available side seat back mounted air bag and the roof side rail mounted curtain air bag did not deployed as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned between middle and rear most and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The driver's left and right (rear) seat track were both deformed vertically (upward) due to the crash. The floor pan in this area had approximately 5 cm of vertical intrusion. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of his injuries.
