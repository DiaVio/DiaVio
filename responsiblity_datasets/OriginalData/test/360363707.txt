The case occupant is a 33 year old female front right passenger who was involved in a moderate near-side impact. This occupant was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with side impact and side curtain air bag deployments. She sustained serious injuries. This intersection crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the north/south roadway is comprised of three southbound and three northbound asphalt travel lanes, with a center left-turn only lane present. The intersecting roadway consists of one east and one westbound lane. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Lexus IS250 four door sedan, was traveling south in the inside travel lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Toyota Tundra large pickup, was traveling north in the far right northbound lane. The other two northbound lanes were occupied by vehicles stopped for traffic. V1 moved into the center turn only lane and began to make a left turn through the stopped vehicles. V1 entered V2's travel lane, and the front of V2 impacted V1's right side, resulting in the actuation of this case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of her side impact and side curtain air bags. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest in the northbound lanes, facing northeast. V2 came to final rest near the point of impact, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 33 year old female front right passenger who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her seat back mounted side air bag and right roof side rail mounted curtain deployed during the crash. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver of V1, a 27 year old female, was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated during the crash. There were no air bag deployments in her seating area. She sustained minor injuries and her treatment status is unknown.
