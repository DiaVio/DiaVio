This single-vehicle collision occurred during night hours on a weeknight. The crash scene has no artificial lighting. The crash occurred on a straight, level stretch of a two-lane, two-way, east-west, bituminous roadway. The speed limit on this roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). A narrow unpaved shoulder borders the south road edge; the north road edge has no shoulder, and a steep downhill embankment slopes into the tree line. At the time of the crash, there was snow along the roadsides, but the roadway itself was dry and free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1988 Ford Bronco II compact SUV, was traveling westbound in the first lane. An animal ran into the road. V1 veered right to avoid the animal and departed the road to the right side. V1 rotated counter-clockwise on the steep embankment and the right side of V1 struck two trees, bringing V1 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.

The 34-year-old female driver of V1 reported that she was in fair health and fatigued at the time of the crash. She takes Prozac and Amitriptyline for depression, insomnia, and migraine. She reported that she had only two hours of sleep the previous night. Fatigue was considered a factor for this driver. She said that a "critter" ran across the road, but she did not know what kind of animal it was. She veered to the right to avoid the animal and went of the edge of the road. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: Object or Animal; Animal in roadway. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded: Driver-related decision error, incorrect evasive action.
