The crash occurred at the intersection of two roadways. The east/west roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street. The north/south roadway was a two-way, two-lane undivided street, controlled by a stop sign. The posted speed in all directions was 48 kmph (30 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1997 Ford Crown Victoria taxi cab with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane one. V2, a 1995 Dodge Caravan with one occupant, was also traveling eastbound in lane one, behind V1. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection from the same direction. Although there was no eastbound traffic control signal, the driver of V2 came to a complete stop before entering the intersection. The driver of V1 did not stop in time. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. V1 came to final rest near the point of impact. V2 traveled in a southeast direction after impact, coming to final rest in an empty grass lot on the southeast corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

V1, the Ford Crown Victoria, was driven by a 39-year old female, who was transported due to injury. She stated that she was following her cousin from their house to a seamstress to get a dress made. The driver indicated that there was no stop sign at the approaching intersection, and she assumed that her cousin would continue forward. She looked down for a second to plug her cell phone into the car charger. When she looked up, she was surprised to see that the other driver had stopped. She swerved left, but was too close to avoid V2.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a driver-related recognition error, internal distraction. The driver was not attentive to the driving task because she was focused on plugging her cell phone into its charger. One associated factor for this driver was a decision-related false assumption. She assumed that the other driver was going to proceed without stopping. An experience-related factor included the driver being unfamiliar with the roadway.

V2, the Dodge Caravan, was driven by a 49-year old female, who was not injured. She stated that she was on her way from her house to the check-cashing store. The driver indicated that as she approached the intersection, she stopped for a stop sign, and was hit from behind by a taxicab. An independent witness stated that the driver was on the phone at the time of the crash, and appeared to be lost or looking for directions. The driver implied throughout the interview that she did not know the other driver, when in fact the two drivers were cousins who shared the same address. The driver also insisted many times that there was a stop sign, when in fact there was not.

Recognition-related associated factors for this driver included two distractions. The driver was talking on the phone while looking for a street address.
