Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an unbelted 55-year-old male driver, of a 2012 Chevrolet Sonic 4-door sedan, which was involved in an offset frontal impact with the frontal plane of a 2004 Honda CRV compact utility vehicle. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the late evening hours (dark, street lights present) of a winter weekend day, on a curved, two-lane, bituminous roadway. This roadway is level, but has a left turning curve for the northbound travel direction. The speed limit is 25 mph (40 km/h) and at the time of the crash, it was snowing and the roadway surface was icy. The overall environment is urban and on street parking is present at either side of the roadway. Vehicle 1, the 2012 Chevrolet Sonic 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 55-year-old male case occupant in the northbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was noted to be unbelted, but Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, driver and right front passenger knee bolster air bags, seat-back mounted side air bags for both front and rear outboard positions and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the left turning curve and continue traveling north. Vehicle 2, a 2004 Honda CRV compact utility vehicle was traveling southbound and had just entered the curved section of the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to negotiate the curve and continue traveling southbound. Crash: Vehicle 2 experienced a loss of control due to the icy roadway surface condition (snowing as well) and departed its travel lane to the left and entered the northbound travel lane. At this time, the driver of Vehicle 1 braked and steered a little right, but the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 in an offset manner. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway after rotating counterclockwise an unknown degree. As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal impact air bag deployed as did the driver's knee bolster air bag. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported as being uninjured. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash, while Vehicle 2 was driven away by its driver.
