The case vehicle a 1998 Chevrolet 1500 4x4 pickup was traveling east on a two-lane roadway when it encountered a stretch of snow covered roadway. The vehicle began to fishtail. The driver lost control and the vehicle left the road off of the south shoulder and drove off a steep embankment. The vehicle rolled to the right two-quarter turns before it impacted the decommissioned railroad (RR) roadbed at the bottom of the ravine. The roll motion was redirected due to the slope at the edge of the RR roadbed and the vehicle's oblique interaction with the slope. The vehicle rolled back to the left one quarter-turn and slid to rest on its right side before it came to rest facing south. The 26-year-old unrestrained male driver and 9-year-old female right-front passenger sustained 'B' injuries and were treated and released at a local hospital. The case occupant is the unrestrained 4-year-old female center passenger. She was partially ejected during the last quarter-turn of the rollover. The right-front frontal impact airbag was suppressed and the steering-wheel airbag did not deploy. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center at a children's hospital.
