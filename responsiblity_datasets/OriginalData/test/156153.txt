Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2009 Honda Civic, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a 4-lane, two-way road and was passing through a controlled intersection with a 5-lane, divided road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Dodge Neon, 2-door coupe was traveling west in the right through lane of this 5-lane, divided road and was passing through the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. Both V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in an oblique, L-type configuration. Both vehicles reportedly came to rest near the northwest corner of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 86-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries. The 81-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag, seat-mounted thorax air bag and right curtain air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries. The 64-year-old female left-rear passenger of V1 (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with a moderate (AIS-2) injury.
