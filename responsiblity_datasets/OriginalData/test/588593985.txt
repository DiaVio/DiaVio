Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an unbelted 34-year-old right front female passenger, of a 2012 Hyundai Sonata 4-door sedan, which was involved in a frontal impact with the back plane of a 2007 Chrysler 300 4-door sedan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the post-midnight hours (dark, but street lights present) on a summer weekend, at the intersection of a three-lane, north/south roadway and a single lane access ramp. The north/south roadway consists of one northbound lane and two southbound travel lanes, with the left southbound travel lane accommodating left turning traffic to access the single access ramp lane. The north/south roadway is straight, but leading into the crash area from the north, the southbound travel direction has a slight downhill grade. The single access ramp lane (curved) intersects the north/south roadway on the east side, forming a t-type intersection. There are no traffic controls for this intersection. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. The north/south roadway has a speed limit of 40 mph (64 km/h). Vehicle 1, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata 4-door sedan (case vehicle), was being operated by a 42-year-old male driver in the left southbound travel lane, approaching the intersection from then north. Occupying the right front seating position was the 34-year-old female passenger (case occupant). Both the driver and the right front passenger were unrestrained (no seat belt use); however, Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side impact air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to pass through the intersection and continue traveling south. Vehicle 2, a 2007 Chrysler 300 4-door sedan, was stopped in the left southbound travel lane, at the intersection. The driver of Vehicle 2 was waiting for traffic to clear in order to turn left and continue traveling east on the single lane access ramp. Crash: As Vehicle 2 waited to turn left, the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the back plane of Vehicle 2 in a rear-end collision (event 1). As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1 pushed Vehicle 2 forward and through the intersection. Vehicle 1 came to rest in the left southbound travel lane, south of the intersection, facing a southerly direction. Vehicle 2 continued in a southerly direction and eventually departed the west edge of the north/south roadway and came to a stop, facing a southwesterly direction. As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1's frontal impact air bags deployed. Post-Crash: Both the driver and right front passenger (case occupant) of Vehicle 1 were transported, by air unit, to a regional trauma center. The driver of Vehicle 1 was treated and released while the right front passenger was hospitalized with minor to critical injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured and was not transported, but three passengers within Vehicle 2 were reported to have possible incapacitating injuries and were all transported, by land unit, to a local hospital. The extent of their injuries and treatments, if any, are unknown. Both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
