This crash occurred during daylight hours at an intersection with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chevrolet Aveo four door sedan was southbound in lane two of a three lane, two way street crossing over the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1987 Ford F250 pickup truck was northeast bound in lane two of a five lane, two way street with a center left turn lane. The intersection of the streets was at an obtuse angle and not a typical right angle impact. V2 started into the intersection after being stopped when the front right corner of V1 impacted the left side front corner of V2. This impact rotated V2 clockwise just over 90 degrees and V2 then came to final rest facing south near the point of impact. Case V1 also rotated clockwise about 70 degrees and then rolled backwards to the east and came to final rest facing southwest on the east side of the intersection near the center line. Both vehicles were damaged and had to be towed. The driver and the front right passenger in V1 are both case occupants with no other passenger in V1. The driver was a 91 year old male who was not wearing the safety belt but the frontal steering column air bag deployed on impact. This case driver was transported to a local hospital before being transfered to the trauma center and then died in the emergency department. The front right passenger was a 69 year old male who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt with the pretensioner firing on impact. The frontal instrument panel mounted air bag deployed in this seated position. This case occupant was transported to the trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries.
