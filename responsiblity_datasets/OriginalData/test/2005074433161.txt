The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: false assumption of other's actions. Associative factors,driver of V1 stated that he noticed oncoming vehicle upon initiating left turn at intersection, but assumed driver would stop due to light changing yellow at the time of left turn initiation. V1 driver was not in a hurry and takes 4 different medications daily for heart and arthritis condition. Medications apparently do not interfere with driving.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line. The critical crash event was not coded to this vehicle. V2's driver made the false assumption that V1 was going to stop at intersection (yield right-of-way).
