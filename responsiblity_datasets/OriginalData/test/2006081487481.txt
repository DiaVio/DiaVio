A single-vehicle collision occurred on a weekday morning during daylight hours. The collision occurred in the northbound direction of travel of a six-lane divided highway. Traffic was moderate within the early lunch-hour commute. The pre-crash roadway is a level, and straight with bituminous paving. The roadway was wet, as it was raining. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 97 kmph (60 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Colorado pickup, was traveling northbound in lane two. The driver abruptly changed from the #2 travel lane to an exit ramp adjacent to the number one travel lane. V1 traveled across the gore area and then onto the exit ramp. The exit ramp was wet and on a positive incline. The driver failed to maintain control of his vehicle as he traveled up the ramp and departed the left side of the ramp onto the left shoulder. The driver attempted to return to the roadway and overcorrected by steering right and then the vehicle went into a counterclockwise yaw and the left side wheels dug into the soil tripping the vehicle to initiate a rollover down an ivy covered embankment. The vehicle rolled down the embankment to the left 4 quarter-turns and came to rest on its wheels on the embankment facing East-Northeast. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1 is a 27 year-old male who report to be in good health with no hearing restrictions. He does have a corrective lens restriction on his license, and he was in compliance, as he had his glasses on; his sight is corrected with glasses. He was on his way to pick up his daughter from his mother in law's house; he was not in a hurry as he stated he still had plenty of time to get there. He was well rested, as this day was his day off and he had slept in. The driver of V1 stated that traffic ahead of V1 began changing lanes in order to avoid hitting something in the road. He stated that his vehicle hit the object and then the vehicle started to shake. His vehicle then shot over (towards the right shoulder) and then started up the off ramp. The witness to the crash stated it looked as though the driver of the blue truck realized at the last second that he was about to miss his exit. The witness, who was driving the bus in the number one lane, said the driver of the pickup just barely missed hitting the left front of his vehicle. He also stated that the driver had climbed out of the truck, and then he put on his shoes, as he must have been driving down the road with no shoes on. While on-scene the researcher observed a soft drink and a bag of fast-food in the vehicle as the driver was retrieving these items from the truck. During the vehicle inspection the tire pressure was measured and the three undamaged tires were under-inflated from the recommended tire pressure by 21 to 34 kPa (3 to 4 psi). Under-inflated tires on the wet roads would adversely affect the handling capabilities of the vehicle if it started to hydroplane or fishtail on the wet road. There were no observations by the NASS researcher from the vehicle inspection that the vehicle had impacted any objects. The police report does not indicate an impact with an object in the sequence of crash events; it indicates the first event in the sequence was this driver departing the road.

The physical evidence from the crash supports the witness statement. This evidence indicates that at a high rate of speed for the conditions, the driver changed from the #2 travel lane to the #1 lane. Then the vehicle went across the gore area and onto the exit ramp, which was wet and on an incline. The driver failed to maintain control of his vehicle as he traveled up the off-ramp and eventually departed the left side of the ramp onto the left shoulder. The driver attempted to return to the roadway and over-corrected by steering right and then the vehicle went into a counterclockwise yaw and the left side wheels dug into the soil tripping the vehicle to initiate a rollover down an ivy covered embankment.

Due to the sudden lane change by the driver of V1 and just missing an impact with the bus, aggressive driving was considered a factor for him. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle control loss due to- traveling too fast for conditions. V1 driver realized at last minute that he almost missed his exit & was traveling too fast for the lane change on the wet roadway. The critical reason for the critical event assigned to V1 is a driver related decision factor: too fast for curve/turn. The driver realized too late he needed to exit the freeway and was going at too great a speed on the wet roadway for the sharpness of the turn he was attempting to make onto the off-ramp. He ended up going over the gore area and failed to maintain control of the vehicle resulting in a rollover. Associative factors for the driver are aggressive driving, poor directional control and overcompensation.
