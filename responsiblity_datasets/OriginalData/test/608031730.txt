This case involves a primary front-end impact to the case vehicle and a rear-end impact to a parked bus, resulting in serious injuries to the unbelted 36-year-old female driver. The case vehicle, a 4-door 2000 Honda Accord was southbound in the outside lane of a divided four-lane trafficway. It was daylight, the roadway was dry and there was no adverse weather. A legally parked transit bus was 'laying-over' at a bus stop. As the case vehicle approached the bus, it was too far into the parking lane and the front of the case vehicle struck the back of the bus in an off-set mode. The case vehicle under-rode the back of bus approximately one meter before it came to a rest facing south. The case vehicle was towed from the scene. The bus drove away. The sole occupant was the 36-year-old female driver. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center. The case vehicle was towed due to damage.
