This case focuses on a 62 year old restrained female driver in a 2014 Honda Accord sedan. V1 was equipped with dual side curtains, dual seatback-mounted airbags and dual frontal airbags. All airbags deployed during the crash with the exception of the passenger's frontal and side airbags. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry, asphalt, four-lane, two-way roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was attempting to negotiate a left curve while traveling westbound in lane one of the roadway attempting to pass a non-contact vehicle. V1 entered the left lane at a high rate of speed and when the driver attempted to maneuver her vehicle back into the original travel lane, she lost control of her vehicle. The driver steered right and applied her brakes in an attempt to regain control, but was unsuccessful. V1 began a clockwise yaw as it departed the roadway. The left front of V1 contacted a ditch. V1 continued to rotate clockwise after the impact with the ditch. V1 tripped on the ground with its left side leading. V1 went across a gravel drive and continued to roll down an embankment that was located adjacent to the gravel drive. V1 rolled two full turns (eight quarters) before coming to rest on its wheel while remaining on the roadside. During the roll V1 contacted a small sign with an unknown plane. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver was transported from the crash scene by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and treated for moderate injuries that she sustained during the crash.
