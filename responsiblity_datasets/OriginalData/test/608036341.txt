The case vehicle, a four-door 1999 Dodge Intrepid was northbound on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt roadway. It was dark and there was no adverse weather. The case vehicle crossed the center line, drove off of the left edge of the road, went down an embankment, side-swiped a small-tree with its left fender and side-swiped a small tree with its right-rear door and right quarter panel before it impacted a 38-cm tree with its left-front end. The case vehilce rotated counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees before it came to rest facing west. The vehicle was towed due to damage. The 33-year-old male driver was the sole occupant and was not restrained by a thee-point belt, but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and later enrolled as a case occupant.
