This case involves a passenger car that collided with a minivan in an oblique, left, off-set frontal mode. There are two case occupants, the restrained driver and the unrestrained right-front passenger. The case vehicle a 2013, four-door, Hyundai Elantra was traveling south in the inside through lane of a dry, concrete, five-lane, divided traffic-way approaching an obliquely oriented four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Chevrolet Uplander minivan was traveling in the northbound lane of the same trafficway approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was entering the intersection, V2 made a left-turn into the path of the case vehicle. The front of V2 struck the front of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise and V2 to rotate counterclockwise. Consequently, the left side of the case vehicle struck the right side of the V2. V2 came to rest in the northwest corner of the intersection facing northwest. The case vehicle came to rest straddling the median for the southbound channelized right-turn lane and the roadway facing northwest. It was daylight and clear. The restrained 32-year-old male driver and the unrestrained 33-year-old female right passenger both had the benefit of deployed frontal impact air bags. In addition, the driver had the benefit of deployed seat-back mounted and roof side-rail side-impact air bags. Both occupants sustained multiple moderate injuries, were transported to level-one trauma center and enrolled as case occupants.
