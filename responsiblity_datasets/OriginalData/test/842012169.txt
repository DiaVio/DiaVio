This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 38 year old female driver of a 2005 Toyota Rav4 ("S" model), 4-door 4x4 sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a frontal collision with a 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager SE minivan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was southbound and had just exited a left curve approximately Â½ mile north of its initial approach. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed Vehicle 1 to cross the centerline, into the path of the southbound Plymouth. Upon recognition of the impending harmful event, the driver of Vehicle 1 steered right in an attempt to re-enter the northbound lane. As Vehicle 1 entered the southbound lane, the front impacted the front of Vehicle 2 (full frontal configuration) resulting in moderate damage. Upon impact, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and came to rest across the centerline facing northeast. Vehicle 2 rotated counterclockwise and rebounded to final rest (in the southbound lane) facing southeast. The restrained 38 year old female driver of the 2005 Toyota Rav4 was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-track position. Restraint usage was confirmed by the extensive loading evidence documented on the driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. At impact, the driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual restraint, knee bolster, and deployed driver frontal airbag. Heavy scuff marks and indentations were identified on the left knee bolster, with deformation noted to the aft reinforcement frame. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal airbag was evidenced by the smudge marks and makeup transfers documented on the face of the membrane. At this point, the driver loaded through the deployed airbag and deformed the steering wheel, evidenced by the 5 cm of upper rim displacement and 3 cm of column compression identified on these components. A pronounced scuff mark was also documented on the steering column, as column movement measured 4 cm vertical (up), and 3 cm lateral (left). Following the crash, the driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and admitted for treatment. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
