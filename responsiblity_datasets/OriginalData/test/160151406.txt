This near-side crash involves a 42-year-old restrained female passenger with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injury. This crash occurred during daylight hours under dry and clear conditions. The collision occurred at the intersection of two seven lane, two-way trafficways controlled by a traffic light. Both trafficways were divided by raised concrete medians into one-way roadways. The case vehicle (V1), a 2007 Chrysler 300 sedan, was traveling south in lane two of a four lane roadway and was approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Toyota Highlander utility vehicle, was traveling eastbound in lane three of a four lane roadway and was approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when both vehicles attempted to pass straight through the intersection. This caused the front of V2 to strike the right side of V1. After the initial impact, the left side of V2 sideswiped the right side of V1 before both vehicles came to final rest in the southeast portion of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 46-year-old male who was restrained by the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had his steering wheel mounted air bag deploy. The case occupant, a 42-year-old female, was sitting in the right front seat and was properly wearing her three point lap and shoulder belt. Her instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed during impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a local hospital for treatment and then later transferred to a level-one trauma center for definitive treatment.
