This case involved the belted, driver and front right passenger of an SUV (util. veh.) responding to a right side leading rollover, interrupted by a wooden utility pole. This single vehicle crash occurred on a curving road traveling through a mountainous area. The north/south trafficway had a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. The northbound approach presents a downhill grade with a left curve-straight section-right curve profile. The right (east) roadside consisted of a level dirt shoulder on the outside of the left curve, the left (west), dirt shoulder was bordered by a 2.5m upward, steep-faced dirt embankment. The embankment became more-shallow as the road curved right. At the point of incident there was a large rock/boulder and a 30cm wooden utility pole just to its north. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway was dry during this morning (daylight) weekday crash. The case vehicle (2002 Ford Explorer, 2-door w/ hatch SUV) was traveling northbound, downhill on its approach to a left curve. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 16-year-old male driver (case subject 1) and 17-year-old male front right occupant (case subject 2) were determined to have been using the belt restraints. As the driver, traveling downhill, began to negotiate a left curve he ran off of the right roadside, onto the dirt shoulder. The driver traveled a distance on the shoulder, parallel to the roadway, with eventually both right and left side wheels on the shoulder. The driver steered the vehicle to the left in an extreme manner, resulting in the vehicle entering into a counterclockwise yaw as it traveled back across the roadway, rolling over as it exited the opposite side of the roadway, colliding into a dirt embankment. The vehicle continued to rollover but did not mount the embankment on its first couple of impacts with it. However, as the embankment became shallow, the vehicle mounted it and struck down a barbed wire fence before striking a 40cm wooden utility pole. The impact sheared the pole in half approximately 2-3 meters above the ground. It could be presumed that the vehicle became airborne as a result of traveling over (striking) a large rock/boulder that was just in front of the pole. The vehicle came to rest just beyond the pole impact, on its wheels facing northwest. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The driver was transported to as trauma facility and was pronounced deceased as a result of injuries from this crash. The front right seat passenger was transported to a trauma facility with 'severe' injury(s).
