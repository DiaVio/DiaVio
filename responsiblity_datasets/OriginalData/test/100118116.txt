This case involves a belted 46-year-old female driver of a passenger car responding to a 'moderate' frontal impact (air bag assisted) with a boulder. The subject sustained serious injury as a result. This single vehicle crash occurred on the westbound side of a four-lane, divided interstate traveling through a mountainous area. The two westbound lanes had a left curvature and a downgrade. The right (north) roadside consisted of a paved shoulder, a wider level gravel shoulder and then a downward embankment dotted with large boulders. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the mid-day, weekday crash. The case vehicle (2003 Kia Rio, 4-door sedan) was traveling westbound in the number-one (right) lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 46-year-old female driver (case subject) was using the belt restraint. There were two additional passengers, a 14-year-old female was seated on the front right seat and was also using her belt restraint. An 11-year-old male was seated on the second row, right side seat and was reportedly not using the belt restraint. She allowed the vehicle to travel off of the right side of the roadway. The vehicle struck a large rock situated at the edge of the trafficway with its front plane, off-set right. The vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact dislodged the rock and moved it as the vehicle rotated clockwise and continued down the embankment backwards. The vehicle struck a large rock at the bottom of the embankment with its back plane and came to rest on its wheels facing east. The subject (driver) was transported to a local medical center before being transferred to a trauma facility due to serious injury(s). The front right seat passenger and second row right side passenger were also transported to the local medical center due to less serious injuries.
