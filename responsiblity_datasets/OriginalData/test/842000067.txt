The Case vehicle, a 2003 Toyota Sequoia, was being driven South by the case occupant, a 56-year-old female, 162 cm (5'4") in height and 77 kg (170 lbs). She was restrained by a 3-point restraint system and driver's air bag which deployed on impact. The accident occurred on a state rural paved (coarse asphalt) road on a clear day at approximately 1048 hours. As the case vehicle entered an intersection with another 2 lane rural road, it was struck on the left side at the left front wheel by a 2002 Toyota 4-Runner traveling west. The case vehicle rotated slightly clockwise as it departed the intersection in the southwest quadrant. As it departed the roadway, it went through a dirt depression and came to rest just short of the woodline after going up a slight incline. The second vehicle rotated counter-clockwise before coming to rest in the southwest quadrant of the intersection. The case occupant had police reported incapacitating injuries. The case occupant and driver of the second vehicle were transported to the hospital from the scene by ambulances.
