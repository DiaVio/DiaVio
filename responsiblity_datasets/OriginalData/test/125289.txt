Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Toyota Highlander, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling on a one-lane, two-way, private residential driveway in a rural community. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 (lone occupant) had reached the end of the driveway when she realized that she had forgotten something at the house. The driver of V1 backed in reverse down approximately one-quarter mile of this winding, wooded driveway when she lost control, drove of the left side of the road and struck a tree with the rear of V1. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and immediately transferred via air to a regional level-one trauma center.
