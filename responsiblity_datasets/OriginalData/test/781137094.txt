This case involved the belted female front right seat passenger of a compact car responding to a frontal impact with a guardrail. The, 11 o'clock principal direction of force, impact caused 'moderate' vehicle damage and resulted in serious injury to the subject. This single-vehicle crash occurred on the southbound side of a multi-lane interstate. There were four lanes for southbound travel and an exit lane to the right. There was a concrete center divider in the median and a guardrail off the right (west) roadside. The roadway was straight and level at the crash location. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (2002 Volkswagen New Beetle, 2-door sedan) was traveling southbound in the number-two lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts. Originally equipped with first row frontal-impact air bags, this vehicle had been in a previous crash where they had deployed and had not been replaced. It is presumed that the first row seat back mounted side-impact air bags were still available. There were two occupants in the vehicle. The 18-year-old female driver and the 26-year-old female front right seat passenger (case subject) were both determined to have been using the belt restraints based on physical evidence. The driver had been proceeding straight when, for an undetermined reason, steered sharply to the left across the number three and four lanes, left the roadway into the median and struck the concrete center divider with its front left. The glancing impact caused the vehicle to veer away from the divider as the left back of the vehicle scraped it again. The vehicle continued, out of control, back across the southbound lanes on a southwest diagonal trajectory as it began to rotate clockwise. The vehicle ran off of the west side of the roadway where it struck the guardrail with its front. This was the primary impact in the crash in terms of vehicle damage severity. The vehicle rotated slightly clockwise and came to rest against the guardrail facing west. The vehicle was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. Both occupants were transported to a trauma facility due to varying degrees of injury, the subject sustaining the more serious.
