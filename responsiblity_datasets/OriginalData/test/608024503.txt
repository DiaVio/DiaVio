The case vehicle, a 4-door 2005 Dodge Neon was southbound on a two-lane asphalt roadway with a 4% downgrade. For an unknown reason, the driver lost control of the vehicle and it entered a counter-clockwise yaw, crossed the centerline and departed the roadway off of the east side. The right-front wheel struck a large rock embedded in the ground, causing the vehicle to trip and roll right-side leading. As the vehicle was entering its second quarter-turn, it struck a 30-cm tree. The vehicle rotated clockwise around the tree and a low hanging branch struck the right-front door. The case vehicle started to roll left-side leading back onto its wheels. The case vehicle struck a 10-cm tree with its right fender before it came to rest on the roadside facing southeast. The case vehicle was towed from the scene. The 18-year-old male driver was unrestrained, but the 18-year-old male right-front passenger was wearing a three-point belt. There were no air bag deployments. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with severe injuries and enrolled as a case occupant. The right-front passenger was transported to a local hospital with police reported incapacitating injuries.
