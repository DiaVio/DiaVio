This case involves a right side (far-side) impact of a passenger car with a minivan. The restrained 78-year-old male driver and the 77-year-old female right front passenger of the passenger car are the case occupants. None of the available air bags at driver position deployed. The case vehicle, a four door 2007 Volkswagen Passat was northbound on a wet, level, divided six-lane asphalt road approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. It was dark, but lighted and raining. Vehicle two (V2), 2005 Ford Freestar minivan was westbound on the intersecting divided eight-lane road approaching the same intersection. The traffic signals were flashing a yellow signal due to an interruption of power. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, it was struck on the right side doors by the front of V2. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate clockwise. The case vehicle came to rest at the north end of the intersection, straddling the southbound left lanes facing northeast. V2 came to rest south of the case vehicle facing east. The 78 year-old male driver was wearing a belt restraint, but none of the available air bags deployed. The only other occupant of the case vehicle was 77-year-old female right passenger. She was wearing a belt restraint and the seatback mounted and right curtain air bags deployed. The driver sustained multiple moderate injuries and the right-front passenger sustained severe injuries. Both were transported to a level-one trauma center and both enrolled as case occupants.
