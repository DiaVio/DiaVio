This near-side impact case occupant is a 36 year old male driver, restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, with side impact and side curtain air bag deployments, who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Volkswagen Tiguan compact utility vehicle, was traveling eastbound in lane one of a two lane, one way, curved freeway on-ramp. Vehicle two (V2), a 2011 Freightliner Cascadia 113 cab-behind-engine tractor pulling one trailer, was southbound in the westernmost lane of the three lane, one way freeway. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt freeway lanes are straight and level, while the asphalt on-ramp lanes have a downhill grade and curve to the right. There is a paved median that separates the two prior to the merge point. As V1 was negotiating the curved on-ramp, the driver lost control and departed the roadway to the left. V1 traveled up and over the median and then traveled onto the freeway lanes. The front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of his side impact and side curtain air bags. Both vehicles traveled south from the point of impact and V2 came to final rest facing south in lane one. V1 came to final rest in lane one, facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 36 year old male, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's outboard seat back mounted side and left roof side rail mounted curtain air bags deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was taken to the trauma center where he was hospitalized for 15 days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The driver and front right passenger in V2 were not injured.
