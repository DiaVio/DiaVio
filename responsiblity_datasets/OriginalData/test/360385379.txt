This frontal crash case involves a 21 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Chevrolet Aveo four door sedan, was northbound in lane one of a two lane, two way asphalt roadway. Adjacent to the travel lanes are grassy areas, followed by trees. In V1's precrash area the northbound lane curves to the left and has a level grade. V1 was negotiating the curve when it crossed over the southbound lane and departed the roadway to the left. V1 traveled over the grass, and the front of V1 impacted a tree, resulting in the actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of her frontal air bag. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest facing southwest with its front end off the roadway and its back end in the southbound travel lane. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 21 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. This driver sustained serious injuries, was transported to the trauma center for treatment, and was hospitalized for four days. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
