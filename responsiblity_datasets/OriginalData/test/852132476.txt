This single vehicle crash occurred on a two lane, two way highway where the roadway curved to the left with a down grade. At the time of the crash it was dark, but lighted and it was snowing with the roadway surface covered with snow and slush. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota RAV4 compact utility vehicle, was eastbound on the roadway and lost control in the curve and began to rotate counterclockwise crossing the opposite lane and then departed the roadway to the left. V1 then impacted the end of a guard rail directly into the right side front passenger door. V1 then began to rotate clockwise down a steep embankment beyond the guard rail and began to roll toward the driver's side when the back of V1 impacted a tree and then the top of V1 impacted a second tree into the hood and windshield. V1 came to final rest against both of these trees as the left side partially then contacted the ground. V1 was disabled and towed. The case occupant is the front right passenger who was a 42 year old male and was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver, a 53 year old female, was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt was reported to have no injuries. No other occupants were in V1.
