Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Mercury Sable, 4-door wagon was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a five-lane, two-way road (two lanes northbound, center bi-directional turn lane, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 International tractor, pulling one trailer was traveling south in the right southbound lane. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the asphalt road surface was dry. For an unknown reason (possible seizure), the driver of V1 relinquished control of her vehicle and V1 drifted to the left, crossing the left northbound lane, center turn lane, left southbound lane and into the right southbound lane. The front of V1 struck the left-rear axle of V2's trailer. V1 continued in a northerly direction and came to rest in the right southbound lane facing north. V2 came to a controlled stop in the right southbound lane, facing south. Both vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 62-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel and seat-mounted air bags depoloyed. She was transported via air ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
