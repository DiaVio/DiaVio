This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 46 year old female front right passenger of a 1998 Toyota Camry. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a frontal impact with a 1999 Honda Accord (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a multi-lane divided highway traveling on the inboard lane. The north and southbound lanes were separated by a narrow grass median and W-beam guardrails. It was dark (not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 2 was southbound in the northbound lanes, traveling on the inboard lane. The vehicles impacted in a full frontal configuration, resulting in severe damage. Vehicle 1 came to rest in the (northbound) inboard lane facing northeast, as Vehicle 2 came to rest across the deliniation line facing southeast. The restrained 50 year old male driver, and 46 year old female front right passenger (case occupant) of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local hospital. The driver of Vehicle 1 received an unknown level of treatment. The front right passenger of Vehicle 1 was subsequently transferred to a trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The case occupant was 61 kg (135 lbs) in weight and 157 cm (62 in) in height. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
