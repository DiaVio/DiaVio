This case involves a right side (far-side) impact with a passenger car followed by a frontal impact in an off-set mode to the left between a passenger car and a mini-van. Both impacts were minor. The unrestrained 19-year-old female driver is the case occupant and the available steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. The case vehicle a five-door 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser was westbound on a dry, level two-lane concrete road approaching four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Buick LeSabre was southbound on the intersecting two-lane road, traveling in the left one-way traffic lane. Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Toyota Sienna minivan was southbound in the right one-way traffic lane. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, it was struck on the right side doors by the front of V2. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate clockwise. The case vehicle rotated into the path of V3 and the front-left corner of V3 struck the front-left corner of the case vehicle. The case vehicle entered a counterclockwise yaw and came to rest straddling the southbound lanes facing west-southwest south of the intersection. V3 came to rest south of the intersection in its original travel lane. V2 came to rest in the southeast quadrant of the intersection facing west. The case occupant was first sent to an outside hospital and then was transferred to a level one trauma center. The 19-year-old female driver was not wearing a belt restraint and the frontal-impact air bag did not deploy. She was the only occupant of the case vehicle. The driver sustained severe injuries, was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
