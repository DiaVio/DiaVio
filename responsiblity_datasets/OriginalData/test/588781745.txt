Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 53-year-old female driver of a 2012 Toyota Prius v 4-door hatchback, which was primarily involved in a narrow corner (small overlap) frontal impact with the frontal plane a 2010 Mitsubishi Lancer 4-door sedan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the late morning hours (daylight) of a summer weekend day, on a curved, two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally east and west and has a negatively graded left turning curve for the westbound travel direction. A guardrail is present at the north roadside edge and the speed limit for this roadway is 40 mph (64 km/h). At the time of the crash, it was raining and the roadway surface was wet. The overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2012 Toyota Prius v 4-door hatchback, was being operated by the 53-year-old female driver in the westbound travel lane, approaching the crash area from the east. The driver of Vehicle 1 was unbelted, but Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, driver's knee bolster air bag, side hip/torso air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the graded left turning curve and continue traveling westbound. Vehicle 2, a 2010 Mitsubishi Lancer 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound, approaching the crash area from the west. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to negotiate the graded right turning curve and continue traveling eastbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 2 drifted left as it negotiated the right turning curve and partially entered the westbound travel lane. At this time, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 in a small overlap type impact (corner to corner - event 1). As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise while being pushed slightly rearward. At this time, the right back corner of Vehicle 1 struck the guardrail at the north roadside edge (event 2) before coming to rest facing a southwesterly direction. Vehicle 2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest near Vehicle 1, but primarily in the eastbound travel lane, facing a northerly direction. As a result of the first event, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag, driver's knee bolster air bag, driver's side hip/torso air bag and roof side rail curtains deployed. Post-Crash: The driver and sole occupant of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The driver and sole occupant of Vehicle 2 was reported to have sustained non-incapacitating injuries, but was not transported from the scene. The extent of their injuries and treatment, if any, are unknown. Both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
