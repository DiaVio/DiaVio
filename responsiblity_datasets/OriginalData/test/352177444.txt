Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 17-year old, male driver, of a 2001 Mazda Tribute compact utility vehicle, which was involved in a severe, offset frontal impact. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This three-vehicle collision occurred during the mid-afternoon hours (daylight), of a winter weekday, on a straight, two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally east and west and has an uphill grade for the eastbound travel direction. Just prior to the crash area, the westbound travel direction has a hill crest. At time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was reportedly dry. The speed limit for this roadway is 45 mph (72 km/h). Vehicle 1, the 2001 Mazda Tribute compact utility vehicle, was being operated by the 17-year old male driver (case occupant), in the westbound travel lane. Vehicle 1 was traveling an unknown distance behind Vehicle 3 just prior to the crash. The case occupant was utilizing his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt (with buckle pretensioner) and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with frontal impact air bags and front, outboard, side impact air bags. Vehicle 2, a 2000 Chevrolet Express conversion van, was traveling east, ahead of Vehicle 1, in the eastbound travel lane, approaching the crash area from the west. Vehicle 3, a 1983 Chevrolet C-25 pick-up truck (with trailer), was traveling westbound, ahead of Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 3 intended to continue traveling west. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 2 entered the westbound travel lane, traveling east. As a result, Vehicle 2's frontal plane struck the left side plane of Vehicle 3 and its trailer (event 1 / unknown severity). Vehicle 2 subsequently struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 with its frontal plane in an offset manner (event 2). As a result of this impact with Vehicle 1, Vehicle 2 rotated counterclockwise and rolled onto its right side plane (event 3) before coming to rest. Vehicle 3 eventually came to a stop west of the impact area, while Vehicle 1 is believed to have rotated counterclockwise an unknown degree before coming to rest. As a result of its impact with Vehicle 2, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed and the driver's buckle pretensioner actuated. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by air unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital with incapacitating injuries. The driver of Vehicle 3 was reported to be uninjured. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash, while Vehicle 3 was driven from the scene by its uninjured driver.
