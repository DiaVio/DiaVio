This two-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekend. The crash occurred on a straight stretch of a three-lane, two-way, north-south, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. A two-way left turn lane separates northbound and southbound traffic, and the speed limit is 40 kmph (25 mph) in both directions. A parking lane borders the outside lane of each travel direction, and business parking lots are along both roadsides. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford E350 van, was traveling southbound in the left turn lane, about to turn left into a private drive. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford Focus four-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the first lane, approaching V1's position. As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles rotated clockwise and came to rest in the northbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 24-year-old male driver of V1 reported that he did not see V2's approach prior to executing the turn. He reported that he paused midway through the turn and looked right as he heard the screeching of tires. He tried to accelerate out of the way, but could not move in time. The critical precrash event for V1 was: This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded: Driver related recognition error, inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).

The 29-year-old male driver of V2 reported that he saw V1 approach with the intention of turning left, but he assumed that V1 would remain stopped and allow him to pass. The critical precrash event for V2 was: Other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over left lane line. The critical reason for the event was not attributed to V2.
