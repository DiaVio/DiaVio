This case involves an oblique impact between the front-end of a passenger car and a parked passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2007 four-door Ford Fusion, was eastbound on a two-lane, dry, level, asphalt roadway with a parking-lane on both sides of the street. It was dark, but lighted and clear. The case vehicle crossed into the westbound lane, into the west parking-lane and struck a parked 2007 Toyota Camry with its front end. The impact pushed the 2007 Toyota Camry into a parked 2000 GMC Yukon XLK behind it. The case vehicle came to rest facing east in the west parking-lane. The unrestrained 77-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. He was in a non-optimal posture pre-impact due to a syncopal episode. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
