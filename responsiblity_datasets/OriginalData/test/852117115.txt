This crash occurred on a two way, two lane highway during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. The posted speed limit was 50mph/80kmph. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Hyundai Accent, two door hatchback, was travelling in the eastbound lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 1976 Chevrolet El Camino, two door auto-based pickup truck, was westbound in the eastbound lane passing vehicle three (V3), a intermediate size sedan, travelling in the westbound lane. V1 and V2 then impacted head-on and V1 was forced immediately post impact rearward and to the south down a steep embankment and ditch. The right rear tire and lower sill of V1 impacted the ground when it came to final rest facing east in the ditch. V2 post impact with V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side of V2 impacted the left side of V3. This forced V3 to rotate counterclockwise and cross over the eastbound lane ahead of V2 before it departed the roadway to the south into a large gravel shoulder coming to rest facing east. V2 continued to rotate counterclockwise and came to rest in the westbound lane facing southeast. All vehicles were towed from the crash scene. The case occupant was the driver of V1, a 24 year old male who was wearing a manual lap and shoulder belt and the frontal air bag deployed. The vehicle was equipped with a seat back side impact air bag in the driver position that did not deploy. No other occupants were in V1. The case occupant was transported to the trauma center.
