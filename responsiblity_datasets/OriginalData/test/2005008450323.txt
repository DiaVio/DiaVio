This crash occurred during the evening hours of weekday on a two-lane bituminous suburban roadway. The dark, wet roadway was level with a curve to the left and featured a speed limit of 56kmph (35mph). The atmospheric conditions were cloudy with rain.

V1, a 1990 Honda Accord hatchback, was westbound negotiating the left-hand curve traveling approximately 97kmph (60mph). As the road straightened back out, the driver continued with the curve and ran off the road to the left. V1 struck a parked car (V2 a 1999 Nissan Altima) on the side of the road, continued forward striking a retaining wall, which sent the vehicle airborne and into the side of a house. V1 came to final rest in the fist floor of the two-story residence. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1 and 97 kmph for V2.

V1 was driven by a 19 year-old male who could not be located for an interview. The driver sustained non-incapacitating injuries and was transport to a treatment facility after he was extracted from the vehicle. V1 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the road edge to the left. The Critical Reason was a driver decision error, traveling too fast for conditions. The associated factors were traveling too fast for conditions (unknown reason), as well as the atmospheric and roadway conditions (the rain made the curved roadway wet and slippery).
