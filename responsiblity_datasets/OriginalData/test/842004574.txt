This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 49 year old female driver of a 2005 Honda Pilot LX 4-door sport utility. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) sustained minor back damage as a result of a rear-end collision with a 1995 Ford Windstar GL minivan (Vehicle 2). The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. Vehicle 1 was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The case vehicle was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side impact air bags for the front outboard seating positions. The driver frontal air bag and right front side impact air bag deployed (unknown if resulting from event 2 or 3). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on the inboard lane a multi-lane divided interstate highway and slowing for traffic congestion ahead. Vehicle 2 was eastbound behind Vehicle 1, and approaching from the rear. It was dark (street not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The rear right area of Vehicle 1 was impacted by the front left area of Vehicle 2 resulting in minor damage (event 1). This initial impact initiated a counterclockwise rotation as Vehicle 1 began its post-impact trajectory to the northeast. Vehicle 1 traveled laterally and the right side wheels began digging into the asphalt pavement. This tripping mechanism initiated a 4-quarter turn right side rollover, which resulted in moderate top damage (event 2). During the rollover sequence (between quarter turns 2 & 3), Vehicle 1 departed the left (north) shoulder as the left side surface impacted a concrete barrier resulting in moderate, non-horizontal damage (event 3). Vehicle 1's counterclockwise rotation continued as it re-entered the eastbound lanes where it came to rest. Vehicle 1 was reported by police as coming to rest upright across the eastbound travel lanes facing northeast. Vehicle 2 also came to rest in the eastbound lanes facing northwest. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
