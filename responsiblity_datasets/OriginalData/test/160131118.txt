Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan Altima sedan, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was negotiating a curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, was traveling north in lane one of the same roadway, negotiating the same curve to the right. For unknown reasons, V1 crossed the center line entering the northbound lane where the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. This impact caused V1 to roll over two quarter turns to the left, departing the roadway to the east side in the process and coming to final rest off the roadway to the east on its roof. After impact with V1, V2 also departed the roadway to the east side where it came to final rest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1 (and case study occupant), a 32-year-old female, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her B-pillar mounted pretensioner and steering wheel mounted frontal air bag both deploy. The driver of V1 was entrapped by the instrument panel and the left front door being jammed and after a 25 minute extrication was transported to a level-one trauma center by helicopter.
