Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford F250, crew cab pickup truck was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the dirt road was snow-covered. The driver of V1 reportedly entered a right curve with too much speed and V1 departed the left side of the road. The front of V1 struck a small sapling tree on the roadside and and then entered into a dtich which is one meter lower than the road surface. As V1 entered this ditch, V1 was pitched approximately fifteen degrees to the left and the upper left side of V1 struck a small tree growing on the left side of the ditch embankment. V1 continued along this ditch and the front of V1 struck and uprooted another tree. V1 came to rest on top of this tree. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 40-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 13-year-old male center-front passenger was not using the available two-point lap belt and was also transported to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries. The 40-year-old female right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and was not injured. The 38-year-old male left-rear passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and was not injured. The 17-year-old male right-rear passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries.
