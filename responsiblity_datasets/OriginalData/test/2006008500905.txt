This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a four-lane roadway divided by a grass median (two northbound and two southbound lanes). The roadway was concrete, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred late in the evening on a weekday, the roadway was illuminated by streetlamps, and heavy rain was falling.

V1 was a 2002 Ford Focus four-door sedan with 5 occupants. V1 was driven by a 25-year old male. V1 was traveling southbound when it began to hydroplane on the wet road. During the hydroplane the driver noticed a vehicle to his left. The driver steered to the right to avoid striking the vehicle. V1 skidded off the roadway to the right and then down an embankment, where it began to yaw counterclockwise. The right rear passenger door struck a tree, and this impact reversed its rotation around the tree and the vehicle tires then dug into the ground and V1 rolled over. It completed two-quarter turns and came to rest on its roof. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was overcompensation, a performance error. The driver admitted he had been traveling slightly over the speed limit, and so excess speed was coded as an associated factor. Additional associated factors coded to this driver include conversation with the passengers, unfamiliarity with the roadway, the weather (rain) and the wet roadway.
