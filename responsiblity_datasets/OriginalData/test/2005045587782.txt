The crash occurred on a rural east/west two-lane road that is intersected by a church parking lot on the south side. The road is straight and level with a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45mph). Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekend afternoon.

Vehicle #1 was a 1997 Ford F-150 pickup traveling east. Vehicle #2, a 1999 Buick Century, was attempting to turn left out of the parking lot. Vehicle #1's front struck the left side of Vehicle #2. The F150 (V1) came to rest facing northeast in its original lane. The Buick (V2) came to rest facing north across both lanes. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 33-year old male that was unbelted with deployed frontal airbags. He had minor injuries but wasn't transported for treatment. The driver stated that the other vehicle began to turn left directly in front of him leaving little time for avoidance. The pickup left 10m of pre-impact skids.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was other vehicle encroaching from driveway turning into opposite direction. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. No associated factors contributing to the crash were assessed to the pickup (V1).

Vehicle #2 was operated by a 76-year old female that was belted with deployed frontal airbags. She was treated and released from a local hospital with incapacitating injuries. She stated that she looked left and then right before attempting to turn left and didn't see the other vehicle until impact. It appears she stopped and looked each direction but didn't initiate the turn rapidly enough after doing so. The EDR data was retrieved from the vehicle and indicated she stopped before taking her foot off the brake and hitting the throttle between -4 and -3 seconds before algorithm enable. Her speed was up to 17.7kmph (11mph) at 40% throttle -1 second prior to AE. The maximum longitudinal delta V in the side impact was 16.3kmph (10.16mph).

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was this vehicle turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a recognition error, inadequate surveillance. The driver of Vehicle #2 looked but did not see V1. There were no other associated factors coded to this driver.
