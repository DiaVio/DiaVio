Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an unbelted 33-year-old male driver of a 2014 Ford Focus 4-door sedan, which was involved in a narrow corner, frontal impact, with the right side plane of a 2014 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the late post mid-day hours (daylight) of a spring weekday, at the intersection of a two-lane, bituminous east/west roadway and a two-lane, bituminous, north/south roadway. The east/west roadway is straight and level with a speed limit of 55 mph (89 km/h). The north/south roadway is level but is curved leading into the intersection (curved left for the northern leg) with a speed limit of 30 mph (48 km/h). The intersection has traffic control signage for both the northern and southern legs, while the east/west roadway has no traffic controls. At the time of the crash, it was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. The overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2014 Ford Focus, was being operated by the 33-year-old male driver (case occupant) in the eastbound travel lane, approaching the intersection from the west. The driver and sole occupant of Vehicle 1 was not utilizing the available 3-point, lap/shoulder belt, but Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat-back mounted side air bags (front, outboard positions), roof side rail curtains and a driver's knee bolster air bag. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to pass through the intersection and continue traveling east. Vehicle 2, a 2014 Toyota Corolla 4-door sedan, was stopped in the southbound travel lane, at the northern leg of the intersection. The driver of Vehicle 2 was waiting for east/west traffic to clear in order to pass through the intersection and continue traveling southbound. Crash: As west bound traffic became congested at the area of the intersection, Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 1 entered the intersection. The frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the right side plane (front section) of Vehicle 2 (event 1). Vehicle 1 was redirected towards the southeast corner of the intersection where it departed the roadway and traveled down and along a drainage ditch area adjacent to a farm field, where it came to rest, facing an easterly direction. Vehicle 2 was also redirected towards the southeast corner of the intersection where it came to rest, facing an unknown direction (thought to be southeasterly, but unconfirmed). As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag, driver's knee bolster air bag, driver's side hip/torso air bag and the left roof side rail curtain air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by air unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries, while the driver of Vehicle 2 was transported by land unit to a local hospital with non-incapacitating injuries. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
