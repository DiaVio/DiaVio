This case occupant is a 27 year old male driver who was involved in a frontal impact and was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the pre-dawn dark hours in the northbound lanes of a divided state freeway and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Dodge Magnum four door hatchback was northbound in lane one of three one way lanes. There are paved asphalt shoulders on both sides of the travel lanes. On the east side of the travel lanes there is a sloped grassy embankment, and a metal guardrail, located just east of the freeway shoulder. V1 drifted onto the right shoulder and off the east road edge, continued north for approximately 30.5 meters (100 ft) before the front of V1 impacted the south end of the guardrail. Then a straight section of this guardrail broke off and impacted V1 inside the front left bumper corner area, embedded itself inside the left front tire area and then punched into this driver's toe pan. The guardrail section continued into this driver's seating area and ripped through the floorpan below the left front seat. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest off the freeway, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage and it took two tow trucks to dislodge V1 from the guard rail. The driver of V1, a 27 year old male, was the sole occupant and was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal impact air bag deployment. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
