This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 71-year-old female belted driver of a compact utility vehicle with a deployed front airbag. She sustained serious injuries in a frontal impact to a large tree. The case vehicle incurred severe damage. The crash occurred during mid-morning daylight hours on a dry road under cloudy skies. A 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was traveling northeast on a two-way, two-lane rural road negotiating a left curve. The bituminous road was on a 7% uphill grade with 7% superelevation in the curve. V1 reportedly encountered a deer in the road and swerved right in avoidance. V1 departed the right side of the road. V1 traveled a short distance in the east roadside before striking a tree 40 cm in diameter with its front plane (Event 1). V1 came to rest at the point of impact with the tree and was towed due to damage. The 71-year-old female driver was belted at the time of the crash as evidenced by extensive belt payout and loading to the D-ring. The available retractor pretensioner did not show evidence of actuation, as the retractor operated normally at the time of inspection. The buckle pretensioner was not actuated, although the unoccupied right front passenger seat buckle pretensioner was actuated. No anchor pretensioners were installed. The steering wheel hub and right top instrument panel airbags deployed at impact. The available curtain airbags did not deploy. No other airbags were installed. This occupant was transported to a hospital before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. No other occupants were in the vehicle.
