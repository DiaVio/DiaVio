The crash took place 78 meters from the end of the gore of a one-lane northbound interstate entrance ramp. The north/south interstate had two lanes in each direction divided by a concrete barrier wall. The entrance ramp did not end, adding a third lane for northbound traffic. There were 2-meter shoulders present on the east and west sides of the travel lanes. Conditions were daylight and dry on a weekday evening. The posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph).

Vehicle #1 was a 1996 Chevrolet Blazer traveling north on the entrance ramp. The driver merged into the center northbound lane and lost control. Vehicle #1 began to rotate clockwise, crossing the far-left lane and 2-meter shoulder before contacting the center concrete barrier wall with its left back. After impact, the vehicle continued to rotate clockwise and rolled over onto its left side 13 meters from initial wall contact. The Blazer slid on its left side 56 meters northward in the far left lane, coming to rest facing northwest straddling the emergency and far left travel lane with its front against the wall. The sport utility vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 21-year old male that was belted with no deployed airbags. Fortunately, he was not injured in the collision. In his statement to the NASS researcher and police, he claimed that another vehicle made contact with him causing the loss of control, but his account changed several times and was not deemed credible. A witness stated that Vehicle #1 lost control without making contact with any other vehicles. Police charged the driver with failure to maintain control of vehicle.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was overcompensation. One additional associated factor coded to this driver was excess speed, as it was believed that the driver was going too fast to maintain control of his vehicle.
