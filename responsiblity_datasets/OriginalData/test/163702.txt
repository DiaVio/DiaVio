The case occupant is the 163 cm, 127 kg (5 ft 4 in, 280 lb), 49-year-old female driver of a 2002 Ford Mustang, 2-door coupe that lost control on the icy road surface and struck a tree on the right-front door. The impact was classified as severe and the WinSMASH reconstruction program calculated a delta-v of 46 km/h (29 mph) which appeared to be low when compared to the observed vehicle damage. The case occupant was using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. On impact she moved to the right, relative to the interior of the vehicle, in response to the 3 o'clock direction of force. She sustained multiple head and brain injuries from head contact with the tree as she was deemed to be partially ejected. These injuries include a left subdural hematoma, left subarachnoid hemorrhage, bilateral frontal lobe contusions, intraparenchymal contusions, a basilar skull fracture, a right vault fracture, right orbital blowout fracture, and a nasal bone fracture.Her condition deteriorated and she died from her injuries 4 days post-crash.
