This case involves the unbelted male driver of a passenger van responding to a head-on collision with an SUV. The 12 o'clock impact resulted in severe vehicle damage, deployed the driver's frontal-impact air bag and serious injuries to the subject. This two-vehicle crash occurred at the four-way intersection of a three-lane, undivided, north/south trafficway and a two-lane east/west trafficway in a rural area. The north/south trafficway had a single lane for travel in each direction and a designated left turn lane separated by painted double yellow lines. The intersection was controlled by stop-signs at the east and west approaches. The weather was clear and the bituminous trafficway dry during the night-time (dark, not lit), weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2005 Dodge Caravan, 4-door passenger van) was traveling northbound on its approach to the intersection intending to travel straight through. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal-impact air bags. The 42-year-old driver (case subject/sole occupant) was not using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2000 Ford Expedition) was traveling southbound on its approach to the intersection intending to turn left. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously as V2 attempted to negotiate a left turn, and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in mid-turn. The impact caused V1's steering hub mounted frontal-impact air bag to deploy. V1 rotated clockwise, as it deflected V2 counterclockwise, and came to rest facing southeast in the northbound lane just north of the impact. V2 was re-directed to its left (east) and came to rest off of the northeast corner facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a local medical facility and then transferred to an area trauma facility.
