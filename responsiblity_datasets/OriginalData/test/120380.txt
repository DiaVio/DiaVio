Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Hyundai Sonata, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the left westbound lane of a two-lane, one-way freeway segment and was approaching an interchange where this road merged with a three-lane, one-way road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the right westbound lane of the three-lane, one-way road and was approaching the interchange where this road merges with the two-lane, one-way road. Vehicle three (V3), a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the middle westbound lane of the three-lane road and approaching the same interchange. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. As V1 reached the convergence area, the driver merged suddenly to his left and into the path of V2. The driver of V2 was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the left-rear of V1 in an oblique, L-type configuration. This impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 250 degrees while continuing to travel downstream and partially enter the lane that V3 was traveling in. The driver of V3 was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V3 struck the right-rear of V1 in an L-type configuration. Final resting positions of the three vehicles are unknown but all three vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 54-year-old male driver of V2 (lone occupant) was not injured and did not seek any medical attention. The 58-year-old male driver (lone occupant) of V3 was transported to a regional level-one trauma center where he was treated and released (ISS-1). The 39-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant & lone occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt. His steering-wheel air bag did not deploy but the seatback-mounted, head & torso side-impact air bag deployed. He was transported to a regional level-one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment.
