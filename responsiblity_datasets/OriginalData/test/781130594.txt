This case involves the belted 69-year-old female front right seat occupant of a passenger car responding to a head-on impact with a pickup. The subject's frontal impact air bag deployed. The subject sustained serious torso, pelvic and ankle injury in the 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact with a vehicle damage severity rating of 'moderate'. This two-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, undivided, north/south trafficway traveling through a rural area. The northbound approach to the crash site was straight while the southbound approach had a sweeping right curve. The trafficway was relatively level in spite of the pronounced super-elevation of the curve, especially southbound, as it transitioned. The weather was clear and the bituminous trafficway dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2004 Ford Escape, 4-door utility vehicle) was traveling northbound on the straight and level roadway. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. There were two occupants in V1. The 71-year-old male driver and the 69-year-old front right seat passenger (case subject) were both using the belt restraints. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2005 Chevrolet Colorado, p/u) was traveling southbound, in a right curve. V2, apparently, crossed (left) over the double yellow center lines while negotiating the right curve and reacted by steering to the right. V2 traveled off of the right roadway and steered again to the left. This maneuver brought V2 into a counterclockwise yaw as it slid back across the roadway, into the northbound lane, and thus, into the path of V1. The front plane of V1 struck the front plane of V2. V1's air bags deployed. The impact deflected V1 to the right (CW) approximately 45-degrees, while V2 rotated sharply counterclockwise. The right rear wheel of V2 and the left rear wheel of V1 collided in a second (sideslap) impact. Both vehicles came to rest within close proximity of the point of impact with V1 facing northeast and V2 facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. Both occupants of V1 (case subject is front right seat passenger) were transported to a trauma facility due to varying degree of injury, 'serious' for the case subject.
