This case involved a 62-year-old male driver of a compact passenger car responding to a near-side impact with another passenger car. The nine-o'clock principal direction of force impact crash caused 'moderate' vehicle damage while resulting in serious injury to the subject. This two-vehicle crash occurred in the westbound lanes of an eight-lane, divided, interstate. The weather was clear and the straight, level, bituminous trafficway dry during the nighttime (dark-not lit), weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2001 Saturn SL, 4-door sedan) was traveling westbound in the number-one (right) lane. The vehicle's first row lap and shoulder belts were pretensioner equipped and there were first row frontal-impact air bags, which did not deploy during the crash. The 62-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, as evidenced. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1991 Toyota Camry, 4-door sedan) was traveling westbound in the number-three lane. The driver of V1 (case subject) steered the vehicle left, abruptly, for unknown reasons. The vehicle responded by entering into an ever-increasing counterclockwise yaw as it continued, now southwest, across the adjacent lanes and into the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1, centered rear of the B-pillar. As the vehicles separated, V1 continued counterclockwise rotation and the left front of V1 struck the left front of V2. V1 came to rest a few meters beyond the impact site straddling the south roadway edge line facing southeast. V2 was deflected left, and into a counterclockwise yaw, at separation of the vehicles. V2 continued southwest and came to rest adjacent to V1 facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. Both drivers were transported to a trauma facility due to varying degrees of injury with the subject's being the most severe.
