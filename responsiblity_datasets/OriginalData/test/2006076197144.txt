This single-vehicle crash occurred on a two-lane, two way, undivided asphalt roadway in a rural area with various curves and elevations. In the area of the crash, the northbound lane curves right and is downhill. The radius of curvature is 450 meters (1476 feet) with a super elevation of 4%. The speed limit drops from 88 kmph (55 mph) to 72 kmph (45 mph) just prior to the initial road departure. The crash occurred during late afternoon on a Saturday with no adverse weather or road conditions present.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Tundra pickup with one occupant, was northbound in the curve when it departed the right road edge with its right tires. The driver then steered left and re-entered the roadway, then crossed both lanes of travel to the left before the driver steered right. The vehicle rotated clockwise, departed the right road edge where the front of the vehicle contacted a near vertical rock embankment. The vehicle then rolled 4-quarter turns to the left and came to rest on its wheels partially on the northbound lane and the northbound shoulder facing east. The vehicle was towed from the scene. The driver received minor injuries but refused medical treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 31-year-old male, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Test results showed a blood/alcohol concentration of 0.30. The driver stated to police that he steered to avoid a deer in the road. The first right road edge departure was too gradual to substantiate his claim since the departure was at a shallow angle. His over-correction to the right after returning to the roadway caused him to exit the right side again and impact the embankment. The driver refused to be interviewed.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: poor directional control.
