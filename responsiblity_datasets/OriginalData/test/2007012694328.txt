This crash occurred at night at the beginning of the week. It occurred in an intersection controlled by a traffic signal light. The east/west roadway had 4-lanes of travel, two in each direction. The lanes were marked with lane arrows. The roadway was dry, straight, level asphalt. The weather was clear. The roadway speed was posted at 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle #1, a 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier 2-door, was traveling east. V1 was driven by a 17-year old female. At the 4-way intersection, V1 stopped for a red light with the intention of turning left at the intersection. On the opposing side of the intersection, there was a large SUV in lane #2, also waiting to turn left. When the signal turned green, traffic began moving, with the exception of the vehicles making left turns. The driver of V1 could not properly see around the stopped SUV in the opposing lane. When she thought that all vehicles going straight westbound had cleared the intersection, she started to turn left. As she crossed over the first westbound lane, the driver saw Vehicle #2, a 1999 Chevrolet express van coming at her in the first westbound lane of travel. The driver of V1 accelerated in an attempt to move out of V2's path; however, the front of V2 struck the right passenger door and the front panel of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise onto the northwest corner of the intersection where it came to final rest facing southeast, partially off the roadway. V2 traveled straight through the intersection and came to final rest in its original lane of travel. The driver of V1 received minor injuries from the impact and face lacerations from flying glass. This driver was transported to the local trauma center by ambulance. The driver of V2 was not injured in the crash. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage and V2 was driven away by its driver. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 reported that she was in good health and did not take any medications. She did report that she wears contact lenses for far-sightedness. She said she was on her way to a friend's home at the time of the crash. She stated that as she approached the intersection in lane #2 she wanted to make a left turn. She stated that there was a large SUV-type vehicle in lane #2 of the oncoming traffic-way. She stated that it was hard to see around the vehicle and thought that oncoming traffic was clear and started her turn.

A 38-year-old female drove V2. She reported that she was in good health but does suffer from rheumatoid arthritis but taking no medication for the condition at this time. She also stated that she does not wear corrective lenses. She stated that while at a college class her caregiver called and said that her son was ill and thought she should come home as soon as possible. She stated as she drove home along the roadway in lane #1 she was thinking of her son and what might be wrong with him. She stated that she did not drive this roadway often but was driving it on this night going to her temporary home (her home burnt the week before). She stated that was also on her mined. She stated that as she approached the intersection there was a large Tahoe-type vehicle in lane #2 making a left turn. She stated that she could not see any vehicle in the #2 eastbound lane. As V1 made its left turn, she then saw it as it crossed her path. She applied the brakes but struck V1, rotating it clockwise onto the northwest corner for final rest. She stated that she just let her vehicle travel to final rest in lane #1 westbound.
