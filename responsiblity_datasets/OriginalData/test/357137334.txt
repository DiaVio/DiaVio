This case involves a front-end, under-ride impact between a passenger car and the rear end of a tractor/trailer combination. The 31-year-old male driver is the case occupant. He was restrained by a three-point belt, but the steering-wheel airbag and the belt pretensioners did not deploy. The case vehicle, a 2005 four-door Ford Focus hatchback, was travelling in the center southbound lane of a divided, dry, level, six-lane, asphalt road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Freightliner Tractor/trailer, was southbound in the same lane. It just completed a right turn onto the road from an intersecting roadway. It was daylight and clear. The case vehicle struck the rear end of the trailer in an off-set mode to the left. Both vehicles came to rest in the center southbound lane facing south. The 31-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He refused medical transport from the scene, but later went to the emergency room at a level-one trauma center where he was admitted with qualifying moderate injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
