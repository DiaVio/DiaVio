This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the eastbound lanes of an eight-lane, divided, urban roadway near an intersection. The east/west roadway consisted of four lanes in each direction (three straight lanes and a left turn lane in the eastbound direction) divided by a tree-lined median. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and a 4% downhill grade. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Ford E250 van, was eastbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Buick Park Avenue sedan, was eastbound in lane three ahead of V1. Vehicle three (V3), a 2002 Toyota Corolla sedan, was eastbound in lane two ahead of V1. Vehicle four (V4), a 1999 Honda Accord, was eastbound in lane four several car-lengths ahead of V1. Vehicle five (V5), a 2006 Jeep Liberty, was eastbound in lane two also several car-lengths ahead of V1. Vehicle six (V6), a 1997 Acura CL 3.0, was eastbound in lane one ahead of V1. Vehicle seven (V7), a 2000 Ford Explorer, was eastbound in lane one directly behind V6. All seven vehicles were decelerating for a red stoplight ahead at the intersection. Police Reported Travel Speed is 69 kmph for V1 and 69 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1 passed out and his vehicle subsequently traveled right into lane two. The passenger in V1 grabbed the steering wheel and steered hard left crossing back over lane three into lane four. V1 was than steered back into lane three where its right front corner struck the left plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 then continued right into lane two where its front impacted the rear of V3 (Event 2). V1 continued pushing V3 until V3 traveled into lane four whereupon V3's front impacted the right side of V2 (Event 3). V2 was subsequently pushed into the bushes in the median with its front plane (Event 8). V1 came to rest with its front against the rear plane of V3, and V3 with its front against the right plane of V2. V4 impacted the left plane of V1 with its front (Event 4) and came to rest at impact.

The erratic movement of V1 caused a series of crashes in lanes one and two between vehicles five, six, and seven. None of these three vehicles had any contact with vehicles one, two, three, or four. V5, which was traveling in lane two, steered into lane one contacting the left plane of V6 with its right plane (Event 5). This action caused V6 to slow down and be struck in the rear by the front plane of V7 (Event 6). V5 came to rest in lane one further down the road. V7 then traveled past v6 on the right and lost control, rotating counter-clockwise 120 degrees. V6 struck the left plane of V7 with its front (Event 7) before both vehicles came to rest in the roadway.

The driver of V1, a 30-year old male, was transported to a local trauma center with minor injuries. He stated that he felt like he was going to pass out and begin pulling to the right so his passenger could take over. He passed out before he could safely exit the roadway. He estimated his traveling speed to be 56 kmph (35 mph). The Ford van was towed, but not due to police-reported damage.

He stated that he was heading to the nearby hospital to visit a family member when he heard a crash behind him and just started steering left to get off the road. He estimated his travel and impact speeds to be 8 kmph (5 mph). The Buick sedan was not towed due to damage.
