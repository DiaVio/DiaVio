This crash occurred on a freeway at night with no street lights. The weather was clear, but the concrete surface was wet . Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado four door pickup truck was eastbound in lane one of three one way lanes of a divided freeway that had a slight upgrade. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Nissan Xterra four door wagon was westbound in the opposite direction also in lane one. The full front of V1 impacted head-on into the full front of V2. The scene evidence was not to scale, but appeared that V1 overpowered V2 rearward as both vehicles slightly rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in lane one. Both vehicles were severly damaged and towed from the crash scene. The case occupant was a 36 year old male who was wearing an integrated lap/shoulder seat belt and the front steering column mounted air bag deployed. The driver had moderate injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
