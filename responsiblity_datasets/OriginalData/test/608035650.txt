The case vehicle a four-door 1999 Toyota Camry was south-bound in the left-turn lane of a dry, level, asphalt five-lane roadway, at a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) was traveling in the northbound curb lane approaching the same intersection. It was dark, but lighted and there was no adverse weather. The driver of the case vehicle made a left turn across the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right-side of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise approximately 180 degrees before it came to rest facing west in the eastbound lane of the east leg of the intersection. V2 traversed the intersection drifting to the right and came to rest after mounting the barrier curb facing north straddling the northbound curb lane and the road side. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The unrestrained 46-year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. No air bags deployed. She was transported to an outside hospital with serious injuries. She was subsequently transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
