This two-vehicle crash occurred in the eastbound lane of a two-lane roadway: one each east/westbound roadway several hundred feet before a two-way north/southbound "T" intersection. The east/westbound lanes were non-physically divided; only double yellow lines divided the two lanes. There were no signalized traffic control devices at this middle of the block location. The bituminous covered roadways were dry, level, and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred on a weekend during the early evening daylight hours. The roadway was free of any noticeable defects and the traffic flow was normal for this roadway.

Vehicle one, 2007 Dodge Nitro compact utility van, was traveling eastbound in lane one of the two-way roadway when it traveled off-road to the right. Vehicle two, a 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix 4-door sedan was legally parked on the south curb edge. V1's right front tire contacted V2's left back and ramped up the side and V1 rolled over on its left side. V1 continued on its left side several feet, rotating clockwise and contacted with its front left tire the southeast curb edge of the "T" intersection where it came to final rest continuing to face eastward on its left side. Vehicle one damages were disabling and it was towed from the scene. Vehicle two's damages were moderate and it remained legally parked. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The driver of vehicle one, a 61-year old male, said he was traveling eastbound on his way home from picking up food from a fast food store. His travel speed was approximately 56 kmph (35 mph). He explained how he must have had a diabetic seizure/blackout. He saw the roadway ahead of him and the parked vehicle to his right. But, suddenly everything went black and he ran into the parked vehicle. The events afterwards were explained to him because he did not come out of the blackout until he was being assisted out of his vehicle, now on its left side, by medics. He'd just got his vehicle out of the repair shop two weeks ago from his involvement in a previous crash two months ago. Sadly, he said, 'I guess, I'm getting too old to drive'. He hasn't had a diabetic seizure in a long time. He's been 100% disabled for over twelve years and retired as a result. He is familiar with this roadway, which he travels on daily. He's been a licensed driver for more then forty years. Reluctantly, he said he would have to discontinue driving. He was treated at the scene by medics. However, refused to be transported to the hospital because of insurance concerns.
