This two-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday on a westbound interstate. The multi-lane divided interstate consists of four westbound and three eastbound lanes with a cable-tension guardrail in the grass median dividing the two directions. The concrete roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The conditions were daylight, clear and sunny at the time of the crash.

V1 and V2 were both westbound in lane two going straight. V1, a 2007 International tractor with a trailer loaded with scrap metal, was behind V1 with its driver being the sole occupant. A non-contact tractor-trailer was in lane three next to V2, a 2001 Ford Focus with one occupant. The driver of V2 swerved to the right when she thought that the truck to her left was merging into her lane. The driver of V2 then jerked the wheel to the left and lost control, spinning 180 degrees and re-entering lane two where it was struck head-on by V1. V2 was pushed off the right side of the roadway where it came to rest and a fire started under its hood. V1 also continued off the right side of the roadway where it came to final rest against an embankment. V1 and V2 were both towed from the scene but only V2 received disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1 and 97 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1 was a 37-year-old male who was making a delivery when he was involved in this crash. He stated that he left the plant/scrap yard 15 minutes earlier and was traveling west in lane two, behind a white Ford Focus (V2), when another westbound tractor-trailer in lane three began to merge into his lane. He reported that the other tractor-trailer had its turn sign on before it attempted to change lanes and that V2 was probably in its blind spot. He believed V2's driver panicked when it saw the other tractor-trailer with its turn signal on because she swerved sharply to the right and slammed on her brakes, causing her car to spin 180 degrees and back into his lane. The front of tractor struck the front of V2 and the two drove off the right side of the road. This driver was not injured in the crash.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded other vehicle encroaching from adjacent lane - over right lane line. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. No associated factors were coded to the driver of V1.

The driver of V2 was a 29-year-old female who reported that she was traveling west in lane two when a tractor-trailer from lane three entered her lane and clipped the front of her car. She said her car spun out of control and she was struck again by a different tractor-trailer, which pushed her car off the road and onto the grass roadside where her car caught fire.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded this vehicle control loss due to a combination of over-steering and braking. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded incorrect evasive action. Associated factors coded include performance errors: panic and overcompensation.
