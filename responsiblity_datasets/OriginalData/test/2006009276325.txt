This crash occurred in the early afternoon of a weekday in the middle of a four-way suburban intersection. The intersection consisted of a north/south, five lane (with lane three serving as a left turn lane) curved roadway and an east/west four-lane roadway controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. The bituminous roadways both had a posted speed limit of 48kmph (30 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1988 Volvo 240 Station wagon, was westbound in lane three approaching the intersection where it intended to turn left. V2, a 1994 Plymouth Acclaim, was westbound in lane two approaching the same intersection where it also intended to turn left. As the light changed from yellow to red, V1 entered the intersection and began its left turn. The front right corner of V2 struck V1 on the right side. Both vehicles came to a rest in the middle of the intersection not far from the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 was driven by an 18-year-old female who reported no injuries. She stated that she went through the light when it was yellow and that V2 must have run the light. She did admit to looking left where she intended to turn as she entered the intersection.
