This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 61 year old female driver of a 1998 Nissan Altima GXE sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions (non-deployed). The case vehicle sustained moderate left side damage as a result of an oblique angle impact with a 1996 Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a one-way multi-lane municipal street approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle 2 was westbound on approach to the same intersection. It was daylight, with rainy conditions as the roads were wet. As both vehicles entered the intersection, the frontal area of Vehicle 2 impacted the left side surface of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage (event #1). Vehicle 2 came to rest in close proximity to point of impact facing southwest. Vehicle 1 continued on its post impact trajectory into the southwest sector of the intersection where it departed the right (west) pavement edge. As Vehicle 1 departed the west pavement edge, the front right area struck a brick wall resulting in minor damage (event #2). At this point, Vehicle 1 was redirected back onto the roadway (south sector) where it came to rest in the southbound lanes facing south. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The driver was 65 kg (143 lbs) in weight, and 162 cm (64 in) in height. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage as Vehicle 2 was driven from the scene.
