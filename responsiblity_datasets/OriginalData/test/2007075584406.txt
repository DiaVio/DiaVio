This single-vehicle crash occurred on a six-lane roadway, divided by a depressed grassy median. There were three lanes in each direction. This was a right curve, 6% downhill, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). It was early evening on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear and the traffic flow was moderate

Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Ford Explorer four-door SUV with one occupant, was in lane three negotiating the curve. The driver lost control and crossed all the westbound lanes to the right and departed the roadway off the right side of the road. The vehicle entered a ditch, which caused it to rollover four-quarter turns. The vehicle came to rest in the ditch facing southeast on its wheels. V1 was towed from the scene with extreme damage to the right side. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

V1 was driven by a 22 year-old male, who reported no injuries. He stated he was in the right lane and was cut off by a non-contact vehicle. He also stated he went across all lanes of traffic and back across them again before running off the right side of the roadway. The researcher however feels the driver, not from this area, was driving the speed limit, but feels he was driving too fast to negotiate the curve. The vehicle inspection revealed the two right side tires tires were overinflated by 69 kpa(10 psi), the left rear tire was underinflated by 41 kpa (6 psi), and the left front was flat. The tread depth on the tires was good. The driver just got back to this country after being deployed over seas. He and some friends had just left the barracks to get gas. They were traveling in a caravan to Las Vegas for fun and then home in another state. He was well rested and does not take any medication. He is near-sighted with a light prescription and was wearing his glasses.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve. There are associative factors which include, not being from this area, failed to look far enough ahead, combination of insufficient steering and braking, panic, uncomfortable with general traffic speeds, inexperienced driver, tires with improper inflation and poor directional control.
