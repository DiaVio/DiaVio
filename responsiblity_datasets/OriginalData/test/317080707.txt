This case involves a 45 year old unrestrained female in a 2008 Toyota Camry four-door sedan (V1). The other vehicle in the crash is a 2003 Honda Accord four-door sedan (V2). V1's frontal driver and passenger airbags and the driver's knee airbag deployed during the crash. The crash occurred at a three leg intersection with five north/south lanes. There was a right turn lane for the southbound side and a left turn lane on the northbound side. It was daylight and cloudy at the time of the crash. The dry asphalt roadway was straight and level. There were no traffic controls for the north/south lanes and the posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph). V1 was traveling south in the left lane approaching the intersection with the intention of traveling straight through. V2 was northbound in the left turn lane attempting to turn onto the intersecting roadway. As V2 turned left, it was struck in the right side by the front of V1. V1 rotated approximately 200 degrees counterclockwise and came to rest in the southbound lanes on the far side of the intersection. V2 rotated counterclockwise and traveled off the southwest corner of the intersection for final rest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment of her injuries.
