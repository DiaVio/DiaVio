The focus of this case is on a 78-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2007 Honda Accord (V1), involved in a collision with a tractor trailer. This two vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of a winter weekday (Thursday), on a straight level section of a three lane divided highway with positive median barrier. This bituminous roadway runs north and south. The weather was cloudy and the roadway surface was wet. The speed limit for the east/west roadway is 97 km/h (60 mph). The 78-year old male driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the right most southbound travel lane. He was wearing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt. The driver frontal air bag did not deploy, but the side thorax air bag and curtain air bag did deploy in this event. For unknown reasons, V1 lost control on the wet pavement and departed the right most southbound travel lane to the left - crossing in front of a 2001 Freightliner Classic tractor trailer (V2) that was traveling in the center southbound lane. V2 attempted to avoid contact with V1 by changing lanes to the left into the leftmost travel lane. V1 continued across the center lane and entered the leftmost lane in front of V2. The front right corner of V2 contacted the front left side plane of V1 The impact on V1 caused it to rotate clockwise and the rear of the left side plane of V1 contacted the right side of V2. V1 continued in a clockwise yaw across the center and right lanes - coming to final rest across the right fog line half in the right lane and half on the paved shoulder facing in a southwesterly direction. V2 came to rest in the left shoulder. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported by ground to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
