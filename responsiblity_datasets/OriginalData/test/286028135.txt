This case involves a moderate right side impact resulting in head injuries to the unrestrained 18 month old male rear right passenger (case occupant). The collision occurred at a 4-legged intersection of a north-south and an east-west roadways. The roadway traveling in the east-west direction is a two-lane, two-way roadway with in-laid trolley tracks and bicycle and parking lanes on either side. The north-south two-lane, two-way roadway meets the east-west roadway at an angle of approximately 45 degrees south of the intersection, and then becomes true north north of the intersection. The north-south roadway has on-street parking on both sides and a dedicated left turn only lane in the north leg of the intersection. The intersection is controlled by a traffic light, and illuminated by overhead street lights with additional lighting from nearby businesses. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash, and the asphalt roadway was dry and level. Vehicle 1 (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan, was traveling east. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2006 Toyota Tundra compact pickup, was traveling north. The crash occurred when V2 failed to stop at the red light and entered the intersection as V1 was attempting to proceed straight through. The front plane of V2 impacted the right side plane of V1. After impact, V1 rotated to the left approximately 120 degrees and came to rest in the northeastern corner of the intersection facing southwest. V2 came to rest in the northern leg of the intersection facing north. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. V1 was driven by a 34 year old female who was restrained by the lap/shoulder belt and the frontal airbag. She sustained back pain and was transported by EMS to a local trauma center. In the right front seating position was an 11 year old female restrained with the lap/shoulder belt and frontal airbags. She sustained lacerations to her chest and left arm. In the left rear seating position was an 6 year old male who was restrained by the lap/shoulder belt. He sustained a hematoma and neck pain. In the center rear seating position was a 4 year old male restrained using the lap belt only. He was not injured in the crash. In the right rear seating position was a 15 year old female restrained using the lap/shoulder belt. She sustained contusions only. Additionally in the right rear seating position was an 18 month old male (case occupant) who was held on the lap of the 15 year old female and was otherwise unrestrained. He sustained scalp lacerations and a right temporal bone fracture with embedded glass. The 1.5, 4, and 6 year old occupants were not seated in the appropriate restraints for their age and weight. All pediatric occupants were transported by EMS to a local pediatric trauma center. V2 was driven by a 35 year old male with unknown restraint status. He was not injured in the collision.
