This case involves an impact between a passenger car and a SUV. The case occupant is the driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2007 four-door Toyota Matrix was travelling east on a dry, level, asphalt, two-lane road approaching a three-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer was travelling in the inside southbound lane approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was making a left turn, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle forward of the A-pillar. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise and V2 to rotate counterclockwise, resulting in a 'side-slap' impact between the left side of the case vehicle and the right side of V2. After this impact, the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the inside southbound lane, facing east-northeast. V2 rotated clockwise, departed the road off the east side and came to rest facing west-northwest, straddling the sidewalk. It was daylight and cloudy. The restrained 55-year-old male and restrained 51-year-old female right-front passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. Both had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact air bags. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
