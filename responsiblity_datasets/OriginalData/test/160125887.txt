Vehicle One (V1), a 2000 Toyota Avalon sedan, was traveling north in lane two of a four lane roadway under dry, daylight conditions with a wet roadway approaching an intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2000 Ford E250 Van, was traveling west in lane two of a five lane roadway approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles started to cross through the intersection and the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. This impact rotated V1 counterclockwise and the left of V2 side slapped the right side of V1. V1 then skidded off the road to the northwest, coming to rest in the northwest corner of the intersection. V2 rotated slightly clockwise before coming to rest in the northwest portion of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case study occupant and driver of V1, an 85-year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and no airbags deployed in V1. The right front passenger in V1, also a case study occupant, was a 77-year-old female who was also wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. Both occupants in V1 were transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
