The case vehicle, a 2001 Chevrolet Monte Carlo 4-door sedan was northbound on a two-lane asphalt roadway. Vehicle two (V2) a 1991 Buick Regal 4-door sedan was southbound on the same roadway. Vehicle three (V3) a 2005 Honda Civic 2-door coupe, was northbound traveling behind the case vehicle. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The driver of V2 was overtaking a non-contact vehicle slowing to make a right turn. In order to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle, the driver of V2 veered to the left, crossed the center-line and entered the path of the case vehicle. The front-end of V2 struck the front-end of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise away from the point of impact about 80 degrees, before it came to a rest mostly in the northbound traffic lane. V2 continued to move forward and rotated about 20 degrees counterclockwise before coming to rest in the mouth of a driveway. The driver of V3 witnessing the collision between the case vehicle and V2, veered to the left to avoid a collision, but was not successful. The front-end of V3 end-swiped the back-end of the case vehicle, resulting in a paint transfer to the rear bumper of the case vehicle. V3 crossed the center-line and came to a rest on the west shoulder. The case vehicle and V2 were towed due to vehicle damage. V3 was driven away from the scene. The 47-year-old female driver was restrained by a three-point belt. 80-year-old female right-front passenger was unrestrained. They were the only occupants of the case vehicle. The steering-wheel and top mounted instrument panel air bags deployed. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and was enrolled as a case occupant. The right-front passenger was transported to a level-one trauma center with critical injuries and died in the trauma bay.
