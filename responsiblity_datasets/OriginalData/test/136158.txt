Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Malibu LS, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The elderly driver of V1 reportedly lapsed into a semi-conscious state, possibly due to low blood sugar, and relinquished control of the vehicle. V1 drifted off the right side of the road and the front of V1 struck and knocked down a mailbox. V1 then returned to the road and crossed into the eastbound lane narrowly missing an eastbound vehicle. V1 then returned to the westbound lane, continued off the right shoulder and struck another mailbox with the front of V1. V1 continued off the right side of the road and sidswiped a tree with the right-side of V1 before striking another tree with the front end. V1 came to rest against these trees. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 80-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance with critical injuries to a regional level-one trauma center where he died from his injuries. The 72-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was tranported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries.
