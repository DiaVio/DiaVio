This moderate severity single vehicle rollover crash involved a 75 year-old male driver who was restrained with the lap/shoulder belt with no airbag deployments. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a trauma center. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions in the two eastbound lanes of a four-lane freeway divided by a grassy sloped median. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Prius four door hatchback was eastbound in lane one of the two lanes negotiating a curve to the left. V1 first departed the roadway to the right with the right tires off the edge of the roadway. The driver of V1 made an attempt to steer back to the left onto the roadway and then began to rotate counterclockwise across both eastbound lanes. V1 then departed the roadway almost sliding laterally down into the grassy median. V1 then began to roll to the right six quarter-turns and came to final rest on its roof on the grassy median near the shoulder edge of the westbound lanes facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver, a 75 year old male, is the case occupant and was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. He was transported with serious injuries to a trauma center. Another passenger, a 72 year-old female, was seated in the front right position and was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. She was treated at a local hospital with moderate injuries.
