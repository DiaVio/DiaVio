Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 22-year-old, male driver, of a 2009 Nissan Maxima 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a shallow near side impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the post mid-night hours (dark, street lights present), of a summer weekday, on a curved, two-lane residential roadway. This north/south roadway has a right-turning curve with a slightly positive uphill grade for the northbound travel direction, leading into the crash area. The speed limit for the roadway is 25 mph (40 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2009 Nissan Maxima 4-door sedan, was being operated in the northbound travel lane by the 22-year-old male driver. Occupying the right front seating position was a 21-year-old male passenger. Both the driver and passenger were restrained by their respective 3-point lap/shoulder belts. Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, side impact hip/torso air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the right turning curve and continue traveling north. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 was unable to negotiate the right turning curve and departed the roadway on the left. Vehicle 1 ran somewhat parallel to the roadway before striking a tree with its left side plane, while in slight left side leading yaw (steering right). Vehicle 1 disengaged from the tree (counterclockwise rotation) and subsequently struck some minor shrubs/tree branches (minor impact) with its front left corner (headlight area) before impacting a street lamp post with its right side plane (suspected right rear wheel engagement - minor). Vehicle 1 came to rest at the northwest corner of an intersection at or near the impact area with the street lamp post. As a result of the tree impact, Vehicle 1's left roof side rail curtain and driver's side hip/torso air bags deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by air unit, to a local trauma center, but was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. The right front passenger of Vehicle 1 was reported to be uninjured and did not seek treatment. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
