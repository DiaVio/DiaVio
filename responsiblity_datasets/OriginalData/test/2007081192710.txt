Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Toyota Corolla four door sedan driven by a forty six (46) year old female, was stopped westbound in the number two lane waiting for traffic to clear to turn into a driveway on the south side of the roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Kia Sedona mini-van driven by a twenty nine (29) year old female, was traveling westbound in the number two lane approaching V1's location.
