The case vehicle a 2005 Dodge Magnum station wagon was west bound on a seven-lane divided traffic-way approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 2002 Chevrolet S-10 pick-up was southbound on the intersecting eight-lane divided traffic-way. The case vehicle crossed the path of V2 and the front of V2 struck the right fender of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise resulting in a side-slap impact. The case vehicle came to rest at the southwest corner facing southwest. V2 drove over the mountable raised island and came to rest west of the intersection, in the outside eastbound lane facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The sole occupant of the case vehicle, the 48-year-old male driver, was not restrained by a three-point belt, but steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with critical injuries.
