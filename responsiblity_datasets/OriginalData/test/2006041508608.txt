The crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The north/south roadway was a two-way, two-lane, undivided street without any traffic controls. The east/west roadway was a two-way, two-lane, undivided street controlled by a stop sign. The posted speed in all directions was 48 kmph (30 mph). Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 2006 Toyota Corolla with one occupant, was traveling westbound in lane one (contrary to police-reported travel direction). V2, a 1990 Chevrolet Astro Van with two occupants, was traveling northbound in lane one. Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection. As the vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V2 made contact with the right side of V1. As V1 rotated counterclockwise the front left of V1 hit the left side of V2. V1 continued across the intersection till the back of V1 made contact with a fence post as the vehicle went off the road. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.

V1, the Toyota Corolla, was driven by a 34-year old female, who was transported due to injury. She could not be reached for interview. However, she and two witnesses stated to police that she was traveling southbound, in the opposite direction of V2, when V2 drifted into her travel lane striking her vehicle. The physical evidence, damage patterns, and post-crash trajectories of the two vehicles did not support this claim. Instead, it is believed that the driver was traveling westbound as she entered the intersection.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection". The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an “type of driver error unknown”. Due to lack of interview information, no associated factors could be determined for this driver.

V2, the Chevy Astro Van, was driven by a 49-year old male, who was not transported to the hospital. He stated that he and his coworker were on their way home from work. They were casually talking. The driver recognized the other vehicle coming from east to west, when he was three or four meters from the intersection. According to the driver, the other car suddenly accelerated into the intersection, leaving the driver with no time to respond. The driver said witnesses showed up right after the crash, giving a conflicting story to the police.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was "other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, across path". The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. One associated factor for this driver was the presence of a social conversation with his passenger.
