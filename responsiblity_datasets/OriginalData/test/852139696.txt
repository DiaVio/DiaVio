This severe frontal crash into a tree occurred at night with street lights and clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Acura was travelling in northbound lanes of a five lane, two way street that curved to the left before an intersection. V1 drifted off the roadway and continued straight instead of following the curve to the left and traveled on a paved shoulder and onto a side walk with a raised curb edge. V1 impacted the raised curb and the front right and right rear tires were damaged and deflated. As V1 continued forward the left side tires also contacted the raised curb and were both damaged and deflated. As V1 continued on a grassy area it return to the sidewalk with the undercarriage of V1 scraping the raised curb, and then the left side of V1 swiped a traffic signal pole on the side walk that was damaged and replaced by the time of scene inspection. V1 then return to the roadway continuing to the north, crossing all the lanes of the east/west intersecting street and then departed the roadway down a slope into the woods. The front of V1 impacted a large tree and a overhanging branch struck the hood, windshield and roof. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and the left side driver's door had a minor impact with a second tree. V1 was damaged and towed. The driver is the case occupant, a 35 year old female who was not restrained by the belts, and had a frontal steering column mounted air bag deployment on impact with the large tree. The driver sustained severe injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center.
