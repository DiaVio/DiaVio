The case vehicle, a 2001 Pontiac Prix coupe, was traveling westbound on a wet two-lane asphalt roadway, approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and raining. The case vehicle was exiting a left-sweeping curve when it encountered standing water on the roadway. The driver lost control of the case vehicle as it hydroplaned due to the worn tread on the rear tires. The vehicle yawed counterclockwise and passed through the intersection. It departed the roadway, back-end leading, off of the south shoulder, just beyond the southwest corner of the intersection. The case vehicle went down the embankment of a ditch, and struck a utility pole with its left side and came to a rest. The impact sheared the wooden utility pole.

The case occupant is the restrained 49-year-old female driver. Her steering-wheel airbag did not deploy. She was the sole occupant of the vehicle. She was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center.
