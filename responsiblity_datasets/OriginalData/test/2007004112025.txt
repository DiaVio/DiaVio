V1 was driven by a 23-year-old male who reported "B" injuries and was transported to the hospital from the scene. The driver refused an interview, claiming that he did not remember what happened in the accident. According to the PAR, V1 was continuing straight down the roadway heading east. For some reason, the vehicle ran up the curb and struck the utility pole and fence. The only explanation the driver gave to the police was that he suffered a head injury about 5 months ago in a motorcycle accident. This head injury causes him to pass out and lose consciousness. When attempting to get an interview from the driver, the family stated that they did not know any specific information about the accident and that they were confused because the driver has been in a few other accidents recently.
