The crash occurred in the center of a four-way uncontrolled intersection composed of an undivided two-lane north/southbound roadway and an undivided two-lane east/westbound roadway. The north/south roadway was bituminous, straight and level with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). The eastbound roadway was bituminous, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (40 mph). The westbound roadway was bituminous, straight, and with an uphill grade (at 150 meters - 7.8 percent, at 100 meters - 6.25 percent, and at 50 meters - 4.6 percent) with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (40 mph). The crash occurred in the late morning on a weekday. The roads were dry and the skies were clear. The traffic flow was light to moderate.

V1, a 1991 Chrysler New Yorker 4-door sedan, was traveling east in lane one intending on making a left at the intersection. V2, a 1998 Dodge Caravan minivan, was traveling west in lane one intending on continuing straight through the intersection. As V1 approached the intersection, the car slowed down to make a left. V2 was traveling uphill towards the intersection. As V2 was entering the intersection, V1 turned left in front of V2. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and braking but was unsuccessful. The front of V1 struck the left front of V2. V2 came to final rest approximately 13 meters northwest of point of impact partially off the roadway. V1 came to final rest in the westbound lane facing northwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1, the Chrysler New Yorker, was driven by a 17-year-old male who reported "C" injuries and was transported to a medical facility. Two other passengers were also in the vehicle, a 16-year-old female who reported "C" injuries, but was not transported and a 12-year-old female who reported "C" injuries and was transported to a medical facility. V1 was traveling east on the roadway and slowed down to make a left. The driver of V2 reported that she saw the driver and his passenger laughing as he proceeded to make the left turn in front of her vehicle. She noticed the driver looked surprised when he finally saw her vehicle but it was too late to try and avoid the collision with her. The driver of V2 also stated that the driver of V1 claimed to have never saw her coming up the hill and that is why he proceeded to make the left, because he thought the intersection was clear when it was not. The front of V1 struck the left front of V2. The driver of V1 could not be reached for an interview.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling-turning left at intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as a driver related factor, "Internal distraction." According to the driver of V2, the driver of V1 was engaged in conversation or joking around with the other passengers in the car and was not paying attention to the roadway. One associated factor coded to this driver was inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see. According to what the driver of V2 stated, the driver of V1 claimed that he did not see her because she was coming up the hill and he thought the intersection was clear. It was not until he was into the turn that he saw V2 and realized that the intersection was not clear, but it was too late to avoid the collision. The other associated factor that could be coded to the driver was inexperience. Without an interview, no other factors could be coded.

V2, the Dodge Caravan, was driven by a 36-year-old female who reported "C" injuries and was transported to a medical facility. Her passenger, a 39-year-old male, was also transported to a medical facility with "C" injuries. The driver stated that she was on her way home from the store. She was coming towards the intersection (coming uphill) when she saw V1 approaching the intersection. She said that she was going to slow down, but saw that V1 appeared to be slowing down instead so she figured that the driver saw her, and she accelerated as she approached the intersection. As she entered the intersection, V1 began to turn left in front of her vehicle. She tried to avoid the collision by steering right and braking, but was unsuccessful. Her left front was struck by the front of V1. Her vehicle came to final rest approximately 13 meters northwest of point of impact partially off the roadway.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as, "Other vehicle encroachment- from opposite direction, over left lane line." No Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded for V2. The only other associated factor coded to the driver was a false assumption-assumed that other driver would yield the right-of-way. The driver stated that she only accelerated because she thought that the driver of V1 was slowing down because he saw her and was going to let her go before he proceeded to turn. However, that assumption was incorrect.
