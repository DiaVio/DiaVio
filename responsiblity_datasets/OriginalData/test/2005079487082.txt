This three-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday. The crash occurred at the intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway. The intersection is controlled by a tri-light traffic signal with no protected left phase. The speed limits are 56 kmph (35 mph) for east-west traffic and 40 kmph (25 mph) for north-south traffic. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Ford E-250 van, was traveling eastbound in the fourth lane of a seven-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway. V1 was stopped in the intersection and awaiting an opportunity to turn left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Toyota Camry, was traveling eastbound in the second lane of opposing traffic, approaching the same intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle three (V3), a 1992 Dodge Caravan, was stopped at the entrance to the intersection facing south in the first lane of a two-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, and awaiting an opportunity to turn right. As V1 made its turn, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. Both vehicles rotated clockwise and moved northwest. V2 came to rest in the intersection. V1 entered the first southbound lane, where the left side of V1 contacted the front of V3, bringing V1 to rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The 49-year-old male driver of V1 reported that he was stopped in the intersection, and he proceeded into the intersection when the tri-light entered the red phase. Local traffic regulation gives V1 the right-of-way in this instance. The driver said that he saw the approach of V2, but he assumed that V2 would stop as the other westbound traffic stopped. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded as a driver related factor: false assumption of other's actions.

The 82-year-old female driver of V2 did not provide an interview. She told police that she entered the intersection on the yellow phase of the tri-light, but nothing corroborates her statement. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical event was not attributed to V2. An associative factor of illegal maneuver is attributed to V2 for failing to observe the traffic control device.

The 48-year-old female driver of V3 was stopped and awaiting an opportunity to turn right into westbound traffic. She did not provide an interview, but reported to police that her light was still in the red phase when V1 executed his turn. She did not observe the light for eastbound traffic. V3 was not involved in the first harmful event, and the critical reason is not attributed to V3.
