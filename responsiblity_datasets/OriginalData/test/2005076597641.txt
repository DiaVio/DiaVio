This single vehicle crash occurred on a three-lane asphalt constructed roadway. This roadway runs east to west with two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. This roadway has a downgrade of -6 percent going west with a right hand curve and a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The super elevation was 6.5 % in the curve. The advisory speed limit at this location is 89 kmph (55 mph). Both sides of this roadway have protective guardrail. This crash occurred at dusk with a heavy rain falling and the roadway had moving run-off water from the left side to the right side.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer 4 door sedan, was traveling west going down the grade and negotiating a sweeping right hand curve. It was raining hard and the driver had slowed to a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). As V1 was negotiating the curve it began to hydroplane and slid left across the eastbound travel lanes. V1 exited the road edge and struck the guardrail on the left side of the road with its left front bumper corner. V1 then rotated clockwise and side slapped the guardrail with its left rear quarter panel. The vehicle slid down the wet roadway before the driver came to a controlled stop off the left side road in a pullout area. V1 sustained disabling damage to the left front wheel and axle and was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

The driver reported that she was well rested, not ill and not taking any medications. Immediately prior to the onset of the crash she and the passenger were conversing socially. This was her first time driving on this roadway. She was a relatively inexperienced driver (with just a year's worth of driving experience), but felt comfortable driving this vehicle. The 17 year-old female driver and 18 year-old male passenger were in use of the installed lap and shoulder belts and were not injured.

The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event is coded as a driver related factor: traveling too fast for conditions (specified as: the heavy rain/wet roadway). The vehicle hydroplaned as it negotiated the right hand curve during a period of heavy rain.
