Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was a 1995/BMW/740 IL, four-door sedan vehicle. The only occupant was the 35 y.o. male driver (case occupant). The vehicle is equipped with a frontal steering wheel mounted air bag along with a manual lap and shoulder belt. The frontal air bag (steering wheel mounted) deployed and it appears the manual lap and shoulder belt were not in use. This vehicle was equipped with a passenger side (frontal, mid instrument panel mounted) air bag, which did not deploy. This crash occurred in the morning, on a dry, level, concrete roadway with no adverse weather conditions. This crash occurred on a ten-lane trafficway (five westbound lanes and five eastbound lanes) with shoulders on each road edge. There is a concrete barrier separating the west and east roadways and a metal guardrail located on the outer edge of the shoulders. The involved roadway had a speed limit of 80kmph (50mph). Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was initially traveling westbound in the left travel lane (second lane), when for some unknown reason the driver lost control a traveled off the north road-edge. V1 impacted the metal guardrail with it's front bumper. V1 continued on, rotating clockwise impacting the left front and then the left rear with the guardrail. As V1 continued rotating clockwise, it impacted its right rear before traveling to it's final resting position back onto the roadway facing northeast. At final rest the driver's side door panel caught on fire (minor fire). The driver (case occupant) of V1 exited the vehicle by himself. He was then transported from the scene to a local trauma center where he was admitted for 7 days for injuries received in the crash.
