The case vehicle, a 2001 Mitsubishi Galant sedan, was eastbound on snow covered two-lane roadway. Vehicle two, a 2003 Ford Explorer 4x4 SUV (V2), was westbound on the same roadway. V2 drove off of the north edge of the road and the driver attempted to return to the roadway. The driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle and V2 crossed the center line, entered the path of the case vehicle and struck it in a front-to-front impact configuration. The driver of the case vehicle, aware of the impending impact, attempted to avoid it by braking and veering right, as evidenced by gouge mark near the eastbound lane fog line. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate approximately 30 degrees clockwise and depart the roadway. It struck a 'No Passing' sign before it came to rest straddling the south shoulder and the roadside facing southeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 140 degrees before it came to rest on the roadway, facing east-southeast, straddling both travel lanes.

The case occupant, the 49-year-old restrained male driver and the 51-year-old restrained female right-front passenger were the only occupants. Both the driver and the passenger frontal-impact airbags deployed. The driver side-impact airbag also deployed. The right-front passenger was taken to an outside hospital where she died approximately one-and-a-half hours post-crash. The case occupant was transported a level-one trauma center directly from the scene.
