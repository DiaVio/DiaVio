Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. For unknown reasons, V1 departed the roadway to the right side where it traveled down an embankment, striking a small tree with its front right, a wooden fence post with its front right, continuing and hitting a large tree with its front and then coming to final rest. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 50-year-old male, was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and had the frontal airbag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported by helicopter to a level-one trauma center.
