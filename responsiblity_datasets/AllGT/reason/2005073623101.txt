The reason for this is that V1 left its lane, crossed the centerline, and impacted V2's left side near the rear axle with its front. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining its lane and encroached into the opposite lane, causing the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 left yaw marks in the eastbound lane, further supporting the fact that V1 was not in its designated lane. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had dizziness, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain their lane and encroaching into the opposite lane, resulting in the collision with V2.
