The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to avoid colliding with Vehicle 2, which was stopped in the travel lane. Instead of safely maneuvering around Vehicle 2, the driver of Vehicle 1 steered to the left but still ended up striking the back left corner of Vehicle 2. This initial collision caused Vehicle 2 to be pushed forward and out of the way, while Vehicle 1 continued towards the left roadside, ultimately colliding with a tree. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident due to their failure to avoid the collision with Vehicle 2 and subsequent loss of control.
