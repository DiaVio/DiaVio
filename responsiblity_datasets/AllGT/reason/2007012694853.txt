The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and crossed through the intersection without yielding the right of way to Vehicle #2 (V2). This is evident from the statement of the driver of V1, who admitted to not being attentive to the stop signs and not realizing there was a crossing street with a stop sign. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not remember coming to the intersection or where the other vehicle came from, indicating a lack of awareness and attention. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (V2) was traveling on the north/south roadway and had the right of way since there was no control for that roadway. The driver of V2 reported seeing the other vehicle at the last second and thought it would stop, indicating that she had the expectation that V1 would yield at the stop sign. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2 makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
