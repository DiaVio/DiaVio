The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was making a right turn at the intersection and failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle. The driver crossed the centerline and impacted Vehicle two (the 2000 Chevrolet Impala) on its left side. Additionally, Vehicle one continued after the initial impact and collided with a fire hydrant. Although the driver of Vehicle one mentioned experiencing sun glare, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure safe and proper control of the vehicle, especially when making a turn at an intersection. The driver's statement that they hit the gas pedal instead of the brakes further indicates a lack of proper control. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and braking but was unable to do so. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle one.
