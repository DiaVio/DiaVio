The driver of V1 made a U-turn into the southbound lanes without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This driver error of inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2 (the Lincoln LS). V2's driver stated that she did not expect V1 to turn in front of her, indicating that V1's U-turn was unexpected and likely contributed to the accident.
