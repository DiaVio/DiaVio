The reason for V1's responsibility is that it experienced tire-related problems, specifically a blown-out left front tire. This caused V1 to veer to the left and collide with a wall and rail attached to the top of the wall. The physical evidence at the scene, including debris and a post-impact skid mark, clearly indicates that V1's left front corner hit the wall. Therefore, V1's loss of control due to the tire failure and subsequent collision with the wall make it primarily responsible for the crash.
