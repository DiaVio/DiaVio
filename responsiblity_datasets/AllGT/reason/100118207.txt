The reason for this is that V2 accelerated and steered right in an attempt to change lanes to the right, while both vehicles were traveling side by side at nearly the same relative speed. This maneuver caused V2 to strike V1 on its left side, and then continued to veer right, forcing V1 to the right where it struck the concrete wall. V2 remained in contact with V1 and continued to apply force, ultimately pushing V1 over the bridge wall and causing it to overturn and fall onto the roadway below. Therefore, V2's actions of changing lanes abruptly and causing the collision with V1, as well as the subsequent force applied that led to V1's overturning and fall, make V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
