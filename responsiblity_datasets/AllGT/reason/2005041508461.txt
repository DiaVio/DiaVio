The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an unsafe lane change by attempting to pass V2 (the Freightliner truck-tractor) on the right and enter the fifth lane of travel, which was also a left turn lane. This maneuver was not only illegal but also resulted in a collision with the back of V2. Despite the driver's attempt to avoid a non-contact vehicle entering the same lane, the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and rear-ended V2. Therefore, V1's unsafe lane change and failure to maintain control of their vehicle make them primarily responsible for the crash.
