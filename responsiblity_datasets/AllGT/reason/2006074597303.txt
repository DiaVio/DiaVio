The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to being distracted by reaching down to grab a cup of coffee just before the collision. This internal distraction caused the driver to not notice the approaching Vehicle 2 (1993 Chevrolet Cavalier) and resulted in Vehicle 1 being struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle 2. Although Vehicle 2 entered the intersection when the light turned yellow, the driver of Vehicle 2 was not licensed, which is a separate violation. However, the primary cause of the collision was the distraction of the driver of Vehicle 1.
