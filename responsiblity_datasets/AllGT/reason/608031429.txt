The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it failed to negotiate the left-sweeping curve, causing it to depart the roadway and collide with a wooden light-pole. This indicates a lack of control and failure to maintain the proper trajectory on the road. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a failure to take necessary safety precautions, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of the injuries sustained.
