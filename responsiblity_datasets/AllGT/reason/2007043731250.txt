The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop for her red signal at the intersection, indicating a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, V1 admitted to not paying attention to the traffic signal because she was distracted by a phone call and preoccupied with thoughts about her schedule for the next day. This inattention and failure to obey traffic signals led to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1994 Ford Ranger). V2, on the other hand, had a green signal and entered the intersection without seeing V1 until the last second. V2 did not have time to avoid the crash, indicating that V2 was following traffic laws and had the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to stop for the red signal and her inattention while driving.
