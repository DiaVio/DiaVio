The driver of V1 failed to control the vehicle while attempting to retrieve the ignition keys that had fallen onto the floor. This resulted in V1 making a left turn across the eastbound traffic lanes, directly into the path of V2 (the 1976 Chevrolet Nova four door sedan). V2 attempted to avoid the collision by hard braking, but was unable to do so, resulting in the impact between the two vehicles.
