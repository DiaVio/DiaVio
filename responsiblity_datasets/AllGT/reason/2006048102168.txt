The driver of Vehicle one misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle two, which was traveling in the southbound lanes. Vehicle one entered the intersection, intending to turn left, without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This misjudgment led to the collision between the front of Vehicle two and the left side of Vehicle one. Although Vehicle two was traveling slightly above the speed limit, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle one as they failed to yield the right of way and made an unsafe left turn. Vehicle three, which was behind Vehicle two, also applied the brakes and attempted to slow down, but was unable to avoid colliding with the right side of Vehicle one after it rotated counterclockwise. In summary, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of oncoming traffic.
