The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1, on the other hand, was proceeding straight through the intersection with a steady green traffic light. V2 turned left in front of V1, failing to yield the right of way, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 was given a citation for careless driving by the police officer, further indicating their responsibility in the accident.
