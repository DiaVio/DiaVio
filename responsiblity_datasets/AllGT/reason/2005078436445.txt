The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn onto the through street, into the path of V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord), without properly ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver of V1 had an obstructed view due to the non-contact vehicle turning right onto the street that V1 was stopped on, but it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed with the left turn. The driver of V1 looked but did not see V2 prior to the impact, indicating a failure to exercise proper caution and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
