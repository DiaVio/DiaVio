The driver of Vehicle # 2 was attempting to make a left turn from the service lane and failed to adequately surveil the intersection. The driver was distracted by a phone call with her sister, which contributed to her failure to see Vehicle # 1 approaching in the right lane of the main roadway. Additionally, the driver had limited experience driving on this roadway and was wearing prescription sunglasses that corrected a near-sighted condition. These factors combined led to the driver's failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle # 1, resulting in the collision.
