The driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, which indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver overcompensated when trying to regain control, which further contributed to the crash. The fact that the vehicle slid off the asphalt onto the gravel shoulder suggests that the driver was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the curve. Furthermore, the driver's lack of seat belts in the vehicle is another contributing factor to the severity of the crash and the driver's fatality. The presence of a borderline diabetic condition may have also affected the driver's ability to react and control the vehicle effectively. Overall, the driver's failure to maintain control, overcompensation, potential speeding, lack of seat belts, and possible health condition all point to V1 as primarily responsible for the crash.
