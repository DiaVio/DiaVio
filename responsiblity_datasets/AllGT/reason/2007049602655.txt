The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while trying to avoid an object in the roadway. This caused the vehicle to enter the median and subsequently collide with a light pole. The driver's overcompensation and loss of control ultimately led to the vehicle crossing into the westbound lanes and coming to rest facing west.
