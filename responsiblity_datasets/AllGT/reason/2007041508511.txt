The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver admitted to being only fifteen meters (fifty feet) behind V2 (the 2006 Hyundai Sonata) when another car cut off V2, causing V2 to slow suddenly. Despite being attentive to the actions of the lead vehicle, V1 was following so closely that the driver could not avoid a collision when V2 braked suddenly. This indicates a driver-related decision error on the part of V1, as they failed to maintain a safe following distance.
