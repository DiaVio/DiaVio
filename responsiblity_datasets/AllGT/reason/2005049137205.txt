The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn from the second lane of the eastbound direction, which is an illegal maneuver. V1 failed to maintain financial responsibility and did not have a driver's license, which further indicates a lack of responsibility and compliance with traffic laws. Additionally, V1 stated that their view of V2 was blocked by the retaining wall, suggesting a failure to properly assess the traffic situation before making the turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Escort sedan) applied brakes and steered the vehicle to the left when V1 crossed their path, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. V2 claimed that their view of V1 was blocked by the retaining wall, which suggests that they may not have had sufficient time to react to V1's illegal maneuver. Therefore, V1's illegal left turn and failure to maintain financial responsibility and have a driver's license make them primarily responsible for the accident.
