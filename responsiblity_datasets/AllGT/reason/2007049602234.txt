The driver admitted to not seeing the stop sign and failing to stop at the intersection. This failure to obey the stop sign is a clear violation of traffic laws and indicates negligence on the part of the driver. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the brush pile on the northwest corner may have contributed to the driver's failure to see the stop sign, but it does not absolve them of responsibility for the accident.
