The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the gap between his vehicle and V2 (the 2002 Jeep Liberty) while changing lanes. This misjudgment led to V1's front striking the back of V2. Therefore, V1's driver-related factor of external distraction and misjudgment of the gap behind V2 were associated factors in causing the crash.
