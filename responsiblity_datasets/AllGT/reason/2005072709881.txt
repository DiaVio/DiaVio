V1 veered left and crossed all southbound lanes, ultimately colliding with Vehicle 2 (V2) and Vehicle 3 (V3). The critical reason for V1's actions was "inadequate surveillance," as the driver stated they were trying to move to the express lane but failed to properly observe their surroundings. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to adequately surveil the traffic and safely change lanes.
