The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and not adequately surveilling the intersection before entering it. He was thinking about the exam he had just taken and what he needed to buy at the store. This indicates that he was not fully focused on the road and failed to notice the presence of V2 (the 1995 Chevrolet sport Van) approaching the intersection. Additionally, Witness #1 stated that V1 attempted to steer to the left to avoid the crash, suggesting that V1 had the opportunity to see V2 and take evasive action but failed to do so. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and inattention are the reasons for the crash.
