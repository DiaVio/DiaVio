The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to stop in time to avoid colliding with V2, which was stopped at a red light. - The driver of V1 reported that he did not know the status of the traffic control or if it was working, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. - The driver of V1 also admitted to having deficient brakes and being under the influence of alcohol, which impaired his ability to respond to the unexpected actions of others. - Additionally, the driver of V1 suffered from various physical ailments and was fatigued due to sleep apnea, further compromising his ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
