The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to change lanes without properly checking for obstacles or taking evasive action. The driver admitted to being unsure of whether to take the exit ramp or go straight, and at the last moment, decided to take the exit ramp without seeing the barrier. This lack of attention and poor directional control led to V1's right side impacting the barrier, causing the subsequent collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the other 1999 Ford F-150 pick-up) cannot be held primarily responsible as they were traveling in their designated lane and attempted to brake and steer to the left to avoid the collision. V2's actions indicate an attempt to prevent the accident, while V1's actions demonstrate a failure to exercise caution and make a safe lane change. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly check for obstacles, lack of evasive action, and poor directional control.
