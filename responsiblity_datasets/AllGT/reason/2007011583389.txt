The driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including speeding, cutting in and out of traffic, and traveling too fast for the conditions of the road. These actions led to the loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately caused the crash. Additionally, the driver's concerns about being late for work and the potential consequences of being fired likely contributed to her reckless driving behavior. Furthermore, the fact that her driver's license was under suspension at the time of the crash indicates a disregard for traffic laws and safety.
