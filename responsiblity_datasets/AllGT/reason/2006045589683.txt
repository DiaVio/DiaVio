The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 while attempting to make a left turn. V1 stated that a car in the right westbound lane let him out and he edged into traffic. However, he did not adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and failed to see V2 approaching. This failure to yield and inadequate surveillance led to the collision between V1 and V2.
