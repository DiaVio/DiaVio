The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed (105 kph or 65 mph) than the posted speed limit (89 kph or 55 mph) on a downhill grade with a curved road. V1 crossed the center line into the northbound lane, resulting in a sideswipe with Vehicle 2 (V2) and an offset frontal collision with Vehicle 3 (V3). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within its lane, causing the accident.
