The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, as indicated by her medical records. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as an unknown driver error, specifically traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle one was not in proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with the parked Vehicle two (the Ford F-150).
