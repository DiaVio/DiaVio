Reason: V1 was the moving vehicle that made a right turn onto the major roadway. The driver of V1 was distracted while attempting to light a cigarette, causing him to not notice the parked Vehicle Two (V2) until the last minute. Additionally, the driver of V1 was an unlicensed driver, operating the vehicle without a valid driver's license. These factors indicate that V1 was not exercising proper caution and control while driving, leading to the collision with V2.
