The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass V2 on the left side, which is a violation of traffic rules. V1 made contact with the left side of V2's vehicle, causing it to rotate and come to a stop. Additionally, V1 fled the scene of the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
