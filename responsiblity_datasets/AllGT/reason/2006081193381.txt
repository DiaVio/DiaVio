The driver of V1 made a sudden lane change to take the exit, crossing multiple lanes and departing the roadway. This decision to change lanes abruptly and sharply to the right, without proper control and at a speed too fast for the curve, led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway and the distraction caused by her mother yelling at her to take the exit also contributed to the driver's poor decision-making and inability to maintain control. Additionally, the mismatch in tire pressure, with one tire significantly deflated, was a factor that affected the vehicle's handling. Overall, the driver's decision to change lanes suddenly, combined with poor control, excessive speed for the curve, distraction, and the mismatch in tire pressure, led to the crash.
