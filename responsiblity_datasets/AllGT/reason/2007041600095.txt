The reason for this is that V1, described as a white sedan, was traveling in lane four and decided to change lanes into lane five, where V2 was already traveling. V1 hit the right front of V2, causing V2 to lose control and begin rotating. V1 then fled the scene without stopping. Therefore, V1's decision to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so, and their subsequent failure to stop after the collision, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
