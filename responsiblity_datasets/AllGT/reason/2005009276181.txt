The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included rain and a wet roadway. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event, which states that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the curve/turn. Additionally, the driver's own statement that the car started to slide and she lost control suggests that she was not able to maintain control of the vehicle within the given conditions. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 did not have a driver's license and was not supposed to be driving. This further supports the argument that she was not taking the necessary precautions and responsibilities while operating the vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed for the conditions and lack of proper licensing.
