The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking over his right shoulder to check if the third lane was available for a lane change. This distraction caused him to not notice that V2 had stopped ahead of him, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver's statement that he did not have time to attempt any avoidance maneuvers further supports his responsibility for the accident.
