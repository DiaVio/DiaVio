The reason for this is that V1 rear-ended V2 (unknown hit and run vehicle) while V2 was stopped in traffic. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the stationary vehicle in front. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 fled the scene and drug paraphernalia was found in the car suggests possible impairment or illegal activity, further indicating negligence on the part of the driver of V1.
