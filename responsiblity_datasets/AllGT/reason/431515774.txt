The reason for this is that V2 was traveling behind Vehicle #3 (V3) and was unable to stop or slow down due to the icy roadway. As a result, V2 steered into the northbound travel lane and entered the intersection, ultimately colliding with Vehicle #1 (V1), the 2005 Toyota 4-Runner. V2's inability to control its vehicle and steer back into the southbound lane contributed to the collision.
