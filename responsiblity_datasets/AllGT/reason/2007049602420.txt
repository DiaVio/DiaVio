Reason: V2 abruptly entered V1's lane, causing V1 to take evasive action to avoid a collision. This sudden maneuver by V2 forced V1 to steer to the right, resulting in V1 running off the road and subsequently colliding with the guardrail. V2's actions created a dangerous situation for V1, leading to the accident.
