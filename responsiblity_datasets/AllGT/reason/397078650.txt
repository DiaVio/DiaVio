The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, causing it to rotate in a clockwise direction and slide laterally. V1 then struck and mounted the north curb, departed the roadway, and collided with a pay phone. The impact with the pay phone uprooted its stand, and V1 continued sliding, striking a concrete porch and a steel non-breakaway pole. The driver's head was ejected out the left front window and struck the pole, resulting in loss of consciousness. Therefore, V1's loss of control and subsequent collisions indicate that it was the primary cause of the crash.
