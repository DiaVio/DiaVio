The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 applied the brakes and steered right in response to a non-contact vehicle swerving into his lane. This overcompensation by the driver of V1 caused the vehicle to travel off the right side of the road, resulting in the subsequent collision with the embankment and the rollover. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation in response to the encroachment of the non-contact vehicle.
