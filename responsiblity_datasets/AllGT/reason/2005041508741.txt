The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was operating the vehicle without a driver's license and without any form of driver education. Additionally, it was the driver's first time on the roadway and the first time driving any type of vehicle. The driver admitted to not knowing how to drive and losing control of the vehicle when it slipped into gear. This indicates a lack of skill and experience in controlling the vehicle, leading to the crash.
