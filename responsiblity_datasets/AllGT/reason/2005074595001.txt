The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy conditions on the downhill roadway approaching the intersection. Additionally, the driver attempted to accelerate and swing the vehicle around the corner to the right to avoid a collision, but was unable to do so successfully. The driver's assumption that other drivers would see him in trouble and slow down or stop was also a contributing factor. Overall, V1's actions, including driving too fast for the conditions, attempting a risky maneuver, and relying on the assumption of other drivers' actions, indicate a lack of caution and responsibility, making them primarily responsible for the collision.
