The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left-hand turn across the southbound lanes of the north/south trafficway. V2, the 2005 Mercury Mountaineer, was traveling in the right-hand southbound travel lane and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the angular left side impact between the two vehicles.
