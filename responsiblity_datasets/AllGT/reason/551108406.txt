The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was the vehicle that departed the roadway, rotated counterclockwise, and ultimately collided with multiple trees. The driver of V1 was passing another vehicle prior to the curve, which indicates a potential unsafe maneuver. Additionally, none of the occupants in V1 were wearing seatbelts, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. It is important to note that without further information about the actions of other vehicles involved (if any), it is difficult to determine if there is shared responsibility or if any other factors contributed to the accident.
