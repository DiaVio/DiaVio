The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer right to straighten out resulted in a clockwise yaw, further indicating a lack of control. Ultimately, V1 ended up departing the roadway to the left and colliding with a tree. The fact that the driver was not wearing a seatbelt and no airbags deployed also suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which may have contributed to the severity of the accident.
