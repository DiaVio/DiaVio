The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not adequately survey the intersection before turning right. This is evident from the witness statement and the driver of V2, who both stated that V1 did not stop at the stop sign and did not look to the right before entering the intersection. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 was not in the correct lane position prior to the crash. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign, inadequate surveillance, and incorrect lane position make them primarily responsible for the accident.
