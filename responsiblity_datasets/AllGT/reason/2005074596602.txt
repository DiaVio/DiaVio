The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Chevrolet Pickup). While Vehicle 2 was encroaching into the left lane, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 as they were the one making the left turn and had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic.
