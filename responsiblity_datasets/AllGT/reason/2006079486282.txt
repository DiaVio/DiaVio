The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver admitted to panicking and failing to apply brakes or attempt any evasive maneuvers when they saw V2 (the Chrysler minivan) coming through the intersection. This indicates a lack of proper judgment and response in a critical situation, leading to the collision. Additionally, V1 was making a left turn, which requires extra caution and yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, on the other hand, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. Although V2 did not have her glasses on, there is no evidence to suggest that her vision impairment contributed to the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, indicating that V1's vehicle crossed into V2's lane. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to react appropriately and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
