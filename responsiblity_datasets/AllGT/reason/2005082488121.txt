The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they pulled out from a curbside parking space without ensuring it was safe to merge into the southbound lane. V1 made a false assumption that V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry Solara Coupe) would swerve to avoid them, without taking any avoidance actions themselves. This indicates a lack of attentiveness and failure to properly assess the situation before merging into traffic. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was thinking about upcoming mid-term exams and had only 5 hours of sleep the previous night. These factors may have contributed to their lack of focus and poor decision-making while driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to yield the right of way and their false assumption of other drivers' actions.
