The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn from the wrong lane, veering left into eastbound traffic. This illegal maneuver caused V2 (the driver of the 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier) to collide with the left side of V1. Witnesses and evidence support this account. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to a driver-related decision error and an illegal maneuver.
