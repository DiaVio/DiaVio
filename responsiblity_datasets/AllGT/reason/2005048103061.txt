The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the left lane line and made contact with the front of V2 (the 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass). The critical event for V1 was coded as poor directional control, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of their vehicle within their travel lane and crossed into the oncoming traffic lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 had recently undergone knee surgery and had been to physical therapy earlier in the day, which may have contributed to their poor control of the vehicle. On the other hand, the critical event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident.
