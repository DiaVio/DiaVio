The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before pulling through, even though there were potential sightline obstructions on the right side of the roadway. The driver of V1 made a false assumption that it was clear to pass through based on the wave from the northbound truck driver, without looking again to his right. This lack of proper surveillance and failure to ensure the intersection was clear led to the collision with V2 (the 1998 Ford Ranger) and subsequently with V3 (the 2001 Chevrolet Silverado).
