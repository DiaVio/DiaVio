The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for its red light and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by a phone conversation, which further contributed to the recognition error and failure to stop for the traffic control device. Therefore, V2's failure to obey the traffic signal and the driver's distraction are the main factors that led to the accident.
