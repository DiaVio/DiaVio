The driver of V1 was following too closely to V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Suburban) at a distance of 2-3 car lengths, which is insufficient for a safe stopping distance. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed lower than the posted speed limit, indicating that they were not maintaining a safe speed for the conditions. Furthermore, the driver of V1 had underinflated tires, which would have increased the vehicle's stopping distance. This, combined with the congested traffic and the sudden stop of the forward vehicle, contributed to the driver of V1 being unable to stop in time and colliding with the rear of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely, traveling at a speed lower than the posted limit, and having underinflated tires.
