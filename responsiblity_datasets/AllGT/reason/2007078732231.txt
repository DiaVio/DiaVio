The driver of V1 was distracted by looking at his cell phone, which caused him to veer off the road and nearly strike a parked vehicle. He then overcompensated and lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it rolling over in the median. The witness at the scene also confirmed that V1 was not paying attention and almost hit his vehicle.
