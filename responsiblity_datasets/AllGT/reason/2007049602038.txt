The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she turned with an obstructed view. This means that she attempted to make a left turn at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. Despite having a protective left turn arrow, V1 failed to properly assess the traffic situation before starting her turn. This resulted in her crossing the path of V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Equinox), causing the collision. On the other hand, V2 was driving within their lane and had the right of way as they were traveling straight through the intersection. V2 stated that they did not see V1 due to a vehicle traveling in the lane to their left, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to ensure a clear view of oncoming traffic before making the left turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
