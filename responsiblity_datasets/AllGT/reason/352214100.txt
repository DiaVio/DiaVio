The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the south side of the roadway and struck the drainage ditch/culvert area, causing it to roll over and come to rest on its roof. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to negotiate the left turning curve, resulting in the collision.
