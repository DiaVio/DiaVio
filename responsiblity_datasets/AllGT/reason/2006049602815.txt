The reason for this is that V1 traveled onto the median and struck a utility pole. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side." The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." Additionally, the witness at the scene stated that the driver of V1 seemed very tired, and there was mention of an argument with her boyfriend just prior to the crash. While the exact cause of the driver error is unknown, it is possible that fatigue or distraction played a role in V1 veering off the road and colliding with the utility pole. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
