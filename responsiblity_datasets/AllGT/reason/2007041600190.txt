The reason for this is that V2 panicked and abruptly slammed her brakes, coming to a full stop in the lane, after seeing the mattress fall off the truck in front of her. This sudden stop created a hazardous situation for the vehicles behind her, including V1 (the 1998 Peter built Tractor-trailer truck) and V3 (the 2004 Mack Dump Truck). V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2, while V3, attempting to avoid the collision, swerved into lane two and hit V4 (the 2006 Chevy HHR) on its left side. Therefore, V2's actions of abruptly stopping in the lane without warning contributed to the chain of events that led to the subsequent collisions.
