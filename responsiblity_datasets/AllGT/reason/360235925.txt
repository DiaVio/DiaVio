The reason for this is that V2 was stopped for the traffic signal in the westbound left-turn only lane, waiting to make a left turn onto the intersecting street. The driver of V2 began to make a left turn as Vehicle 1 (V1) was crossing through the intersection. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
