The reason for this is that V1 started into the intersection on a red traffic signal, as reported by witnesses. Despite the driver of V1 stating that she was sure the signal had turned green, the police believed that the signal was red for V1. This indicates that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and proceeded into it when it was not safe to do so. As a result, V1 was struck by V2 (the 1996 Ford Explorer) which had the right of way with a green traffic signal.
