The reason for this is that Vehicle One was traveling at a speed of 121 kmph (75 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph). Additionally, Vehicle One attempted to change lanes to the right, resulting in a loss of control and the vehicle rotating clockwise off the right side of the road. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle One was not able to maintain proper control of the vehicle, leading to the crash. Furthermore, it is mentioned that none of the occupants in Vehicle One were restrained, which is a contributing factor to the severity of the crash and the fatalities of the back seat passengers. Overall, the primary responsibility for the crash lies with the driver of Vehicle One due to traveling too fast for conditions and poor directional control.
