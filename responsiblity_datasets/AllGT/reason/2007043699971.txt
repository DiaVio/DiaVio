The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 stated that V1 (the 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager minivan) continued through the yellow light and then abruptly slammed on her brakes. V2, being loaded with 21.5 tons of gravel, was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. This indicates that V2 was following V1 too closely and made a false assumption about V1's actions. Additionally, V2's heavy load contributed to the inability to stop within normal stopping distances. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe following distance and make a false assumption about V1's actions led to the rear-end collision, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
