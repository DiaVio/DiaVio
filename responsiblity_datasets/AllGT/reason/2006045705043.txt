The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 attempted an illegal maneuver by crossing all five lanes of the highway instead of making a standard right turn. This illegal maneuver resulted in a collision with Vehicle #2, causing damage to both vehicles. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was unlicensed at the time of the crash and admitted to taking several types of pills without prescriptions. These factors indicate a lack of responsibility and awareness while operating a vehicle.
