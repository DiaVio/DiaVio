The reason for this is that V1 was eastbound in lane one and was making a right turn onto the freeway access ramp. However, V1 departed the roadway to the left and collided with the barrier end of the bridge overpass structure. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle while executing the right turn, resulting in the accident.
