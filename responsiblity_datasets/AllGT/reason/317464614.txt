The reason for this is that V1, which was stopped at the stop sign, departed from the stop sign and entered the crossover area of the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic. This action resulted in the collision with V2 (the 2000 Infiniti I30) which was approaching the intersection in the eastbound lane. V2's driver recognized the impending collision and applied her brakes, indicating that she was taking appropriate measures to avoid the accident. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to yield the right of way and causing the collision.
