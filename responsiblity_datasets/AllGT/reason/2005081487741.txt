The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right and struck a culvert, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. The critical reason for this event was identified as a driver-related factor, specifically a diabetic emergency. It is mentioned that the V1 driver was an insulin-dependent diabetic and had not been taking his insulin correctly. This suggests that the driver's medical condition and failure to properly manage it contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision. Additionally, alcohol consumption was noted, which could have further impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely.
