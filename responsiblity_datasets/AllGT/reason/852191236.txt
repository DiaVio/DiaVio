The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, resulting in V1 rotating clockwise and departing the roadway. V1 then traveled down an embankment, crossed a small creek, and impacted multiple trees. The severe crush and intrusion into the passenger compartment indicate a significant impact, suggesting that V1 was traveling at an unsafe speed or failed to maintain control in snowy weather conditions. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt further contributes to their responsibility for the accident.
