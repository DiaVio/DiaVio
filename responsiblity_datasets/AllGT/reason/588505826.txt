The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the left side of Vehicle 1, causing both vehicles to be redirected and subsequently collide again with Vehicle 2's right side hitting Vehicle 1's left side. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
