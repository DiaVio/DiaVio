The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a u-turn across three lanes of traffic, which is an illegal maneuver. V2 (the Chevy Cavalier) had the green light and was traveling in lane three at the posted speed limit. V2 did not see V1 pulling across his lane, and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Although V2's driver being legally deaf and wearing a hearing aid could be considered an associative factor, it is not a contributing factor to the accident. The driver stated that his hearing impairment did not affect his driving. Additionally, there were no sounds or warnings from other drivers that would have alerted V2 to the presence of V1. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the illegal u-turn maneuver, while V2 was following traffic laws and had the right of way.
