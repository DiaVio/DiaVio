The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection intending to turn left. The driver of V1 was found to be inattentive and not paying attention to the driving task, as she was thinking about her health concerns. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which contributed to her inability to stop in time. The wet roadways and rain were also associated factors that contributed to the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 Ford Ranger pick-up) stated that he saw V1 go through the stop sign and attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering to the left. Therefore, V2's actions were reactive and in response to V1's failure to stop. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her failure to stop at the stop sign, inattentiveness, and traveling too fast for the wet road conditions.
