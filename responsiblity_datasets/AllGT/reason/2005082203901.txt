The driver of V1 admitted that she did not adequately check for approaching traffic before making the left turn onto the main roadway. This indicates a failure to exercise proper surveillance and ensure that the road was clear. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that parked cars at the corner of the intersection made it difficult to see approaching traffic, but this does not absolve her of responsibility as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure a safe turn. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
