The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance or failed to react in time to the stopped vehicle in front of them. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," suggesting that V1 was aware of the presence of the stopped vehicle but still failed to avoid the collision. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown," further indicating that V1's actions or lack of action contributed to the crash.
