The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 rear-ended Vehicle #2 (the 1995 Nissan pickup truck) while it was slowing down due to traffic at the controlled intersection ahead. Vehicle #2 had already slowed to under 5mph when the collision occurred. This indicates that Vehicle #1 failed to maintain a safe distance and failed to react in time to the slowing traffic. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was a 16-year-old inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to the recognition error and inability to react appropriately to the traffic situation. It is important to note that the lack of cooperation from Vehicle #1's driver's father prevented further information on causal factors from being obtained. However, based on the available information, Vehicle #1's failure to maintain a safe distance and react in time to the slowing traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
