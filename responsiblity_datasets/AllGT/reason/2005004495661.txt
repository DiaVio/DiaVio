The driver of V1 made the decision to pass a right-turning vehicle on the right, which is a violation of traffic laws. This decision, combined with traveling too fast and incorrect evasive action, led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and ultimately causing the collision. Additionally, the fact that the driver was unfamiliar with the rental car may have contributed to the lack of control.
