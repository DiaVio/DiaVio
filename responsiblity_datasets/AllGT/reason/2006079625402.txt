The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. However, V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the driver of the 1996 Chevrolet C-1500) was turning left and proceeded to make the turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. This false assumption of V2's actions led to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
