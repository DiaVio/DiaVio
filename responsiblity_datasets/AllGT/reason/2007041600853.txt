The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to not paying attention to the traffic light or the intersection. She stated that she was focused on the car in front of her and did not know for sure if the light had turned from green to red. Additionally, she was distracted due to a family problem, as her uncle had just passed away and she was on her way home to get ready for the funeral. This inadequate surveillance and distraction led to V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2 (the 2003 Subaru Outlander) that had the right of way.
