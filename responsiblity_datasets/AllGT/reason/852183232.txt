The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the right and departed the roadway, impacting a mound of dirt and swiping shrubbery. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle, resulting in it leaving the road and entering the ditch. The subsequent counterclockwise rotation and rollover onto its roof, as well as the impact with the embankment, further suggest a lack of control and negligence on the part of the driver of V1.
