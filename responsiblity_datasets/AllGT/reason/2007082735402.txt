The reason for this is that V1 was making a left-hand turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before proceeding. The critical reason assigned to V1 is "inadequate surveillance," indicating that she either failed to look or looked but did not see the approaching vehicle (V2). This lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision.
