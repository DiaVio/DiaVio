The driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control, as evidenced by the vehicle departing the roadway to the right before entering the left-hand curve. The driver's claim of swerving to avoid a deer is unsupported by evidence, as there were no skid marks indicating an evasive maneuver. Additionally, the vehicle's EDR revealed that the driver accelerated two seconds before impact, indicating a lack of braking or attempts to slow down. Furthermore, the driver was charged with DUI after registering a BAC of 0.22, well above the legal limit. The driver's reported use of medication for stress and high blood pressure, along with being overweight and having astigmatism, may have contributed to impaired driving abilities. Associated factors such as alcohol intoxication, inattention, traveling too fast, being upset, and work stress were coded to this driver. Additionally, a roadway-related factor was identified, as the curve was posted at a speed limit that was too high for its sharpness. Overall, the driver's impaired state, lack of control, and failure to adhere to the appropriate speed limit make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
