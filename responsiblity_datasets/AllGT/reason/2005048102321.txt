The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a speed of approximately 64 kmph (40 mph), which was at least 24 kmph (15 mph) above the posted speed limit. Additionally, V2 was distracted by talking on her cell phone and in a hurry because she was late for work. These factors contributed to V2's failure to notice V1 (the 2001 Dodge Stratus) pulling out from the parking area and turning left onto the roadway. While V1 did have an associative factor of adjusting the radio, V2's excessive speed and distracted driving were more significant factors in causing the accident.
