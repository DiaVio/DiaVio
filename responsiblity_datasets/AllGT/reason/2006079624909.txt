The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and had a recognition error. He admitted to placing his coffee cup in the cup holder while entering the intersection, indicating a momentary distraction from the task of driving. Additionally, he was unsure of the traffic signal phase, which shows a lack of attention to the road and traffic conditions. These factors contributed to his failure to recognize the approaching V2 and take appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision. While V2 (the driver of the Jeep Grand Cherokee) had an expired driver's license and under-inflated tires, these factors alone do not establish primary responsibility for the collision. V2 reported that the traffic signal was in the green phase when entering the intersection and attempted to brake to avoid the collision, indicating a reasonable response to the situation. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's distraction and recognition error, which led to the failure to avoid the collision with V2.
