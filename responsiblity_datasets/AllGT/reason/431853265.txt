The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was initially eastbound and maneuvered into the left turn lane to proceed north (left) onto the residential connector. As Vehicle 2 crossed the westbound travel lanes, it impacted the left front side surface of Vehicle 1, resulting in moderate damage to both vehicles. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, causing the collision.
