The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 drifted over the lane line into the center lane and struck Vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle #1 was coded as falling asleep, indicating that drowsiness may have been a contributing factor to the driver's poor directional control and drifting into the adjacent lane. Additionally, Vehicle #1 veered away from Vehicle #2 after the initial impact, suggesting that the driver had some control over the vehicle's movements. Since Vehicle #2 is coded as a hit and run, there is no information available to determine its responsibility in the crash.
