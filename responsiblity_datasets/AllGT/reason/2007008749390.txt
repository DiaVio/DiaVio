The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling in lane one, negotiating a right curve, and failed to notice that V2 (the 2005 Subaru Outback) was stopped at the intersection. V1 then impacted the rear of V2. The driver of V1 stated that she was looking for a yoga studio and wasn't looking where she was going. This indicates a lack of attention and negligence on the part of the driver of V1. While V2's driver was distracted by an external factor, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 was already in the lane and traveling at a higher speed when V1 collided with it. However, V2's driver was not primarily responsible for the crash as V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's lack of attention and failure to notice the stopped vehicle in front.
