The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to turn left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, on the other hand, was traveling straight in their lane and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling-turning left at intersection," indicating that V1's actions were a contributing factor to the accident.
