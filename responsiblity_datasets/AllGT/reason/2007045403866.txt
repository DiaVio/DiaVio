The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn across the path of V2 (the Saturn LW300) without safely completing the turn. This indicates a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle (V2). Additionally, there were no skid marks reported for either V1 or V2, suggesting that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2.
