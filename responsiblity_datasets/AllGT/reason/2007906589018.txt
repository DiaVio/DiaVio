The driver of Vehicle 1 was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), exceeding the posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). Additionally, the driver failed to notice that the top of the trailer caught onto a low hanging trolley support wire, which eventually led to the pole being pulled from its cement base and falling onto Vehicle 2 (1994 Chevrolet Astro SUV). The driver of Vehicle 1's inexperience as a commercial vehicle driver, having only been licensed for four months, may have contributed to his failure to notice the cable and the resulting accident. Furthermore, the driver's lack of attention to the loud noise and the strange looks from other drivers indicates a lack of situational awareness. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's speeding, failure to notice the low hanging trolley support wire, and lack of attention to the surroundings.
