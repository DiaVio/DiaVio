The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 entered the access area and made a left turn onto the northbound roadway, heading south, while Vehicle 1 (the 2011 Toyota Avalon 4-door sedan) was approaching from the south in the right, northbound travel lane. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way and made an improper turn, resulting in the head-on collision with Vehicle 1.
