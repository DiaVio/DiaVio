The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 rolled the stop sign and entered the intersection without properly checking for oncoming traffic. - V1 hesitated in the intersection instead of proceeding across, causing confusion for other drivers. - V1's view of the eastbound lanes was obstructed by trees in the median, which may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance. - V1 was engaged in conversation with passengers and may have been fatigued from previous activities, potentially affecting her alertness and decision-making. These factors indicate that V1's actions and lack of proper surveillance were the main contributing factors to the accident.
