The investigating officer listed V1 as exceeding a reasonably safe speed, which was a contributing factor to the accident. V1 failed to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2, subsequently pushing V2 into the rear of V3. This indicates that V1 was unable to respond to the unexpected actions of the vehicles ahead, suggesting a lack of attention or failure to maintain a safe following distance.
