The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it mounted the east barrier curb, struck a large tree, and rotated counterclockwise before coming to rest facing north. This indicates that V1 veered off the road and collided with the tree, suggesting that the driver lost control of the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that the driver sustained multiple moderate injuries further supports the notion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
