The evidence indicates that V1 crossed the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1997 Ford F-150 pickup). This crossing of the centerline by V1 is considered a critical pre-crash event and was attributed to a driver-related factor, although the specific type of driver error is unknown. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain their lane and crossing into oncoming traffic.
