The reason for this is that V2 was attempting an illegal maneuver by making a U-turn at the intersection. The driver of V2 stated that he checked his rearview mirror before initiating the turn, but he failed to notice V1 (the 1995 Honda Civic) traveling in the second lane. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness on the part of the V2 driver. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," further supporting the fact that V2 encroached into the lane of V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the illegal maneuver and failure to observe the presence of V1.
