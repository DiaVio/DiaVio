The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the red light at the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1. V2 admitted to being distracted by reading the navigation device and mistakenly believed that he had the green light. Additionally, V2 was inexperienced with this particular roadway, which may have contributed to his failure to stop for the traffic control device. V1, on the other hand, had the right of way as the light turned green in their direction. The driver of V1 assumed that V2 would stop for the red light, but this assumption does not absolve V2 of their responsibility to obey traffic laws and signals. Therefore, V2's failure to stop for the red light and their distraction from the navigation device make them primarily responsible for the accident.
