The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 did not stop in time to avoid striking V2 (the Hyundai Sonata) in the rear. V2 was already stopped in lane one, waiting behind V3 (the Chevrolet Cavalier) to make a right turn. V1's failure to stop in time indicates driver inattention, which is the critical reason for the pre-crash event in V1.
