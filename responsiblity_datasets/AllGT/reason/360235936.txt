The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that departed from its lane and impacted the concrete barrier. The tire contact mark on the barrier indicates that V1's front right corner and tire ramped up the side of the barrier, causing the vehicle to rollover into the eastbound lanes. This suggests that V1 was not able to negotiate the curve in the roadway and failed to maintain control, resulting in the collision and subsequent rollover.
