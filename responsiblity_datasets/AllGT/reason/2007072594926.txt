The reason for V1's responsibility is that it experienced a fire that started in the engine compartment, leading to the vehicle traveling off the right side of the road and striking the jersey barrier. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other (fire - started in engine compartment)" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "vehicle related factor; transmission/engine failure." This indicates that the failure of the transmission or engine in V1 was a contributing factor to the crash. Since V1 was the vehicle involved in the crash and the fire originated from its engine compartment, it can be concluded that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
