The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 17-year-old male, was inexperienced and it was his first time driving in the snow. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was V1 losing control due to traveling too fast for the snowy conditions. These factors indicate that V1's driver failed to adjust his driving behavior to the slippery road conditions, leading to the loss of control and subsequent collision with a tree.
