The driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by turning left from the wrong lane. The driver of V1 was only legally allowed to make a right turn or go straight, and should have been in the second lane to make the left turn. This decision error and illegal maneuver led to the collision with V2 (the 2007 Toyota Camry). Additionally, factors such as inattention and inadequate surveillance were associated with the driver of V1.
