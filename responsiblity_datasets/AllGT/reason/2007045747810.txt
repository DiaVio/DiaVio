The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver reported that she stopped at the stop sign, looked both ways, and saw no one coming. However, she did not see V2 (the 1998 Ford F150) approaching from the southbound lane. This indicates a failure to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1's driver was inexperienced, being only 17 years old. Inexperience can contribute to a lack of judgment and decision-making skills, which may have played a role in the driver's failure to properly assess the situation. While V2 also had factors associated with the accident, such as the presence of a large truck ahead of him and a sightline restriction caused by the turning truck, V1's failure to adequately survey the intersection and make a safe left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
