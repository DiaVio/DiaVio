The driver of V1 was distracted by looking at a map, which caused him to drift off the road and into the opposing traffic lane. This distraction, combined with the driver's slight impairment due to alcohol and his unfamiliarity with the road, led to the vehicle leaving the roadway and ultimately crashing into a tree stump and coming to rest in a drainage basin.
