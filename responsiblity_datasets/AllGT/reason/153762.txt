The reason for this is that V2 lost control on the icy surface and crossed the median, re-entering the freeway in the left eastbound lane. This action caused V2 to engage with V1 in a narrow-frontal configuration, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V2's loss of control and subsequent re-entry onto the road caused the accident.
