The reason for this is that V2 initially went off the southbound travel lane, contacted the guard rail, and then re-entered the southbound travel lane before crossing over the center line into the northbound travel lane. V2 then went off the road to the left and contacted the bridge wall, redirecting it back into the southbound travel lane where it collided with the front of V1. This sequence of events indicates that V2 was the vehicle that deviated from its lane and caused the collision with V1.
