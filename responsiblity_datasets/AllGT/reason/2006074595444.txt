The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to notice that the traffic signal was red due to inattention or daydreaming. This indicates a lack of focus and awareness while driving, which directly contributed to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2006 Dodge Dakota) was not at fault as the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 was following the traffic rules and was not responsible for the collision. In summary, V1's inattention and failure to notice the red traffic signal make them primarily responsible for the accident.
