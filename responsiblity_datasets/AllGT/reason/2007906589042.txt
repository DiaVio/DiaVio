The driver of Vehicle 1 was distracted and emotionally upset, looking outside the vehicle to locate a known street and becoming hysterical and hyper. He admitted to being on medication for his mental state, which can cause extreme mood swings. Additionally, he did not have a valid driver's license. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not in a suitable mental state to be operating a vehicle safely. Furthermore, the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle 1 indicates that the driver made a recognition error due to external distraction. He was focused on street signs and directions instead of paying attention to the road and the vehicle in front of him. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distracted and emotionally unstable state, lack of a valid driver's license, and failure to recognize the presence of the vehicle in front of him.
