The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the back of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder. V1's front bumper impacted the back of V2, indicating that V1 was following too closely and did not leave enough space to react and stop safely.
