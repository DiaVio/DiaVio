The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right and began rotating clockwise, ultimately resulting in the left rear wheel contacting a sewer pipe in a ditch, causing the wheel to brake off and the vehicle to roll over. The driver of V1 claimed that the tie rod broke, but there was no evidence of this prior to the crash. The police reported that the critical reason for the crash was a driver-related factor, specifically poor directional control. Therefore, V1 is responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid departing the roadway.
