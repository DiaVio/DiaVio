The reason for this is that V2 was traveling through the intersection while the traffic signal was red for her direction of travel. The driver admitted to daydreaming and not paying attention to the traffic signal. This driver-related factor of inattention led to V2 crossing over the intersection and colliding with V1, which had the right of way.
