The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize the large blue trailer of V2 (2003 Volvo Tractor) slowing down in front of them. Despite V2 decelerating and the heavy traffic conditions, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2's trailer. This indicates a driver-related factor of unknown recognition error on the part of V1.
