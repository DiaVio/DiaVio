The reason for this is that V2 was traveling west on the intersecting street and entered the intersection, impacting the left side of V1, the 2013 Subaru Forester, which was traveling south in the southbound lane. V2's impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, V2's impact resulted in the deployment of V1's frontal, left side impact, and both side curtain airbags, indicating a significant impact from V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to yield the right of way.
