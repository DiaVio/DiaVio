The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than V1 and was not paying attention to the road ahead. The driver of V2 admitted to looking at a previous crash on the right side of the roadway and a building on the right side, which caused him to take his attention away from the traffic ahead. When he finally directed his attention back to the roadway, he noticed the traffic ahead and braked hard to avoid a crash. However, it was too late, and V1 collided with the back of V2. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe speed and keep a proper lookout for traffic ahead makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
