The driver of V1 admitted that she was distracted by looking at a previous crash and failed to notice that traffic had stopped ahead. This recognition error and external distraction caused her to strike the back of V2 (1993 Jeep Cherokee). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance and pay attention to the road ahead.
