The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not notice that V2 (the 1991 Cadillac Deville) was stopped in front of them. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which states "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain proper surveillance and avoid colliding with the stopped vehicle.
