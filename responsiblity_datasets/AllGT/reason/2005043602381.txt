The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling too fast for the curve/turn on the roadway. This is evident from the fact that V1 drove off the right side of the roadway, re-entered the road while rotating counterclockwise, and then departed the left side of the road before ultimately rolling onto its roof. The police reported travel speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) indicates that V1 was likely exceeding the posted speed limit for the curve. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a restriction on her driver's license requiring her BAC to be below .04 and her vehicle to be equipped with an ignition interlock. However, the interlock had been removed from the steering assembly when the trooper arrived. Although the BAC test results are unknown, the driver admitted to consuming "a couple mixed drinks" earlier in the evening. This suggests that the driver may have been impaired at the time of the crash, further contributing to her inability to navigate the curve safely. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed for the curve and potential impairment from alcohol consumption.
