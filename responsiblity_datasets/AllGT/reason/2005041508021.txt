The driver of Vehicle #1 was cited for improper lane change, indicating that they made a decision error and misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2. This resulted in a minor sideswipe and caused Vehicle #2 to deflect into oncoming traffic, ultimately crashing into Vehicle #3. Although Vehicle #2 (the Mitsubishi Eclipse) was involved in the crash, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 as they initiated the lane change without ensuring it was safe to do so. Vehicle #2's involvement was a result of Vehicle #1's improper lane change. It is important to note that the driver of Vehicle #3 (the Pontiac GTO) was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as they were stopped at a red light and were struck by Vehicle #2 after it deflected into oncoming traffic.
