The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection without adequately checking for oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver was aware that the delivery truck obstructed their view of the intersection to the south, yet still proceeded without taking proper precautions. These actions demonstrate a lack of caution and failure to yield the right of way to V2 (the 2004 Chrysler Sebring), resulting in the collision.
