The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by the children in the van and not paying attention to the road ahead. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that Vehicle two (V2) had stopped suddenly in front of him, resulting in the rear-end collision. Additionally, V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane stopped," indicating that V1 should have been aware of the stopped vehicle ahead and taken appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
