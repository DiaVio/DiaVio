The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it departed from the north side of the driveway and struck a tree in a narrow, left-off-set mode. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the intended path, resulting in the collision with the tree. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt, which suggests a lack of proper safety precautions.
