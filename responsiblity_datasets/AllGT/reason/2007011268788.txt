The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was identified as a driver-related factor, specifically a performance error of overcompensation. Contributing factors to the crash were also identified, including conversing with a passenger and unfamiliarity with both the road and the vehicle. These factors likely contributed to the driver's inability to properly navigate the curve and resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance error and traveling too fast for the conditions.
