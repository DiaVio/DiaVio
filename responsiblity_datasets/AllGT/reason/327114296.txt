The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while making a left turn. This loss of control resulted in the vehicle accelerating and ultimately colliding with a parked straight truck. As the driver of V1, it was his responsibility to maintain control of the vehicle and execute the turn safely.
