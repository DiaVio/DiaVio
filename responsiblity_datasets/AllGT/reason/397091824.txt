The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that it struck the rear end of V3, causing V2 to jackknife and cross the centerline into the northbound travel lane. Subsequently, V1 (the case vehicle) struck V2 in the right saddle tank area. This sequence of events suggests that V2's initial collision with V3 led to the subsequent collision with V1, ultimately causing V1 to rotate and come to a rest in the grass berm. Therefore, V2's actions of striking V3 and subsequently being struck by V1 make it primarily responsible for the crash.
