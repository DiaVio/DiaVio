The reason for this is that V1 drifted off the roadway to the right, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver noticed her vehicle off the roadway but was unable to prevent the subsequent collision with the driveway berm, fence, and tree. This suggests a lack of attentiveness and/or inability to effectively steer and brake to avoid the obstacles. Furthermore, the fact that V1 crossed over both lanes of the roadway and departed the roadway to the left indicates a significant loss of control, potentially due to excessive speed or overcorrection. This further supports the conclusion that V1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
