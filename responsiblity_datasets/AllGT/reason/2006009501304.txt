The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the same lane as V1, but at a higher speed. This indicates that V2 was likely driving too fast for the wet road conditions, which contributed to the collision. Additionally, V2 fled the scene of the accident, which further suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability.
