The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included wet roads with standing water. Additionally, the rear tires of V1 had no tread, which contributed to the loss of control and hydroplaning. These factors, combined with the driver's inability to negotiate the curve safely, led to the vehicle crossing over into the opposite lane of traffic and ultimately crashing into a utility pole.
