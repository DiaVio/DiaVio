The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle that encroached into the path of V1. V2 was northbound and crossed the street, impacting the left side of V1, which was westbound. V2's driver stated that he did not see the other vehicle coming, indicating a failure to yield or properly assess the intersection before proceeding. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment," further supporting V2's responsibility for the accident.
