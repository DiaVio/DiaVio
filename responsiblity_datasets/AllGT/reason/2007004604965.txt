The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the stop sign or the flashing control signal and falsely assumed that V2 would yield the right-of-way. This indicates a failure to obey traffic laws and a lack of awareness of the intersection's traffic control devices. V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and yield to V2 resulted in the collision.
