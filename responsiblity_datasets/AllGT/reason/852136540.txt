The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed its lane, crossed the opposite lane of travel, and then departed the street over the curb. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 was not wearing a seatbelt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
