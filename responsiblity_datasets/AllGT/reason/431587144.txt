The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling northbound and proceeded straight through the intersection. However, as the driver approached the northeastern quadrant of the intersection, the vehicle traveled off the north road edge and impacted a guardrail with its front right bumper. This indicates that Vehicle 1 deviated from its intended path and failed to maintain control, resulting in the collision with the guardrail.
