The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit, which is considered traveling too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the crash, with a BAC test result of 0.11%. These factors indicate a clear disregard for safety and a failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. The driver's overcompensation and poor directional control further demonstrate their responsibility for the accident.
