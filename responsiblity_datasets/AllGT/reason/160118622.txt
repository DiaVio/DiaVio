The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 swerved to the left to avoid a slowing moving vehicle, but then overcorrected to the right, causing V1 to start a clockwise rotation. This overcorrection and subsequent loss of control led to V1 skidding off the right side of the roadway and colliding with a fire hydrant. The driver's actions of swerving and overcorrecting ultimately resulted in the accident.
