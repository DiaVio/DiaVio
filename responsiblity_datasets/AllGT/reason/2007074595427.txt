The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing. She admitted that she did not look both ways before entering the intersection and did not see V1 prior to the crash. This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in V2 encroaching into the path of V1, leading to the collision.
