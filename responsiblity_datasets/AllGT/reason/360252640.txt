The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center lane lines and traveled into the northbound lane, resulting in a frontal impact with V1. This action caused the subsequent chain of events, including the impact between V1 and V3. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain its lane and causing the initial collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
