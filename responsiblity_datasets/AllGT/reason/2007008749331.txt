The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. The driver admitted to being distracted by looking at street signs while driving, which further supports the fact that she did not see the stop sign. This driver-related factor of external distraction directly led to the critical precrash event of V1 crossing over the intersection and colliding with V2.
