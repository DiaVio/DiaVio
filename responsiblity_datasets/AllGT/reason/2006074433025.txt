The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was daydreaming about her evening plans and did not realize that V1 was stopped until it was too late to make any avoidance maneuvers. This indicates a clear driver-related factor of inattention, which led to the collision. Additionally, V2 struck the back of V1, indicating that V2 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance.
