The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a blowout of the left-front tire. The driver's attempt to correct the vehicle's path by overcompensating with steering maneuvers ultimately led to the vehicle crossing all lanes and impacting the concrete barrier. Therefore, the driver's actions and overcompensation contributed to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
