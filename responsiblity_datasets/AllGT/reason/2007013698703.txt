The driver of V1 admitted to not looking to his right before crossing the roadway, indicating inadequate surveillance and a failure to exercise caution. This lack of attention and failure to ensure the path was clear before proceeding led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he never saw V2 until the impact occurred, further highlighting his lack of awareness and responsibility. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that she never saw V1 until the collision, suggesting that she was not at fault for the crash. While there was a sightline restriction caused by the tractor-trailer in the northbound lane, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver crossing the roadway (V1) to ensure it is safe to proceed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to look before crossing the roadway.
