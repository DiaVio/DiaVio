The reason for this is that V1's trailer became unhitched after traveling over a bump in the road, causing it to cross over into the westbound lane and collide with V2. V1 continued traveling unaware of the event, indicating a lack of awareness and control over the trailer. This failure to properly secure and control the trailer ultimately led to the collision.
