The reason for this is that V1 departed the lane to the right, scraped against the curb multiple times, and then veered to the left, crossing over all four traffic lanes. V1's front left tire impacted the curb, causing minor damage, and then it continued off the roadway, impacting two trees. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
