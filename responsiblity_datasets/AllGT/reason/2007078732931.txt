The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at and talking to his son in the right front passenger seat. This distraction caused him to not notice that V2 (the 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme) was stopped in front of him, resulting in the rear-end collision. Additionally, V1's statement that he did not see any brake lights on V2 suggests that he was not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a proper lookout make them primarily responsible for the accident.
