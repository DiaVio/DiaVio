The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of 0.17, which is above the legal limit. Additionally, after the initial impact with V2, the driver of V1 attempted to leave the scene by reversing and passing V2 and V3 on the right, ultimately colliding with V4. This behavior demonstrates a disregard for traffic laws and responsibility, further supporting V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
