The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a left turn in front of V2 (the driver of the 1996 Ford Ranger compact pick-up) without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. V1 checked for oncoming traffic before starting to slow down for the left turn, but failed to look again at the oncoming travel lane prior to turning. V2 was approaching from the opposite direction and had already crested a hill, giving V1 enough time to observe and avoid the collision if they had looked again. V1's failure to properly surveil the oncoming traffic and recognize the presence of V2 led to the collision. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction-over left lane line." This indicates that V2 was driving within their lane and did not contribute to the collision. The associated factors for V2, such as their limited driving experience and unfamiliarity with the roadway, do not make them primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to recognize the presence of V2 while making a left turn.
