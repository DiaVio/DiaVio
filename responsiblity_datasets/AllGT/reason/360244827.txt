The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in lane one of the divided freeway but drove off and departed the roadway to the right. V1 then continued to track in a grassy area before impacting a shrubbery/bush and then a tree. The severe damage to V1 indicates that it was the vehicle that caused the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 sustained minor injuries and was treated and released at the hospital suggests that the driver was not at fault for the accident. The passenger in the front right position of V1 was fatally injured and fully ejected, further indicating that V1 was primarily responsible for the crash.
