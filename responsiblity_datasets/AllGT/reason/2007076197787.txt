The reason for V1's responsibility is that it slid off the icy roadway to the left while negotiating a curve. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle on the icy road surface, resulting in the vehicle colliding with the concrete wall and guardrail. The driver's inability to adapt to the slick road conditions and adjust their driving accordingly led to the crash.
