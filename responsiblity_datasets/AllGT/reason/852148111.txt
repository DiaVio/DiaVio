The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction, opposite to the flow of traffic, in lane three of the northbound lanes. The driver of V1, the 2000 Volkswagen Jetta sedan, attempted to brake but could not avoid the wrong-way vehicle. The impact occurred when the front of V1 collided with the front of V2. This indicates that V2 was in the wrong lane and caused the collision by traveling in the opposite direction. It is important to note that V1 was in the correct lane and took appropriate actions by braking to avoid the collision. The fact that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction and caused the head-on collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
