The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol with a blood/alcohol concentration of 0.30, which is significantly above the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's claim of steering to avoid a deer does not align with the evidence, as the initial right road edge departure was at a shallow angle and not consistent with sudden evasive maneuvers. The driver's over-correction after re-entering the roadway further contributed to the crash.
