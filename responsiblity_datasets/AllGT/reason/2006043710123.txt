The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions of the roadway, which was caused by a heavy rainstorm. The driver's inexperience, distraction from talking and singing with passengers, and the low tread depth of the tires all contributed to the vehicle hydroplaning and losing control. Despite attempting to regain control and lessen the impact, V1 crossed into the opposite lane and collided with V2. While V2 (the Toyota Sequoia) did encroach into the left lane to avoid the oncoming V1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to adjust their speed and driving behavior to the wet conditions.
