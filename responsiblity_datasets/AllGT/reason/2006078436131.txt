The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a left turn at the intersection without properly functioning brakes. This is evident from the fact that the brake pedal went to the floor during the vehicle inspection, indicating degraded braking capability. As a result, V1 was unable to stop or slow down adequately, leading to the collision with V2 (the 1965 Chevrolet Nova Station wagon) that was traveling northbound. While V2 attempted to avoid the crash by steering to the left and braking, the encroachment from V1's left turn made it difficult for V2 to completely avoid the collision. In summary, V1's failure to ensure proper braking capability before making a left turn at the intersection is the primary reason for their responsibility in this accident.
