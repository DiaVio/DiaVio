The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic when turning left onto the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 stated that she looked left and thought she had enough time to turn, but she was struck by V2 (the Dodge Caravan) in the left side. V1's view of V2 was obstructed by the stopped traffic in lane 1, which motioned her into the roadway. Additionally, V1 was cited for failure to yield to oncoming traffic, further indicating her responsibility in the crash.
