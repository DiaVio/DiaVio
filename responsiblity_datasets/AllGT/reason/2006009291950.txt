The driver of V1 was merging into lane one without properly assessing the traffic ahead. She was distracted by monitoring the oncoming traffic on her left using her side mirror and failed to notice that the vehicles in lane one were stopped. This resulted in her applying her brakes unsuccessfully and colliding with the rear of V2, which then propelled V2 into V3. V1's inadequate surveillance and distraction from external factors contributed to the accident.
