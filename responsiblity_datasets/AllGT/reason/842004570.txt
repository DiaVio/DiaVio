The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was the only vehicle involved in the collision. It left the roadway, struck a driveway culvert, a mailbox, and ultimately collided with a utility pole. The sustained damage across the hood and roof structure indicates that Vehicle 1 made contact with the utility pole in a non-horizontal fashion. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision.
