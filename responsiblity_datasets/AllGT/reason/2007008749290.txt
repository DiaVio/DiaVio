The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Pre-crash Event and Critical Reason stated in the report. The vehicle lost control while negotiating a curve, went off the roadway multiple times, and ultimately collided with a railing and the parked V2 (1995 Ford Windstar minivan). The estimated speed of V1 at 50 mph (80 kmph) is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 25 mph (40 kmph), indicating excessive speed. Additionally, the presence of an open can of beer in the vehicle, with a distinct smell of alcohol, suggests the possibility of impaired driving. Although alcohol was not mentioned in the police accident report, it raises concerns about the driver's sobriety and potential influence on their ability to safely operate the vehicle. Overall, the combination of excessive speed, loss of control, and potential impairment due to alcohol consumption points to V1 (the driver of the 1994 Saturn SL sedan) being primarily responsible for the crash.
