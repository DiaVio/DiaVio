The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection and intending to turn left. Additionally, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, suggesting that V2 did not properly assess the situation and failed to stop or yield when required. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and failure to stop or yield when required make it primarily responsible for the accident.
