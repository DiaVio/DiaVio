The reason for V1's responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for curve/turn." This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed of 121 kmph (75 mph), which is significantly higher than the speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) for the roadway. Additionally, the crash occurred on a curved section of the road, which requires drivers to reduce their speed to safely navigate the curve. V1's failure to adjust their speed to the conditions of the road and the curve led to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
