The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with her passenger, which was coded as a driver-related factor. This distraction caused her to fail to look far enough ahead and not anticipate the impending problem of V2 being stopped in front of her. Additionally, the heavy rush hour traffic and the sight restriction posed by the non-contact van were also contributing factors. On the other hand, V2 was not found to have contributed to the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as another vehicle in the lane traveling at the same direction with a higher speed. However, rush hour traffic and the fact that the driver of V2 was conversing with his passenger were coded as associated factors, but not as contributing factors to the crash.
