The driver of V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. This is evident from the fact that the driver stated he never saw the other car (V2) and did not execute any avoidance actions. The investigating officer estimated V1's impact and travel speeds to be higher than V2's, indicating that V1 had the opportunity to see and avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to take necessary precautions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
