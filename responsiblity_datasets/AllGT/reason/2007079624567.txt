The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it veered left onto the highway's median and subsequently lost control, causing it to collide with the guardrail, curb, barbed wire fence, and chain-linked fence. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating that V1 deviated from its lane and went onto the median. The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: overcompensation, suggesting that the driver of V1 made an excessive steering correction after being distracted by the non-contact vehicle changing lanes. This poor directional control and distraction ultimately led to the collision and subsequent rollover of V1.
