The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 admitted that she accidentally ran the red light due to being an inexperienced driver. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be 64 kmph (40 mph), which indicates that she was likely traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). On the other hand, Vehicle 2 (the Jeep Grand Cherokee) was stopped facing east in lane two, waiting to turn left. The driver of Vehicle 2 stated that the other driver ran the light and hit her. However, the investigating officer estimated her travel and impact speeds to be only 8 kmph (5 mph), which suggests that she was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running the red light and potentially speeding.
