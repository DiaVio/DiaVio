The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to stop at a traffic control device, which is an illegal maneuver. This is supported by the fact that V1 did not wait for the police after the crash and continued traveling. Since V1's actions directly led to the initial impact with Vehicle 2 (V2), they bear the primary responsibility for the crash.
