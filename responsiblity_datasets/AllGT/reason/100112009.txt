The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it veered off the roadway, crossed a mountable curb, and collided with a large pine tree on the south roadside. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and failed to navigate the curve in the road, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's statement of possibly blacking out suggests a potential medical issue or impairment that could have contributed to the loss of control.
