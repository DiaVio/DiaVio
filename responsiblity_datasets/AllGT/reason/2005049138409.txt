The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn into the business parking lot without the right of way. This indicates that V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina), who was traveling in the first travel lane. V1's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2 led to the collision.
