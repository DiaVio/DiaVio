The reason for this is that the driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the left curve, resulting in a long counterclockwise yaw that carried it across the center divider and into the northbound lanes, ultimately colliding with Vehicle 1 (V1). This indicates that the driver of V2 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle, leading to the collision with V1.
