The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. This is supported by the police-reported travel speed of both vehicles, which indicates that V1 was traveling at 24 kmph (15 mph) at the time of the crash. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason was identified as a driver-related factor of internal distraction. The driver of V1 admitted that his passenger was reading aloud directions to the client's home, indicating a potential distraction. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Chevrolet Tahoe) reported that she looked in all directions before entering the intersection and did not see V1. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, across path," and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. The only associated factor coded to the driver of V2 was inadequate surveillance. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2.
