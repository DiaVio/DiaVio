The driver of V1 ran a red light and failed to stop at the intersection, resulting in a collision with V2. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the signal or V2, indicating inattentiveness and inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the physical evidence of skid marks suggests that the driver of V1 realized well before the intersection that she needed to stop quickly but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for a red light and lack of attention to the driving task make them primarily responsible for the accident.
