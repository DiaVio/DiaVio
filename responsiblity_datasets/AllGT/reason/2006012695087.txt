The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver reported that the car stalled and the brakes went to the floor, which caused him to lose control and collide with the back of V2 (the 2001 Chevrolet Silverado). Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's Critical Precrash Event was a vehicle-related factor, specifically the failure of the brakes. This indicates that V1's vehicle malfunctioned, leading to the accident. On the other hand, V2 was stopped at a red light in the left turn lane and was not thought to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
