The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to take adequate evasive action when faced with a non-contact vehicle encroaching into her lane. Instead of braking or taking other appropriate measures to avoid a collision, V1's driver steered hard to the right, resulting in a loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately causing it to roll over. Additionally, the EDR data revealed that V1 was traveling at a speed of 80 mph (above the posted speed limit of 70 mph) and did not engage in any braking in the 5 seconds leading up to the crash. These factors, along with the driver's use of hormone-replacement medication, further contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
