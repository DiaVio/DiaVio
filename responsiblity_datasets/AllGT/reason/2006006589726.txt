The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. Despite stopping and looking to the right, V2 did not see V1 approaching from the northbound direction. This failure to properly assess the situation and recognize the need for caution led to V2 entering the intersection and colliding with V1. While V1 was traveling over the speed limit, it is important to note that V2 also admitted to exceeding the speed limit. However, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic is a more significant contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to recognize the need for caution at the intersection.
