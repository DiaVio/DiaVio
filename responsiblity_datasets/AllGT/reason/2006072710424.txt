The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling: crossing over [passing through] intersection" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to "driver related factor: internal distraction". This suggests that the driver of Vehicle one was distracted by the two dogs in the vehicle, which likely contributed to their failure to yield the right of way at the intersection. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two (2003 Ford Mustang) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, across path". The critical reason for this event was not coded to Vehicle two, indicating that Vehicle two was not primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's internal distraction.
