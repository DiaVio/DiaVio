The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event being coded as "traveling too fast for conditions" and "driver decision error: too fast for curve/turn." Additionally, the driver's own statement of speeding up to get the vehicle behind him off his tail further supports the fact that he was driving at an excessive speed. Furthermore, the driver's impaired state due to a high BAC level, fatigue, and the use of Xanax for anxiety disorder also contributed to his inability to negotiate the curve safely.
