The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were driving too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected action of V2 stopping. Additionally, the internal distraction caused by the conversation with the passenger may have contributed to the driver's delayed reaction in applying the brakes. V2, on the other hand, stopped due to an object on the roadway and was unable to attempt any avoidance maneuvers. While V2 may have been traveling at a higher speed, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not being able to react in time to the stopped vehicle ahead.
