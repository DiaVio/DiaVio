The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the GMC Yukon, was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before proceeding. The driver claimed that a delivery truck parked on the convenience store lot obstructed his view of V1, but the researcher believes that this was not a significant factor as the truck was a sufficient distance away. Additionally, the driver was not licensed, which further suggests a lack of responsibility and awareness on his part.
