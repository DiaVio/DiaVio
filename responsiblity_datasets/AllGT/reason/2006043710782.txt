The reason for V3's responsibility is that the driver of V3 admitted to being inattentive and distracted. She stated that she looked in her right side mirror at something that caught her attention, and when she looked straight again, she realized traffic was stopped and applied the brakes but couldn't stop in time before colliding with the rear of V2. This indicates that V3's inattentiveness and failure to maintain proper surveillance of the road ahead led to the collision.
