The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive or daydreaming while making a left turn. Despite looking, the driver failed to see any approaching traffic and proceeded to make the turn, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1995 Ford Ranger) was traveling within the speed limit and in their own lane, indicating that they were not at fault for the crash.
