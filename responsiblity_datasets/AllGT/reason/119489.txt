The reason for this is that V1 was stopped in the mouth of a commercial driveway, waiting to make a left turn onto a north-south two-lane, two-way road. The driver of V1 reportedly did not see Vehicle two (V2) approaching and began to enter the roadway with the intention of turning left. As a result, V2, which was traveling north in the northbound lane, collided with the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
