The driver of V1 was stopped in the left turn lane, waiting to turn left. When the traffic light turned green for north/south traffic, V1 entered the intersection to make the left turn. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn, which is coded as an "inadequate surveillance" driver-related factor. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 turning across the path of V2 (the driver of the 1993 Ford Explorer), causing the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
