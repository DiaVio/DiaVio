The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions. The driver was going downhill on a slushy and icy roadway with a 3.3 percent grade. Despite the driver's familiarity with the route and her comfort with the vehicle, she failed to adjust her speed accordingly. This resulted in V1 sliding off the road and colliding with the jersey barrier. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control, as indicated by the associated factor, further supports V1's primary responsibility. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle while attempting to brake and steer left contributed to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed for the road conditions and poor directional control.
