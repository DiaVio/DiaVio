The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted while reaching for objects inside the vehicle, causing him to be unaware of the non-contact vehicle (the mid 1990s Ford Taurus) being too close to his vehicle. When the driver looked up and saw the non-contact vehicle, he panicked and overreacted, leading to overcompensation in his steering actions. This resulted in V1 re-entering the roadway at a high rate of speed and continuing to drive into lane two, ultimately causing the rollover accident. Therefore, V1's driver's distraction and overreaction are the main factors that led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
