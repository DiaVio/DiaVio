The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 admitted to not seeing the approaching vehicle (V2) from the opposite direction while making the left turn. This lack of awareness and failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with the area and distraction from talking to passengers and listening to the radio likely contributed to the inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
