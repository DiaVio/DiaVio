The reason for this is that the driver of V1 did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. This illegal maneuver and decision error led to the collision with V2. The driver of V1 admitted to not fully stopping and stated that his vehicle's brakes were not functioning properly. However, witnesses on the scene reported that the driver of V1 drives fast through the parking lot and up the side street every day, indicating a pattern of reckless driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not looking very hard to the left before proceeding into the intersection. This lack of proper surveillance further contributed to the collision. If the driver of V1 had come to a complete stop, they would have been able to see V2 approaching and either prevent the crash or allow V2 to pass without incident. Therefore, based on the driver's illegal maneuver, inadequate surveillance, and reckless driving behavior, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
