The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and did not realize the surface of the road was frozen. This lack of awareness and failure to exercise caution led to the loss of control and subsequent accident. Additionally, the driver's incorrect use of the ABS brakes further contributed to the inability to regain control of the vehicle.
