The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, which is identified as the critical reason for the collision. The driver stated that he looked to the right to identify the source of a speeding engine noise, but did not see V1 approaching. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming traffic, leading to the collision.
