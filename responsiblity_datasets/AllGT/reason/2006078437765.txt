Reason: V1 was being pursued by law enforcement personnel and made the decision to steer right to avoid a spike strip in the roadway. This decision resulted in the left rear tire of V1 impacting the spike strip, causing the driver to lose control and roll the vehicle over. Additionally, V1 had stolen license plates and was carrying a total of eighteen occupants, which contributed to the instability of the vehicle.
