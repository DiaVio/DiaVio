The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. Vehicle 2 (the Ford Crown Victoria) was traveling straight in its lane and had the right of way. Vehicle 1 failed to yield and turned in front of Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that Vehicle 1 had inadequate tread depth on multiple tires, which could have contributed to reduced traction and control during the turn. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the failure to yield and the potential vehicle maintenance issue.
