The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
