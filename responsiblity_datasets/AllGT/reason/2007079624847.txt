The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the other driver's actions. V1 was turning left at the intersection and falsely assumed that V2 would yield the right of way. This false assumption led to V1's failure to properly judge the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was in a hurry, which may have contributed to the driver's impatience and lack of caution. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
