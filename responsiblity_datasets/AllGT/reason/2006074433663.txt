The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of 0.169, which impaired her ability to control the vehicle and make appropriate decisions. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being fatigued, having been awake for over 19 hours before the collision. This combination of alcohol impairment and fatigue likely contributed to her failure to negotiate her lane change and realize that she did not have enough distance to avoid colliding with V1.
