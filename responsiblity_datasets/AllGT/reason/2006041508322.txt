The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a sharp steering maneuver by swerving to the left to avoid a phantom vehicle, causing the vehicle to lose control and ultimately collide with the concrete barrier wall. The driver's overcompensation in response to the situation led to the loss of vehicle control, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
