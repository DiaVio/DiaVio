The driver of V1 was distracted by her cell phone conversation, which is believed to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to using her cell phone before the crash and did not remember any details of the incident due to shock. This distraction likely caused her to fail to notice that V2 (the Ford Focus) had slowed down for the red light and was beginning to accelerate when the light turned green. V1 then made contact with the back of V2.
