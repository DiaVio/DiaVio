The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction. V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. This indicates a lack of attention or following too closely, which is a driver error. Additionally, the fact that V1 traveled off the left side of the highway and struck a delineator pole and guardrail suggests a loss of control, further indicating that V1 was not driving in a safe and responsible manner. It is important to note that the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident, as V1 was the one who struck the back of V2. Overall, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to maintain control of their vehicle.
