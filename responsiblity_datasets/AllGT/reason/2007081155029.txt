The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and the curve, which caused the loss of control and subsequent crash. Additionally, the presence of an open beer in the driver's cup holder and a case of beer found at the scene suggests that alcohol consumption may have been a contributing factor. The driver's statement that he had not eaten all day and was in a hurry to get home to cook dinner also indicates a potential lack of focus and impaired judgment.
