The reason for this is that V1 disregarded the traffic signal, which was in flashing red mode due to a power outage. This illegal maneuver by V1 led to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1999 BMW 328i sedan) and subsequently caused the collision with V3 (the driver of the 2004 Isuzu NPR TB medium/heavy straight truck).
