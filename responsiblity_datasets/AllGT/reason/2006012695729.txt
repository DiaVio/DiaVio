The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at excessive speed, as reported by a witness who claimed V1 was traveling in excess of 137 kmph (85 mph) prior to the crash. This excessive speed caused V1 to lose control of the vehicle, drift off the roadway, and overcorrect, resulting in a rollover. The driver's overcompensation and inability to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the crash. Additionally, factors such as driver fatigue and work stress due to a recent change in schedule may have contributed to the driver's inability to react appropriately in the situation.
