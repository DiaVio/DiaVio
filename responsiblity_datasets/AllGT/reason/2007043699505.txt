The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 56 kmph (35 mph), indicating that V1 did not stop for the stop sign at the intersection. Additionally, V1's critical reason for the crash was inadequate surveillance, suggesting that the driver failed to properly observe and assess the intersection before proceeding. On the other hand, V2 (the 1993 Honda Accord) stated that he was heading to work from out of town when V1 pulled in front of him, indicating that V2 had the right of way. V2's estimated travel and impact speeds were lower at 32 kmph (20 mph), suggesting that V2 was likely traveling at a reasonable speed for the conditions. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance.
