The critical precrash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the intersection before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the scene evidence suggests that V1 was attempting to avoid V2 by braking and steering right. Therefore, V2's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and ensure it was clear before making the left turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
