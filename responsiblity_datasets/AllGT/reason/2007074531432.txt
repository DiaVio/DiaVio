The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection." This indicates that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a maneuver that requires yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V2 was coded as a driver-related factor: type of driver error unknown. This suggests that there was some error or mistake made by the driver of V2, although the specific details are not provided. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident because they failed to yield the right-of-way while making a left turn at the intersection.
