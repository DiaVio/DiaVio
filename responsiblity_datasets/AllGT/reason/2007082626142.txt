The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they turned left at the intersection with an obstructed view and inadequate surveillance. V1 stated that they did not see V2 (the 1991 Toyota Tercel Sedan) due to another car that had stopped in the left-hand turn lane, and they were unable to see the oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1 admitted to being somewhat inattentive due to thinking about a future event. While V2 was encroaching over the left lane line from the opposite direction, an associated factor for V2 was assuming that any other vehicles approaching the intersection would stop at the yellow light. However, V1's failure to yield the right of way and their inadequate surveillance were the primary factors that led to the collision.
