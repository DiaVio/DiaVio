The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2000 Freightliner tractor pulling a trailer, and collided with the back of V2's trailer. V1 attempted to change lanes to the left without ensuring that it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision.
