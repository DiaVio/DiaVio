The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 ran off the right side of the road, indicating a loss of control. This action led to V1 crossing both lanes and ultimately departing the left side of the road, resulting in the collision with trees and the vehicle rolling over. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane is the main factor contributing to the accident.
