The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 lost control of the vehicle due to a sharp steering maneuver caused by a non-contact vehicle merging into V1's lane without using a signal. This sharp steering maneuver resulted in V1 rotating 90 degrees clockwise and then rolling left, ultimately making contact with the back of V2 (the 2004 GMC Yukon XL 1500 sport utility). Therefore, V1's loss of control and subsequent contact with V2 can be attributed to the actions of the non-contact vehicle merging into V1's lane, making V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
