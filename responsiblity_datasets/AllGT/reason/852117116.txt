The reason for this is that V1 drifted onto the paved shoulder and then swerved back into the northbound lane before swerving to the right again. V1 then began to yaw clockwise in the travel lane and departed the roadway to the right, ultimately rolling onto its left side after hitting a light pole and swiping tree branches. The driver of V1 was found to be not restrained and was partially ejected from the vehicle during the rollover event. Additionally, the front seat belt pre-tensioners fired, indicating that the rollover event was severe. Therefore, based on the actions and behavior of V1, it can be concluded that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
