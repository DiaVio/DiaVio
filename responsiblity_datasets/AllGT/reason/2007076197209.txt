The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of the SUV towing the boat, which was turning right into the business drive. Despite seeing the SUV decelerating and intending to turn right, V1 believed that the SUV would not make the turn without impacting his truck. This misjudgment led V1 to accelerate and attempt to turn left, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the situation and failure to yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
