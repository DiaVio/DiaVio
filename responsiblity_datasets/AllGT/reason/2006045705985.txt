The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was distracted by reaching for his seatbelt, which caused the vehicle to depart the right side of the road. - The driver admitted to being under the influence of narcotic pain relievers, which could have impaired his ability to drive safely. - The driver's addiction to narcotic pain relievers, along with other personal problems, may have contributed to his overall state of mind and focus on the road. - Additionally, the driver was smoking a cigarette at the time of the crash, which could have further distracted him from maintaining control of the vehicle. These factors indicate that V1's driver was not fully attentive and in control of the vehicle, leading to the crash.
