The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to changing lanes from lane 2 to lane 3 and then braked with lockup, resulting in a collision with the back of Vehicle 2 (the Nissan Xterra). The estimated impact speed of Vehicle 1 was 56 kmph (35 mph), which indicates that the driver was traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). Additionally, the Critical Reason assigned to Vehicle 1 was a driver-related factor of misjudgment of gap or other's speed, along with poor directional control and misjudgment factors. These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to properly assess the distance and speed of Vehicle 2, leading to the collision.
