The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related decision error by taking incorrect evasive action. The driver admitted to traveling at a high speed of 75 mph (113 kmph) when the non-contact vehicle merged in front of him and decelerated. Instead of maintaining control and braking appropriately, the driver swerved left and attempted to use both the foot brakes and parking brake simultaneously, which resulted in losing traction and ultimately crashing into a tree. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
