The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while negotiating the curves, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle. This is supported by the fact that V1 departed the roadway to the right and then veered out of control in a counter-clockwise rotation, ultimately colliding with V2 (the 1995 Ford Windstar). The driver of V1's claim of amnesia and the presence of driver fatigue further indicate her responsibility for the crash. On the other hand, the driver of V2 noticed V1 coming towards him in the opposite direction and intentionally pulled over and stopped his vehicle to avoid a collision. V2 was not at fault for the crash as he took appropriate action to avoid the oncoming vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's fatigue, falling asleep, and subsequent loss of control.
