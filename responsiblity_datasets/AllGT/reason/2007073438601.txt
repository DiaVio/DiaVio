The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop in time and collided with the back of V2, which was stopped in order to make a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she applied the brakes when she saw V2 stopped, but the brakes failed due to a ruptured brake line. This indicates a vehicle-related factor that contributed to the accident. While V2 was stopped in the lane, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle, suggesting that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident.
