The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the witness stated that V1 entered the intersection at full speed without slowing down, even though the light had been solid red for quite some time. This indicates that V1 failed to stop for the traffic control device, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, there is no interview data available for V1 to determine any other associated factors. On the other hand, V2 (the Acura TL) was stopped at the light facing south and began to accelerate into the intersection when his light turned green. The driver of V2 believed that V1 was in lane one (right curb lane) as he entered the intersection. V2's critical reason for the critical event was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that V2 did not see the other vehicle before the impact. However, witnesses at the scene supported V2's claim that he did not run the red light. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to stop for the traffic control device.
