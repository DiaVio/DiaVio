The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound and had a light that was changing to red at the intersection, but proceeded through. This indicates a decision error and an illegal maneuver on the part of the driver of V1. By running a red light, V1 failed to yield the right of way to V3, who was traveling eastbound with a green light. Additionally, V1's left rear wheel struck V2 over the right front, indicating that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper distance and avoid a collision. V1 then struck the traffic light and crossed over the double yellow lines, further demonstrating a lack of control and disregard for traffic laws. Overall, V1's decision to run a red light and subsequent actions caused the collision and makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
