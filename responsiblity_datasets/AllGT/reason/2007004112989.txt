The driver of V1 was unable to stop in time and struck the rear of V2, which then pushed V2 into the rear of V3. The driver of V1 stated that he attempted to stop but was unsuccessful due to the wet roads. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and/or traveling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
