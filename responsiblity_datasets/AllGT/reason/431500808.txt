The reason for this is that V1 was traveling westbound and drifted into the adjacent outboard lane, entering the intersection in a forward tracking mode. V1 then collided with a W-beam guardrail, continued across the southbound lanes, and ultimately crashed into an iron fence, the asphalt surface of a parking lot, and the brick face of a building. The driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and allowed it to drift into other lanes and collide with multiple objects, resulting in the series of events leading to the accident.
