The reason for this is that V2 was making an illegal U-turn at the intersection, which is a violation of traffic laws. V2 assumed that Vehicle one (V1) would yield and allow him to complete the U-turn, but this assumption was false. V2 failed to ensure sufficient clearance before proceeding with the U-turn, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, V2 was driving with a suspended license and expired emission/inspection stickers, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic regulations. Therefore, V2's actions of making an illegal U-turn and driving with violations make them primarily responsible for the accident.
