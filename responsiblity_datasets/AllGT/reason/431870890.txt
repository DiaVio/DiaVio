The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted off the road and departed the left road edge, entering the center median. It then collided with multiple trees, resulting in severe damage to the vehicle and causing serious injury to the driver. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lanes indicates that Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
