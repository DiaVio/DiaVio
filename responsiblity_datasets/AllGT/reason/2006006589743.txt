The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by adjusting his two-way radio, which was an internal distraction. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) had entered his lane and was decelerating. As a result, V1 was unable to brake in time to avoid colliding with V2. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as the crash occurred in a construction zone with heavy traffic flow. This indicates that V1 did not realize the caution required in such a situation. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to adjust his driving behavior to the conditions make him primarily responsible for the crash.
