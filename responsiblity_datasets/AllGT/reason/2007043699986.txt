The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not watching the road. He admitted to attempting to clean up a spilled drink while driving, which caused him to veer into the oncoming lane of travel. This distraction led to a loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately resulted in the crash. Additionally, the driver was conversing with his passengers, which further contributed to his lack of attention on the road.
