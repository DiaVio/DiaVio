The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 2002 Honda Accord). V1's inadequate surveillance resulted in V2 colliding with the right side of V1's vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn is the primary cause of the accident.
