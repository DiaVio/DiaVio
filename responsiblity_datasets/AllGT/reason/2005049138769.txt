The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a left turn across the path of V1 (the driver of the 2002 Honda Civic) without a protected turn arrow. V2's view of V1 was obstructed by a non-contact vehicle in the northbound turn lane, but it is still the responsibility of V2 to ensure that it is safe to make the turn. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
