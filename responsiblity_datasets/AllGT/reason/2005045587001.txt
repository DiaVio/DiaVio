The truck driver misjudged the gap or the speed of the vehicles ahead of him, assuming that they were going faster than they actually were. This misjudgment led to him being unable to stop in time and subsequently rear-ending Vehicle #1 (the Windstar), causing a chain reaction that also resulted in a sideswipe with Vehicle #2 (the Odyssey). The truck driver was charged with following too closely, indicating his responsibility for the crash.
