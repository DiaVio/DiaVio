The reason for this is that V2 struck the back of V1 while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction. V2 was the vehicle in motion and failed to stop or slow down in time to avoid the collision with V1, which was stopped at the red traffic signal. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," indicating that V2 had the opportunity to see V1 and react accordingly. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown," suggesting that the specific error made by the driver of V2 is unclear. Therefore, based on the available information, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop or avoid colliding with the stopped vehicle in front of them.
