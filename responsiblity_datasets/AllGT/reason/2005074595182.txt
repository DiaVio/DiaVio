The driver of V1 stopped in the travel lane with the intention of turning left, but failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. This is evident from the fact that the critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as "inadequate surveillance." Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she looked but did not see the other vehicle (V2) approaching from the opposite direction. Furthermore, the driver of V1 appeared to be under the influence of either alcohol or drugs during the interview, and her medical history revealed that she had low blood sugar along with antidepressants and pain medication in her system. These factors may have impaired her ability to operate the motor vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and potential impairment caused by her medical condition and medication.
