The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by retrieving lottery tickets from the seat beside him, which caused him to pass through the intersection without stopping. Additionally, the driver had taken morphine a few hours before the crash and stated that he believed he blacked out from the medication. These factors indicate that the driver was not fully alert and focused on the task of driving, leading to the collision with the house. The driver was also charged with multiple offenses, including driving under the influence (5th offense), driving on a revoked license, and failure to stop at a stop sign.
