The driver of V1 crossed over the center double yellow lines and collided with V2 (the 2003 Kenworth dump truck) traveling in the opposite direction. This indicates that V1 was driving in the wrong lane, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, V1 failed to notice that the traffic ahead was stopped due to ongoing construction, which suggests a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver. While V2 was involved in the accident, there is no evidence to suggest that the driver of V2 could have done anything to avoid the collision. V2 was traveling in the correct lane and there is no indication of any contributing factors on their part. V3 (the 2002 Pontiac Grand Am) was stopped in the northbound lane due to construction and was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, V3 is not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to crossing over the center double yellow lines and failing to notice the stopped traffic ahead.
