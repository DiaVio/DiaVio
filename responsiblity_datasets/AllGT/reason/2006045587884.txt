The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 crossed over into the oncoming lane and struck the front left corner of Vehicle #2 (the Chevrolet Cavalier). The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with failure to maintain lane, indicating that they were at fault for not staying within their designated lane. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not able to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Factors such as inexperience, poor directional control, rain, and the curvature of the road were also mentioned as contributing factors. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was traveling in its own lane and was not encroaching into the oncoming lane. The driver of Vehicle #2 reported that the bus came over into her lane, resulting in the collision. However, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to Vehicle #2, indicating that the driver of Vehicle #2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, Vehicle #1 (the school bus) is primarily responsible for the accident due to crossing over into the oncoming lane and failing to maintain lane control.
