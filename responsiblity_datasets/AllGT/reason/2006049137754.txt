The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the police report stating that V1 lost control due to traveling too fast. Additionally, V1 failed to look far enough ahead and was not aware of the traffic conditions ahead. When the car in front of V1 slowed down, V1 made a poor choice of evasive actions and overcompensated, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately colliding with the concrete traffic barrier. V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) was not involved in the first harmful event and therefore cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
