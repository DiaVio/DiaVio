The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 departed the right-side of the road due to poor visibility, indicating a lack of proper control and attention to the road conditions. This resulted in V1 colliding with multiple objects, including mailboxes and a traffic sign, before ultimately striking a utility pole. The driver's attempt to return to the road was unsuccessful due to the deep snow, leading to a counter-clockwise yaw and the final collision with the utility pole.
