The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 misjudged the speed of V2 (the 1996 Dodge Ram van) and failed to take adequate avoidance action. V1 was traveling at a speed of 89kmph (55 mph), which was higher than the speed of V2, which was reported to be between 16-24kmph (10-15 mph). V1's driver stated that she did not have time to stop or swerve because she did not expect V2 to stop in her lane. However, the witness behind V1 confirmed that V2 was driving slowly, indicating that V1 should have been able to see and avoid the slower-moving vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of V2's speed and failure to take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
