The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, but turned with an obstructed view. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 prior to the impact due to a vehicle in one of the westbound lanes. This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1999 Volvo S70) was traveling straight in the westbound lane and did not see V1 prior to the crash. While V2 may have had a responsibility to be aware of other vehicles in the intersection, the primary fault lies with V1 for turning with an obstructed view. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of turning with an obstructed view.
