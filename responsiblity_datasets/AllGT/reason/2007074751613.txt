The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to turn left at the intersection. Despite seeing V2 about half a block away, V1 believed they could safely clear the intersection, which ultimately led to the collision. Additionally, the driver's focus on their family problems and driving immediately after donating blood were associated factors that likely contributed to their misjudgment and inability to avoid the crash.
