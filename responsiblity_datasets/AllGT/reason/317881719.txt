The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to notice V1 (the 2014 Kia Forte) slowing down while attempting to enter the left turn lane. As a result, V2's front left bumper made contact with the rear right bumper of V1, pushing V1 across the left turn lane and into the opposing northbound lane. This initial impact caused V1's front to collide with the front of V3 (the 1999 Isuzu Trooper). Therefore, the failure of the driver of V2 to notice and react to the slowing of V1 is the primary cause of the crash.
