The driver of vehicle one admitted to being distracted by papers that fell off the back seat, causing him to reach back and fix them. This distraction led to V1 departing the roadway and ultimately crashing into a mailbox and a speed limit sign. The driver's internal distraction directly contributed to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. Therefore, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
