The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 failed to see V1 before the collision occurred. The driver of V2 stated that he was looking at the driver who waived him out and then looked to his right for oncoming traffic. This indicates that the driver of V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice V1 approaching in the left turn lane. Additionally, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V2 was coded as an other recognition error, indicating that the driver's failure to recognize the impending problem was masked by the traffic flow pattern. Therefore, V2's inattention and failure to properly observe the traffic in lane two led to the collision.
