The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling eastbound. V2 stated that he stopped at the stop sign as required, but then proceeded into the intersection where V1 was struck on its left side by the front of V2. This indicates that V2 did not properly assess the situation and made an error in judgment, resulting in the collision.
