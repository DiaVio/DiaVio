The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 attempted to pass V2 without realizing that V2 was making a left turn. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1, as they should have been aware of V2's intention to turn left, especially considering V2's flashing amber caution lights and slow-moving vehicle sign. While V2's lack of rearview mirrors and turn signals may have contributed to the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the adjacent lane. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the encroachment, and therefore, V2's actions do not contribute significantly to the primary responsibility for the accident.
