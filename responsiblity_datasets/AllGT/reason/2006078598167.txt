The reason for this is that V2, the Ford Ranger pickup, made a false assumption about the actions of V1, the Honda Accord. V2 driver assumed that V1 would stop when the light turned yellow and proceeded to make a left turn without yielding the right of way to V1. This false assumption led to the collision between the front of V1 and the right side of V2.
