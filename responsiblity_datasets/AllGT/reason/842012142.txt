The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection to turn left across the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1999 Ford Econoline van), resulting in a collision. Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was proceeding straight on approach to the intersection. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to follow the traffic rules, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
