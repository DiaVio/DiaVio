The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by a 62-year-old male, entered the intersection from the east and collided with Vehicle 2 (the 2001 Hyundai Elantra), which was traveling southbound. Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck the left side plane of Vehicle 2 within the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
