The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not realize that she was too close to the forward vehicle (V2). This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the V1 driver, which led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 is currently under treatment for a seizure disorder, although she claims to not have had an attack in years. While this may not have directly contributed to the crash, it raises concerns about her overall ability to safely operate a vehicle.
