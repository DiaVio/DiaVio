The reason for this is that V1 did not stop completely at the four-way stop intersection, which is a violation of traffic rules. V2 (the driver of the 2001 Chevrolet Blazer) stated that she stopped at the stop sign and looked both ways before proceeding, assuming that V1 was going to stop. However, V1 failed to yield the right-of-way and proceeded through the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had been on the road all day and was fatigued. Fatigue can impair a driver's judgment and reaction time, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to stop at the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right-of-way.
