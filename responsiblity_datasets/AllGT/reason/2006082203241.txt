The reason for this is that V1 made an illegal maneuver by turning left from the right lane. This action violated traffic rules and created a dangerous situation for other vehicles on the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the taxi approaching from behind, indicating inadequate surveillance and a failure to check the adjacent travel lane. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and failure to properly check for approaching traffic make them primarily responsible for the collision.
