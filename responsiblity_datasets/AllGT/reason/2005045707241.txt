The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that it slid through its stop sign into the intersection and then attempted an avoidance maneuver, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2 (2000 Pontiac Sunfire). Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign, which led to the accident. Additionally, the associated factors such as wet roads, steep grade, oil on the road, and low tread on the front tires of Vehicle #1 contributed to the inability to stop or maneuver safely. Vehicle #2, on the other hand, had the right of way on the arterial road and was unable to avoid the collision due to the sudden movement of Vehicle #1. The only associated factors for Vehicle #2 were rain and a shrubbery sight line restriction, which did not contribute significantly to the accident. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way at the stop sign and the associated factors that affected its ability to stop or maneuver safely.
