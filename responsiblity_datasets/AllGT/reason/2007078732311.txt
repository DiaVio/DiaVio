The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver turned left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver admitted to stopping for about 2 seconds to turn left and stated that there were signs in the roadway that prevented her from seeing the other car coming. This indicates that V1 failed to adequately assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 2005 Honda Accord) also mentioned road signs in the roadway that made it difficult to see traffic coming the other way, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction over the left lane line. This suggests that V2 was driving within their lane and did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
