The reason for this is that V2 was traveling south on a two-lane road controlled by a stop sign, indicating that V2 had the duty to yield to any oncoming traffic. V2 attempted to cross the eastbound lanes without yielding to V1, which was approaching the intersection in an attempt to crossover. The front of V1 contacted the right front of V2, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
