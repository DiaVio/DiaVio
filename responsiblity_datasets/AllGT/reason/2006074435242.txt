The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by another vehicle passing her in lane two while she was negotiating a sharp right-hand turn. This distraction caused her to depart from the roadway on the right side and collide with a wooden utility pole. Additionally, the driver was engaged in a conversation with her front passenger regarding her concern for the passing vehicle. The driver's external distraction and lack of focus on the road led to the collision.
