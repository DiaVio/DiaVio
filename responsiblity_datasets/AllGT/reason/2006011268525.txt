The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by changing the radio station, which caused him to briefly look down. As a result, he failed to notice that V2 (the driver of the 2004 Toyota Sequoia) was stopped in the road ahead of him. Despite attempting to swerve and brake, V1 was unable to avoid colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper surveillance ahead of him led to the accident, making him primarily responsible.
