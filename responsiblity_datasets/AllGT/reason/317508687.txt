The driver of V1 was attempting to pass a non-contact vehicle at a high rate of speed while negotiating a left curve. This action indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and exercise caution while maneuvering. Additionally, the driver's unsuccessful attempt to regain control by steering right and applying brakes suggests a lack of proper response to the situation. These factors ultimately led to V1 losing control, colliding with a ditch, rolling down an embankment, and sustaining disabling damage. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to maintain control and exercise caution while attempting to pass the non-contact vehicle.
