The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the occupant of V1 was involved in a severe frontal impact with a vertical barrier post. The injuries sustained by the occupant, such as the chest contusion, hip contusions, knee contusions, and rib fractures, are all consistent with seat belt loading and contact with the steering wheel rim. Additionally, the presence of a subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and other head injuries suggest that the occupant's head made contact with the steering wheel rim or passed through the deployed frontal airbag. Therefore, based on the injuries sustained and the dynamics of the crash, V1 (the Ford Ranger) is primarily responsible for the accident.
