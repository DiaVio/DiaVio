The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn from the northbound left turn lane, intending to depart the intersection in a westerly direction. However, V2 failed to yield the right of way to the oncoming southbound traffic, specifically the case vehicle (V1) and POV 2 (V3). V2 struck the left side of V3, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest in the middle of the southbound lanes. V2 then continued forward and struck the case vehicle in the left side, causing significant damage and crushing the left side of the vehicle. The impact also caused V2 to roll over onto its right side and crash through a chain link fence, coming to rest in a front yard. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and causing multiple collisions with other vehicles indicates its primary responsibility for the crash.
