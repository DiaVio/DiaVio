The reason for this is inadequate surveillance on the part of V2 driver. V2 driver stated that she never saw V1 coming, indicating a failure to properly observe the intersection before making the left turn. Additionally, an associated vehicle factor coded to V2 was a significantly over inflated front left tire, which may have affected the vehicle's handling and ability to maneuver safely. Therefore, V2's failure to adequately survey the intersection and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
