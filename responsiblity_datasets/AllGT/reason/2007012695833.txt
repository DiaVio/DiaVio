The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V2 stated that she had looked both ways and did not see any vehicles before starting to proceed. However, when she looked left again, she saw V1 and attempted to steer right and apply the brakes but could not avoid the collision. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper surveillance and failed to notice the approaching V1 in time to avoid the accident.
