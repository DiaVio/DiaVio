The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver let his foot slip off the brake, causing his vehicle to travel into the intersection. This action resulted in the collision with V2 (the 2001 Toyota Tacoma) that was already in the intersection, negotiating a left turn with a green arrow. V1's failure to maintain control of his vehicle and stop at the intersection, combined with the distraction caused by the presence of the motorcycle patrol officer, led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
