The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the interaction between the pedestrian and the occupants of the non-contact vehicle. This distraction caused V1 to fail to notice that their traffic signal was red. As a result, V1 attempted to pass through the intersection when it was not their right of way, leading to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1990 Plymouth Acclaim) had the right of way as their traffic signal had turned green. They proceeded into the intersection in accordance with the traffic rules. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
