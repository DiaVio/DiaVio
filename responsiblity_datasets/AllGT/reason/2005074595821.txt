The driver of V1 was operating the vehicle without a driver's license and had limited experience driving this particular vehicle. Additionally, the driver noticed that the brakes on V1 were spongy, indicating a potential issue with the braking system. Despite these factors, the driver made multiple lane changes and ultimately drove off the roadway to the right, resulting in a collision with a concrete pole. The driver's lack of experience and unfamiliarity with the vehicle, combined with the degraded braking capability, contributed to the accident.
