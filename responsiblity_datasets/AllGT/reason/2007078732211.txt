The reason for V1's responsibility is that they made a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Plymouth Breeze) without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 stated that they saw V2 approaching in the number one lane and thought that V2 was going to stop. However, V2 had the right of way as they were traveling straight in their lane and V1 should have yielded to oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
