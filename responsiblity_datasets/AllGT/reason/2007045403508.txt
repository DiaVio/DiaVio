The reason for this is that V1, the unknown tractor/trailer, attempted to change lanes from lane two to lane one without sufficient clearance. This action resulted in the right side of V1 striking the left rear of V2, causing V2 to lose control and collide with the concrete barrier. Additionally, V1 briefly stopped on the right shoulder but then fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions.
