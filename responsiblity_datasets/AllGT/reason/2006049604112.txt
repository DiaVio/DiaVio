The reason for V1's responsibility is that they overcompensated while trying to avoid a collision with another vehicle that cut into their lane. This overcompensation led to the loss of control of the vehicle, causing it to veer off the road, impact the concrete wall, and ultimately come to rest partially on the shoulder and partially in lane one. Additionally, the presence of skid marks leading from lane two to the concrete wall suggests that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and made sudden braking and steering maneuvers, further contributing to the loss of control. Therefore, V1's actions and overcompensation resulted in the accident, making them primarily responsible.
