The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 experienced a driver-related factor, specifically an unknown critical non-performance error. The driver stated that she could not remember any parts of the crash and could not even recall where the crash had occurred. This suggests a lapse in attention or awareness on the part of the driver, leading to V1 departing the roadway on the right side and subsequently causing the crash. Additionally, the driver's medical conditions of depression and anxiety, along with the use of prescription medications, may have contributed to her impaired driving abilities. Overall, the driver's inability to recall the crash and the presence of driver-related factors indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
