The driver of V2 admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel, possibly due to untreated sleep apnea and fatigue. This indicates that the driver was not alert and in control of the vehicle, leading to the failure to stop at the traffic signal and colliding with V1. The driver's fatigue and sleepiness contributed to the critical pre-crash event of V2 crossing over the intersection. Therefore, V2's actions and condition directly caused the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
