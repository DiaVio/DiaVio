The driver of V1 stated that she assumed the light was green and proceeded to make a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to look or see the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1999 Oldsmobile Alero).
