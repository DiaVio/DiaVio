The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they swerved right to avoid hitting a family of ducks, which caused them to lose control of their vehicle. This action of swerving and overcompensating led to V1 crossing two travel lanes, hitting the Jersey barrier, and ultimately causing the collision. Additionally, the driver reported that the vehicle had degraded brakes, which could have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1's actions of swerving and overcompensating, along with the reported degraded brakes, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
