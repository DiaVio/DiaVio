The reason for this is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which resulted in a loss of control of the vehicle. The driver admitted to knowing that the roadway was icy and attempted to regain control by steering left and right, but was ultimately unable to do so. This indicates that the driver failed to adjust their speed to match the conditions, leading to the fishtailing and subsequent rollover of the vehicle.
