The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two stated that he waited for the traffic to clear before crossing the intersection, indicating that he had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. However, he failed to see Vehicle one (2006 Honda CR-V) approaching and proceeded to cross the intersection, resulting in the collision. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance, as he looked but did not see the approaching vehicle.
