The driver of V1 entered the intersection on a red light, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver admitted to being inattentive and failing to notice V2 entering the intersection. The driver's assumption that the light would be green based on prior experience is not a valid excuse for disregarding the actual traffic signal. While the driver of V2 (the Ford F-150) failed to look to his left and detect V1 prior to entering the intersection, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for running a red light and causing the collision.
