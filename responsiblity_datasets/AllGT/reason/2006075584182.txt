The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Nissan Xterra). The driver of V1 assumed that V2 was turning into the shopping center, rather than going straight at the intersection. This false assumption led to V1 starting the left turn and entering the northbound lanes, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and subsequent decision to turn left when it was not safe to do so makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
