The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a right curve. This indicates that the driver failed to adjust their speed to match the road conditions, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the fact that the tires on V1 were slightly over-inflated suggests that the driver did not take proper precautions to ensure the vehicle's stability on wet roads. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust speed for the wet road conditions and the curve.
