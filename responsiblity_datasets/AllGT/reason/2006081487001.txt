The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, as indicated by the critical reason coded for the crash. Additionally, the driver's blood/alcohol concentration of 0.114 suggests that they were under the influence of alcohol, which may have impaired their judgment and ability to safely navigate the curve. The fact that the driver was unfamiliar with the roadway and the weather conditions were poor further contribute to their responsibility for the collision.
