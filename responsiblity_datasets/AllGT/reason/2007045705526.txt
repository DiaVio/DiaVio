The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stop at the two-way stop sign on the north/south road, indicating a disregard for traffic regulations. - V1 did not activate the brakes before the collision, suggesting a lack of attention to the driving task. - The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by her son's phone conversation and her own smoking, further indicating inattention. - V1 crossed the intersection with an obstructed view to her left, which could have contributed to her failure to see V2 approaching from the east. - The driver of V1 had recently purchased the vehicle and had only driven it for three days, potentially indicating unfamiliarity with its handling and braking capabilities. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
