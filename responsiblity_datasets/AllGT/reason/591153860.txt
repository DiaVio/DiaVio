The driver of V1 was found to be at fault because they allowed their vehicle to travel into the westbound lane and into the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2005 Dodge Magnum coupe. This indicates a failure to maintain their lane and exercise proper control of their vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by listening to music and smoking, which likely contributed to their inability to react in time to avoid the collision. Furthermore, the impact between V1 and V2 resulted in severe damage to V1, including the shearing off of the left front wheel. This suggests that V1 made a sudden and significant movement into the path of V2, indicating a failure to yield the right of way. While Vehicle 3 (V3), the 2005 Toyota Corolla sedan, also collided with V1, it can be argued that this secondary impact was a result of the initial collision between V1 and V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1.
