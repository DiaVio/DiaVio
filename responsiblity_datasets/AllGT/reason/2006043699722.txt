The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that he looked both ways before proceeding through the intersection, but he claims that the hill crest and sun glare may have made it difficult for him to see the oncoming vehicle (V2). This indicates that V1 did not adequately assess the oncoming traffic before crossing the intersection, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 estimated that he was traveling at approximately 5 mph (8 kmph) at the time of impact, suggesting that he may not have been fully aware of the speed and distance of the approaching vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to properly survey the intersection and accurately judge the oncoming vehicle's speed and distance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
