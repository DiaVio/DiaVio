The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, while V1 was making a right turn. V2 had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic, including V1, before making the left turn. However, V2 failed to yield and collided with the front of V1. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V2 was a driver-related factor, with the specific type of driver error unknown. This suggests that the driver of V2 may have made an error while making the left turn, such as misjudging the speed or distance of V1. Furthermore, associated factors coded to V2 include a tire deficiency, with dangerously low tread on the tires, which could have affected the vehicle's handling and braking capabilities. The rush hour congestion at the time of the crash may have also contributed to the driver's decision-making and reaction time. Overall, based on the information provided, V2's failure to yield while making a left turn, along with the presence of tire deficiencies and rush hour congestion, indicates that V2 is primarily responsible for the crash.
