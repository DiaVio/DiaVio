The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted a left turn at an area where no turns were permitted, which is an illegal maneuver. This decision error led to the collision with V2 (the 2001 Suzuki GSX motorcycle). Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by eating food, as indicated by the unwrapped Subway sandwich found in the vehicle. These factors contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
