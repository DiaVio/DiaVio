The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted off the right side of the roadway, sideswiped a guardrail, and subsequently struck the back right corner of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 1 then continued to depart the right side of the roadway and collided with a guardrail end/face. These actions indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the collision.
