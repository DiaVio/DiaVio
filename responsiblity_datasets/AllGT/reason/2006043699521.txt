The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, the driver-related error of poor directional control was identified as the critical reason for the accident. V1 drifted into the centerline and impacted the left plane of the trailer being towed by V2 (the 2000 Toyota Tacoma T100 pickup). This initial impact caused V1 to continue forward and strike V3 (the 2001 Dodge Durango) head-on. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper lane position and exercise proper control of the vehicle led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
