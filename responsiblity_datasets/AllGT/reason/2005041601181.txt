The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a 79-year-old female, failed to recognize and adequately surveil the stopped truck in front of her. Despite wearing prescription lenses, she claimed not to have seen the truck due to its dark color and small lights. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to her rear-ending V2. V2 (the 2000 GMC Medium/Heavy utility truck) was stopped in the turn lane for several seconds before being struck by V1. The driver of V2 was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as he was following normal traffic flow and had taken appropriate measures by stopping in the turn lane. Therefore, V1's failure to recognize and adequately surveil the stopped truck in front of her makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
