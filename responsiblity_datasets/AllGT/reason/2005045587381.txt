The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 attempted to cross the six lanes of traffic from a private drive without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that she waited for a lengthy amount of time for traffic to clear before attempting to cross, but she failed to see Vehicle #2 (1983 Ford F-150 pickup) approaching in the left lane. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of Vehicle #1. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that Vehicle #1 pulled out in front of him and despite leaving skid marks, he was unable to avoid the collision. This suggests that Vehicle #2 was unable to react in time to the sudden appearance of Vehicle #1. However, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 as she failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and made an unsafe maneuver by attempting to cross the six lanes without ensuring it was clear.
