The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted an illegal U-turn, crossing the double yellow centerline and pulling out in front of V2. This illegal maneuver directly caused the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to be frustrated with the traffic and in a hurry to transport his passenger to a doctor's appointment, which may have contributed to his decision to make the illegal U-turn.
