The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was involved in a left plane impact with the front of another passenger car. This indicates that Vehicle 1 was attempting to make a left turn and failed to yield the right of way to the oncoming vehicle. As a result, the collision occurred, causing moderate damage to Vehicle 1 and fatal injuries to its driver.
