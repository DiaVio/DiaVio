The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is overcompensation. The driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to return to the appropriate lane after going over into the oncoming lanes. This overcompensation led to the vehicle going into a clockwise yaw, crossing the northbound lane and shoulder, and ultimately departing the right side of the road. The vehicle then struck a tree and continued to rotate before rolling over. It is important to note that the driver of Vehicle #1 was in a hurry due to being late for her work shift and had an emotional factor as her father was in the hospital in poor health. Additionally, the driver took medications for high blood pressure. However, these factors do not absolve Vehicle #1 of responsibility for the crash.
