The reason for this is that V2 was traveling west in the first lane and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling crossing over passing through intersection, reason for critical event driver related factor inadequate surveillance looked but did not see." This indicates that the driver of V2 did not properly observe the intersection and failed to see V1 (the 1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse) approaching from the south. As a result, V2 collided with the left side of V1, causing V1 to rotate and subsequently collide with V3 (the 2004 Dodge Neon).
