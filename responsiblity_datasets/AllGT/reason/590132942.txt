The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling on the wrong side of the trafficway median, which is a violation of traffic laws and poses a significant risk to other vehicles on the road. Additionally, V1 was traveling downhill while V2 (2008 Honda Pilot) was accelerating uphill, making it difficult for V2 to avoid the collision.
