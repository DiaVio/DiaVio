Reason: V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, above the posted speed limit, and made an unexpected lane change to the right, nearly colliding with a non-contact vehicle. V1 then became confused about whether to go straight or turn left at the intersection, failed to slow down or brake, and turned left from the wrong lane. V1 did not signal the turn and ran off the road, ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver of V1 admitted to consuming alcohol, Valium, marijuana, and cocaine prior to the crash, indicating impairment. Additionally, the driver's combative behavior and history of being uncooperative in previous crashes suggest a pattern of reckless behavior.
