The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, swiped rocks, and impacted a boulder, resulting in damage. V1 then continued to impact an embankment, causing the actuation of the driver's seat belt buckle pretensioner and deployment of the airbags. V1 subsequently rotated counterclockwise and rolled over before coming to a final rest on its top in the ditch. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
