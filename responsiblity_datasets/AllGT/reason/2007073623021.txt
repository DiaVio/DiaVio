The driver of V1 turned left at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 2003 Pontiac Grand Am). This was due to the presence of a school bus in the southbound lane, which obstructed V1's view. Although V2 did not realize that V1 was going to enter the intersection, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." This suggests that V2 had the right of way and V1 failed to yield, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to turn with an obstructed view and yield to oncoming traffic.
