The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at the restless child in the rear seat, which resulted in inadequate surveillance in the direction she was turning. This distraction caused her to fail to see the illegally parked V2 (the trash truck) and resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not wearing her eyeglasses, which may have impaired her vision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to driver-related factors, including distraction and inadequate surveillance.
