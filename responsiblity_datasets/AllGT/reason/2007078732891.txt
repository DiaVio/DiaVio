The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which directly led to the vehicle drifting off the roadway and ultimately crashing into a curb and a cotton field. The driver's fatigue and lack of sleep, combined with the fact that he had been awake for 25 hours after partying with friends, impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Falling asleep at the wheel is a clear violation of traffic laws and poses a significant risk to both the driver and other road users.
