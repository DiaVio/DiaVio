The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right of way while attempting to turn left. Even though the traffic light was either yellow or had just turned red, V2 was still in the middle of the intersection, attempting to clear it. The driver of V2 falsely assumed that the driver of V1 would grant them the right of way. This false assumption and failure to yield resulted in the collision between V1 and V2.
