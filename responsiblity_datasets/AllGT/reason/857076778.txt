The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curved roadway, leading to a series of steering maneuvers and oversteering. This resulted in the vehicle entering the median, tripping, and rolling into the westbound travel lanes. The driver's loss of control and subsequent rollover ultimately caused the accident.
