The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet and slick conditions caused by the light rain. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event being coded as "traveling too fast for conditions" and the critical reason being coded as "poor directional control." The driver's loss of control and subsequent overcompensation while turning left in the intersection led to the vehicle spinning out of control and ultimately colliding with a tree and a chain-link fence.
