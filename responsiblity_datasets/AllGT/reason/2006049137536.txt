The reason for this is that V1 departed the travel lane on the left side and then departed the roadway on the left side, ultimately impacting a utility pole. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene prior to emergency personnel arrival, indicating a potential attempt to avoid responsibility. Without further information on the identity of the driver or any other contributing factors, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the driver error. However, the fact that V1 veered off the road and left the scene suggests negligence or reckless behavior on the part of the driver.
