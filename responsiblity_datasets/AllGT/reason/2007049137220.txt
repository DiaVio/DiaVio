The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and departed the roadway on the left side, crossing over the median and colliding with V2 (the International Tractor). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side" and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor-poor directional control." Although V2 was in the process of changing lanes to make a left turn, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction-over left lane line." This indicates that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control and poor directional control, resulting in the collision with V2.
