The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was indicated by the driver's statement that she was traveling at approximately 64-72 KMPH (40-45 MPH) on a curve with a suggested speed of 48 KMPH (30 MPH). Additionally, the driver was inexperienced, having only had her license for 4 months, and she was fatigued from having slept only 6 Â½ hours before going to work. These factors likely contributed to her inability to properly control the vehicle and navigate the curve, resulting in the loss of control, skidding, and ultimately the crash.
