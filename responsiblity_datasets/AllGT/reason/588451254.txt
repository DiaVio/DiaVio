The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was in the dedicated left turn lane, intending to turn left at the intersection. However, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2011 Volkswagen Routan minivan) which was traveling straight through the intersection. This resulted in the collision between the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 and the front right plane of Vehicle 1.
