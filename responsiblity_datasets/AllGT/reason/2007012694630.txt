The reason for this is that V1 was driving too close to the vehicle ahead and was unable to stop in time when the vehicle in front of them made a sudden stop. This indicates a decision error on the part of V1, as they were driving too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the vehicles ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that they locked up their brakes and steered to the right, but still ended up colliding with V2 and pushing it forward into V3. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and their inability to react appropriately to the sudden stop of the vehicles ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
