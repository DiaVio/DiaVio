The reason for this is that V2 struck the right fender of the case vehicle (V1) on the left side of its front-end. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the impact. Additionally, V2 rotated clockwise through the intersection and departed the roadway, suggesting that it was the vehicle that caused the collision to occur.
