The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was attempting a left turn across the westbound lanes of the four-lane road, and failed to yield to oncoming traffic. Vehicle #2 (2003 Nissan Altima) was traveling in the right lane of the westbound direction and had the right of way. Vehicle #1 misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 had a vision impairment and was not wearing her corrective lenses as required by her license restriction. This could have contributed to her misjudgment of the oncoming vehicle's speed and distance. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure to yield and the driver's decision error and vision impairment.
