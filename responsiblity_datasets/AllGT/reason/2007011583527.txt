The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to feeling tired and passed out while driving. This resulted in V1 drifting over the centerline, failing to maintain its lane, and eventually exiting the roadway. The witness at the scene also observed V1 changing speeds and drifting over the centerline, indicating that the driver was likely drowsy or fatigued. Additionally, the driver's pre-existing medical condition of diabetes, which led to low blood sugar, is believed to have contributed to the driver passing out. The driver's failure to wear glasses as required by her driver's license restriction, prior sleep apnea condition, and lack of driver's education may have also played a role in the accident. Overall, the driver's drowsiness and subsequent loss of control of V1 are the primary factors that led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
