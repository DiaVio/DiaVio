The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to partially depart the right pavement edge and then re-directed it towards the left pavement edge, resulting in the vehicle departing the north pavement edge and entering a ravine. The driver's steering input and counterclockwise rotation ultimately led to the vehicle impacting multiple objects, including a large diameter tree, which caused severe damage.
