The driver of V1 claimed to have a yellow light and attempted to cross the intersection, but a witness stated that they observed V1 run the red light. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic control device, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the associative factors coded for V1 include illegal maneuver, misjudgment of gap, and being in a hurry, further suggesting that V1's actions contributed to the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Grand Am) was traveling eastbound and was struck by V1 while crossing the intersection. The critical reason for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to obey the traffic control device and their aggressive driving behavior.
