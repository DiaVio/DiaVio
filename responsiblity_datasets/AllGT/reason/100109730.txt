The reason for this is that the driver of V2 attempted to pass a line of slow-moving vehicles in the eastbound lane, but realized too late that he would not be able to successfully complete the maneuver. As a result, he applied his brakes hard, locking them up and sliding up to the point of impact with Vehicle One (V1). This sudden and reckless maneuver by the driver of V2 directly led to the head-on collision between the two vehicles.
