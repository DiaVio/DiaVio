The driver of V1 attempted a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the 2000 Chevrolet Corvette coupe) without yielding the right-of-way. The witness stated that the light was green for V2, indicating that V1 should have yielded before making the left turn. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor: misjudgment of gap or other's speed. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to accurately assess the speed and distance of V2, leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right-of-way and misjudgment of the oncoming vehicle's speed.
