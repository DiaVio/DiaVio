The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn across oncoming traffic, which requires yielding to oncoming vehicles. V2 (the driver of the 1995 BMW) was traveling straight through the intersection with the right of way, as indicated by the green light. V1's decision to execute the left turn while V2 was already in the intersection resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1 fled the scene, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility and accountability. Therefore, V1's decision error in executing the left turn while V2 was already in the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
