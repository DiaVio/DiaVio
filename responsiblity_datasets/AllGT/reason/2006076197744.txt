The driver of V1 was not paying attention and failed to notice that V2 and V3 had stopped to let two non-contact vehicles turn left. As a result, V1 collided with the rear of V2, causing a chain reaction where V2 then collided with the rear of V3. The driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with the passenger about the wedding and thinking about his business. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he rarely drives this vehicle and travels over this road only rarely. These factors contribute to the driver's lack of familiarity with the vehicle and the road, which may have affected their ability to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and lack of familiarity with the vehicle and road.
