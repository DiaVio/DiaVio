The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 16-year-old male, failed to maintain control of the vehicle by using the emergency brake instead of the normal brakes available to him. This driver had only been driving for a short period of time, which may have contributed to his poor directional control and inability to handle the situation properly.
