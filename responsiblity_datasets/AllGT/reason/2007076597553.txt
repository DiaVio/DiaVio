The reason for this is that V2 made a false assumption about the actions of V1 (the driver of the Ford Excursion). V2 assumed that V1 was slowing down and would stop prior to the intersection, which led to V2 entering the intersection and subsequently being struck by V1. Although V1 also had an associated factor in the crash, which was a failure to look to the side ahead as he approached the intersection, the critical reason for the crash was V2's false assumption of V1's actions.
