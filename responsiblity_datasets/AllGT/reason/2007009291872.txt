The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed (108 kmph or 67 mph) in lane four, which was too fast for the conditions of the road. - The driver failed to maintain control of the trailer after it started swaying due to a gust of wind caused by another vehicle passing. - The driver's attempts to regain control of the trailer by braking gently and steering in the opposite direction of the sway were unsuccessful. - The trailer jackknifed to the right side of V1, causing V1 to rotate and collide with the guardrail. - The trailer continued to rotate and dragged the truck back onto the road, resulting in a jackknife against the left side of V1. - The driver was cited by the police for failing to remain in lane, exceeding the speed limit, failing to give full time and attention, and inadequate trailer coupling. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed, failure to maintain control of the trailer, and inadequate response to the swaying caused by the passing vehicle.
