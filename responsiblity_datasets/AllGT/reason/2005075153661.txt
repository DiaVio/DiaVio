The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was distracted and accidentally shifted the gear into reverse while reaching for food. This caused the rear wheels to lock up and the vehicle to skid, ultimately leading to it rolling over and coming to rest on its left side. The driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle directly contributed to the crash.
