The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 struck the rear of the towed unit of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 was following too closely or failed to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, there is no mention of any contributing factors from Vehicle 2, such as improper parking or obstructing the roadway. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 1.
