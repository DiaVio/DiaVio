The reason for this is that V1 traveled over the double yellow line into opposing traffic, resulting in a collision with V2 (the driver of the 2001 Ford Taurus). Additionally, the police report indicates that V1 left the scene of the accident, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility. Furthermore, the driver of V1 admitted to taking several prescription medications, including a narcotic pain reliever and a muscle relaxant. This suggests that the driver of V1 may have been impaired or affected by the medications, leading to confusion, lethargy, and unsteadiness on his feet. Overall, V1's actions of crossing into opposing traffic and leaving the scene, combined with the potential impairment from prescription medications, make them primarily responsible for the crash.
