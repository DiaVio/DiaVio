The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to drifting over the right lane line and striking the left-rear portion of V2 with the front-right portion of V1. The driver stated that he suddenly felt very tired and was about to pull over before blacking out. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane" and the critical reason was "Sleeping, that is, actually asleep." Additionally, it was suspected that the driver and his passenger got very little sleep in the 24 hours leading up to the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2007 International tractor-trailer) was traveling in the northbound lane 1 at a speed of 64 kmph (40 mph) and did not track V1 behind him nor knew of its approach prior to the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was "Other motor vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over the left lane." However, the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver falling asleep and drifting into the adjacent lane.
