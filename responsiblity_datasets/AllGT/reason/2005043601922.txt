The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an illegal turn when entering the intersection. V1 was traveling east on an exit ramp and attempted to make a left turn (north) from a right-turn only lane, which was prohibited. This illegal maneuver put V1 in the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), causing the collision. Additionally, V1's driver admitted to not knowing that turning left from that lane was prohibited and assumed that the northbound traffic had a red light and would stop. This assumption was incorrect and led to the collision. Therefore, V1's illegal turn and failure to yield the right of way to V2 make them primarily responsible for the accident.
