The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the left westbound through lane and entered the intersection at the same time as Vehicle two (V2 - the 2007 Chevrolet transit bus). The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique, head-on manner, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. This failure to yield resulted in the collision and subsequent rotation of V1, causing it to strike the right side of V2 in a sideslap configuration. Additionally, the fact that V1's driver and right-front passenger were both using seat belts and their respective airbags deployed suggests that V1 was the vehicle that initiated the impact and was therefore primarily responsible for the accident.
