The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stay in its lane while turning left, causing it to depart the roadway. - V1 overcorrected after hitting the median curb, inducing a clockwise rotation. - V1 then departed the road again as its left tires struck the south curb. - V1 subsequently rolled and came to rest on its side. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle while making the left turn. The driver's statement about hitting the right curb and overcorrecting further supports the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
