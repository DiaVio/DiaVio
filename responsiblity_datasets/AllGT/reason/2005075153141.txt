The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane." This indicates that V2 was attempting to change lanes from lane two to lane one when its right side contacted V1. This action caused the initial impact and subsequent chain of events leading to the crash.
