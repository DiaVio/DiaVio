The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver changed lanes into the first lane on a slick surface, resulting in a loss of traction and subsequent loss of control. The driver's statement about trying to get clear of a car in the third lane indicates that the decision to change lanes was made by the driver, and it was this action that led to the accident. Additionally, the critical precrash event and reason coded for V1 indicate that the loss of control was due to poor road conditions, specifically slick roads caused by snow and slush. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision to change lanes on a slick surface, resulting in a loss of control.
