The reason for this is that V1 departed the right side of the road, struck a small tree, and then hit a utility pole. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, which was caused by an internal distraction. The driver of V1 was reaching for something when he crashed his vehicle, indicating a lack of attention and focus on the road. Additionally, driver inexperience was coded as an associated factor due to the driver's age. Since there is no information provided about V2 or any other contributing factors, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the crash.
