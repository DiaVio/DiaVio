The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 lost control and began to slide on the wet pavement, resulting in a clockwise rotation and entering the outboard lane, where it collided with the left front side of Vehicle 1. This initial impact caused both vehicles to veer off the road and collide with the guardrail. The actions of Vehicle 2 initiated the chain of events that led to the subsequent rollover and damage to both vehicles.
