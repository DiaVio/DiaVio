The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it departed the roadway, impacting a sign post and a small tree before sliding laterally and initiating a rollover. V1 then continued to slide on its right side, impacting shrubbery and a small tree before ultimately colliding with a large tree. This sequence of events suggests that V1 lost control and veered off the road, leading to the subsequent collisions and rollover.
