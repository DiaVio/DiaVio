The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling at an extremely slow speed of 3 mph while cleaning the street, creating a dust cloud that caused low visibility for traffic around it. The driver of Vehicle 1 reported that they were looking at the road they were cleaning and the traffic ahead of them, but they did not see Vehicle 2 before the impact. This indicates a failure to adequately surveil the road and be aware of other vehicles in their vicinity. Additionally, the witness at the scene confirmed that the street sweeper created a significant dust storm, further obstructing visibility for other drivers. While it is unclear whether Vehicle 2 attempted to pass Vehicle 1, the fact that the dust cloud was so large suggests that Vehicle 1's actions contributed to the hazardous conditions on the road. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a reasonable speed and create a safe environment for other drivers on the road.
