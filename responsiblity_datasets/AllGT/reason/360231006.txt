The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center median and traveled into the westbound lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 3 (V3) and subsequently impacting the front of Vehicle 1 (V1). This action by V2 caused V1 to be forced backwards and rotate counterclockwise, ultimately leading to the severe front-end collision.
