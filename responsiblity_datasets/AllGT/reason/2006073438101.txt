The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one was distracted by reaching for her cell phone in her purse while driving. This distraction caused her to take her attention off the roadway, resulting in her failure to notice that vehicle two was decelerating due to traffic congestion. As a result, vehicle one collided with the rear of vehicle two. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of vehicle one was following too closely to be able to react to the other vehicle. This indicates that the driver of vehicle one was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which further contributes to her responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, the driver of vehicle two was driving within the flow of traffic and decelerated appropriately when traffic began to slow down. Therefore, vehicle two cannot be considered primarily responsible for the accident.
