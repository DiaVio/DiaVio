The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 (the 1999 Dodge Neon) while attempting to make a left turn. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the investigation revealed that both vehicles had solid green lights, indicating that Vehicle #2 had the right of way while traveling straight through the intersection. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic led to the accident. It is worth noting that Vehicle #1's driver had health conditions and was on prescription medications, which may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance and decision-making in this case. However, the primary responsibility for the accident still lies with Vehicle #1 due to the failure to yield.
