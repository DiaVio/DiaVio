The reason for this is that V1 experienced a sudden blowout of the left rear tire, which caused the vehicle to veer to the right and make contact with V2 (the GMC Envoy). V1's driver stated that he attempted to steer his truck to the left onto the emergency shoulder, but the vehicle did not respond to the steering inputs. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle after the tire blowout. V2, on the other hand, was driving behind V1 and took evasive action by changing lanes to the right in order to avoid the disabled vehicle. However, V1 drifted into V2's travel lane and the two vehicles collided. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the tire blowout and subsequent loss of control, which led to the collision with V2.
