The reason for this is that V1 drifted left across the center lane line, causing it to collide with V2 (the 2013 Volvo Medium Heavy truck towing a trailer) traveling in the opposite direction. V2's driver attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and braking, indicating that V2 was not at fault. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for crossing into the oncoming lane and causing the collision.
