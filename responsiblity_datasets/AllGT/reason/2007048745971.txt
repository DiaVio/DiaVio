The reason for this is that the driver of V1 "did not see that traffic had stopped until it was too late." This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver, suggesting that they were not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead. Additionally, the vehicle damage indicates that the driver of V1 attempted to steer right in an effort to avoid the crash, further suggesting that they were not fully aware of the situation unfolding in front of them. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2001 Toyota Sequoia) stated that they saw V1 in their rearview mirror but were unable to avoid the crash due to traffic in front of them. This suggests that the driver of V2 was aware of the situation and attempted to take evasive action, but was hindered by the circumstances. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to recognize the stopped traffic ahead and take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
