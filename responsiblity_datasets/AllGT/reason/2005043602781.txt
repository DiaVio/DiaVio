The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection intending to make a u-turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. V1 stated that she was looking left out her driver side window when she was struck by V2 (the driver of the Ford F-150). This indicates that V1 failed to ensure that the intersection was clear before making the u-turn, resulting in the collision.
