The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 drifted right and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver reported having no explanation for what happened or how she ended up driving off the roadway. Additionally, associated factors coded to V1 include insufficient tire tread on both front tires and a failing transmission, which could have contributed to the driver's loss of control. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol content of .116 one hour and twenty minutes after the crash, indicating intoxication. The presence of marijuana was also detected. These substances impair judgment, coordination, and reaction time, making it more likely for the driver to make errors and lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving an unfamiliar vehicle that wasn't functioning properly, which could have further contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control. The driver also reported being late for work and experiencing internal distractions related to a terminally ill family member, which may have affected her focus and attention on the road. Overall, the combination of drifting off the roadway, insufficient tire tread, a failing transmission, intoxication, the presence of marijuana, driving an unfamiliar vehicle, being late for work, and internal distractions all point to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
