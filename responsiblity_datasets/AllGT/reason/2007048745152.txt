The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle that encroached into the path of V1, resulting in the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 declined to complete an interview and stated that he never saw V1 prior to the crash. This suggests a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V2, further supporting their responsibility for the accident.
