The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle after the right rear tire blew out. This indicates a failure in vehicle maintenance or inspection, as the blowout could have been prevented with proper tire maintenance. Additionally, the driver's medical condition and medication use may have contributed to impaired driving ability, although this information is not conclusive due to the inability to interview the driver. Overall, V1's responsibility lies in the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle after the tire blowout and the potential influence of the driver's medical condition and medication use.
