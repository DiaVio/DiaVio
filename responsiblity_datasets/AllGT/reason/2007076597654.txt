The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it traveled off the right side of the road, struck several large boulders, and ultimately rolled over. The driver of V1, who was well-rested and familiar with her vehicle, stated that she did not remember anything about the crash. Additionally, a witness mentioned that V1 just "drifted off the right side of the road." The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: unknown critical non-performance. It is suggested that this may have been due to the medications the driver takes, which include Oxycontin and Xanax.
