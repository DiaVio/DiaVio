The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed all westbound lanes, impacted a pole, and rolled over. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: off the edge of the road on the right side." Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "driver related factor: unknown critical non-performance." Although the driver of Vehicle 2 (1999 Chrysler Concorde) stated that he saw Vehicle 1 swerve, hit the post, and roll over but was unable to avoid it, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 as it was the vehicle that departed the lanes and caused the initial impact with the pole.
