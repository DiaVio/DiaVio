The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 80 kmph (50 mph), which was 16 kmph (10 mph) above the posted speed limit. The driver was also distracted, although the specific distraction is unknown. The driver of V1 applied the brakes with lock-up before impact, indicating that they realized V2 was decelerating but were unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. The pre-impact skid marks of V1 also suggest that the ABS brakes did not activate. These factors, along with the aggressive driving due to speeding, insufficient evasive actions, and inadequate surveillance, contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
