The reason for this is that V2 admitted to entering the intersection without checking the color of the traffic signal or if the traffic was clear. This indicates a failure to yield the right of way and a disregard for traffic laws. Additionally, V2 was following the bus without being familiar with the area, which could have contributed to a lack of awareness and poor decision-making. On the other hand, V1 (the driver of the Camero) was driving at a constant speed and had the right of way as the traffic signal was green. V1 stated that they did not slow down because they believed the bus would have cleared the intersection by the time they reached it. Overall, V2's failure to yield and failure to stop for a traffic signal, along with their unfamiliarity with the roadway, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
