The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. V2 stopped midway in the road but could not avoid the collision with V1, which was traveling southbound. V2's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
