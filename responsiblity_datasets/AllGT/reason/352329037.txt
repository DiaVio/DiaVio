The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted left and across the northbound travel lane, ultimately departing the roadway and colliding with Vehicle 2 (the unoccupied 2005 Toyota 4Runner). This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and veered into the oncoming lane, resulting in the collision.
