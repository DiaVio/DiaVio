The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 72-80 kmph (45-50 mph) on an icy roadway during snowy conditions. Despite the driver's attempt to control the vehicle by applying brakes and steering left, V1 continued to slide and rotate clockwise, eventually departing the right road edge and colliding with the embankment. The driver's failure to adjust their speed to the road conditions and maintain control of the vehicle on the icy roadway contributed to the crash.
