The driver of V1 admitted to being emotionally troubled and suffering from a migraine headache at the time of the crash. She also stated that she blacked out while reaching for her asthma inhaler, which impaired her ability to act. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not in a suitable condition to operate the vehicle safely. Additionally, the driver was not wearing a seatbelt and was ejected from the vehicle during the roll event, further contributing to the severity of her injuries. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired physical and mental state, as well as the failure to wear a seatbelt.
