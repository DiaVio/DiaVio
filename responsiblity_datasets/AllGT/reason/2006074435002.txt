The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by an external factor while driving, which was coded as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. This distraction likely caused V1 to fail to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's statement about scanning left, right, and forward for her appointment suggests that her attention was not fully focused on the road and the intersection. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Caravan) was not found to have any critical reason or factor that contributed to the collision. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
