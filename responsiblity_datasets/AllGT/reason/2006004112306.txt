The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn into the private driveway. Despite slowing down and looking to see if the road was clear, the driver did not notice V2 approaching from the opposite direction. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed that they did not believe V2 had its headlights on, which they believed would have allowed them to see the vehicle coming and avoid the turn. However, the police investigation determined that V2's lights were on and operational. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to their failure to properly assess the intersection and their incorrect assumption about the status of V2's headlights.
