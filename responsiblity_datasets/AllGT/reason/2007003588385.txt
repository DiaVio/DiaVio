The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event and associated factors. The driver was tailgating and did not realize that he was too close to the forward vehicle (V2). This aggressive driving behavior and lack of awareness led to the collision when V1 rear-ended V2.
