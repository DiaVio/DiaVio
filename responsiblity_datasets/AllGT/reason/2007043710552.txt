The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was following too closely to V2 and failed to leave enough gap distance to slow down when he realized there was a danger ahead. Additionally, V1 was driving too fast for the heavy traffic conditions, which were further exacerbated by the morning rush hour congestion. These factors, along with the driver's decision to take his eyes off the road to check his right side mirror, led to V1's failure to respond to V2's sudden braking and subsequent collision with V2's vehicle.
