The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not realize that traffic was stopped ahead. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." As a result, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2, causing damage to V2 and necessitating its towing. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and react in a timely manner makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
