The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to traveling too fast to stop when he saw V2 crossing the intersection. This indicates that V1 was not driving at a safe speed and was unable to avoid the collision even though he attempted to brake. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was also coded as "driver related factor; aggressive driving behavior," further supporting V1's responsibility for the accident.
