The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that V2 (the driver of the Volkswagen Jetta) had stopped in front of them. V1 admits to not being distracted or focused on anything other than driving, but claims to have failed to notice the stopped vehicle for "some unknown reason." Additionally, V1 remembers driving behind V2 but cannot recall if V2 had its turn signal on, indicating a lack of attention to the road ahead. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane stopped," and the Critical Reason was coded as "inattention (daydreaming), thought focus unknown." This suggests that V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and failed to look far enough ahead, leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inattention and failure to notice the stopped vehicle in front of them.
