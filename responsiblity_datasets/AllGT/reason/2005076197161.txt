The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel after driving for 1 1/2 hours. This indicates that the driver was fatigued and not fully alert while operating the vehicle. Falling asleep at the wheel is a clear violation of safe driving practices and is a major contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 113 kmph, which exceeds the posted speed limit of 104 kph. This indicates that the driver was also exceeding the speed limit, further increasing the risk of losing control of the vehicle. The combination of the driver's fatigue and excessive speed likely caused V1 to gradually depart the road and ultimately crash into the mesquite bush. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
