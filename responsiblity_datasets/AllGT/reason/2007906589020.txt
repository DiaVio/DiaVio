The reason for this is that V1 attempted to enter lane two from lane one without maintaining proper control of their vehicle. This is indicated by the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1, which states that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. Additionally, V1's vehicle made contact with the rear of V2's vehicle, indicating that V1 was the one merging into V2's lane. Furthermore, the lack of cooperation from V1, who refused to comment and could not be reached by telephone, makes it difficult to determine any other contributing factors or reasons for the crash. However, the fact that V1 was using a prescription medication often used to treat anxiety may be a potential factor to consider. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control of their vehicle while attempting to merge into another lane.
