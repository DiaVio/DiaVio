The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the Ford Ranger pickup). V1's inadequate surveillance, which was influenced by the driver's distraction from talking on a cell phone, led to the collision.
