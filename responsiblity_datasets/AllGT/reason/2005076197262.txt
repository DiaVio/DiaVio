The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, which impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, he was traveling over the posted speed limit and was distracted by conversing with the passenger. These factors, combined with his overcompensation when trying to avoid an animal on the roadway, led to the vehicle losing control and ultimately rolling over.
