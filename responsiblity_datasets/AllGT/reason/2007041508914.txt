The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a blown left front tire. This tire failure caused V1 to veer off the roadway, resulting in a chain of collisions with a fence, a parked SUV, and finally a house. The driver's limited experience with the vehicle and infrequent driving on that particular roadway may have contributed to the accident. Additionally, the tires on V1 had very low tread depth, which could have further compromised their performance and stability.
