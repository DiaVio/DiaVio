The reason for this is that V2 departed its lane to the left and fully entered the westbound travel lane, causing a collision with V1. V1, the 2005 Toyota Corolla sedan, was already negotiating a curve to the right and was unable to avoid the collision despite the driver's attempt to brake and steer right. Therefore, V2's departure from its lane and entry into the westbound lane is the primary cause of the accident.
