The driver of Vehicle 1 was distracted, although the specific distraction is unknown. This distraction likely caused the driver to fail to recognize that Vehicle 2 was stopped in front of them, leading to the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 1 skidded 3.7 meters (12 feet) after applying the brakes, indicating that the driver may have been traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them.
