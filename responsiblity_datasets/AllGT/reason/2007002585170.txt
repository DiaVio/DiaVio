The reason for this is that the driver of V1 approached the curve too fast, went off the right side of the roadway, overcorrected to the left, and ultimately lost control of the vehicle. The witness also stated that the driver had approached the curve too fast and had been involved in previous crashes in the same spot. Additionally, the police indicated that speed was a contributing factor. Therefore, the driver's actions of traveling too fast for the conditions and overcompensating for the initial mistake led to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
