The reason for V1's responsibility is that the right rear wheel came off the vehicle, causing it to lose control and veer into the left lane, ultimately leaving the roadway and rolling over. This was due to a vehicle-related factor, specifically the failure of the tires/wheels caused by lug nut separation. The driver's limited experience with V1, having purchased it just a week prior to the crash and having driven it only 10 times, may have also contributed to the inability to handle the situation effectively. Additionally, the driver's lack of familiarity with the road where the crash occurred could have played a role in the accident.
