The reason for this is that V1 was leaving a driveway and turning left onto the roadway. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver failed to adequately look or failed to see the oncoming vehicle (V2) before entering the roadway. This suggests that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Crown Victoria) attempted to avoid the crash by steering left and applying the brakes. This indicates that V2 was aware of V1 entering the roadway and made an effort to prevent the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic.
