The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver of Vehicle 1 was not restrained, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. Additionally, the road conditions were wet with areas of ice and slush, indicating that the driver may have been traveling too fast for the conditions, leading to the loss of control.
