The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before attempting to cross the northbound lanes. Despite claiming to have looked both ways, she did not see V2 (the 1998 Ford Escort ZX2) approaching in the northbound lane. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make her primarily responsible for the accident.
