The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was attributed to vehicle one as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of vehicle one failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making a left turn at the intersection, leading to the collision with vehicle two. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of vehicle one stated that she just followed the car in front of her when the light turned yellow, indicating a lack of proper judgment and decision-making in the situation. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn.
