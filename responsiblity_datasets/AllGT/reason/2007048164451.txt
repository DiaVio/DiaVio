The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding into it. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 did not properly observe the intersection and failed to notice V1 approaching. As a result, V2 entered the intersection and collided with the left side of V1.
