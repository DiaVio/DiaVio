The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn. The driver stated that she looked to her left and then to her right, but did not see V2 approaching from her left. She failed to look back to the left before entering the intersection, which resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 had been stopped for more than 10 seconds (5 minutes) before making the left turn, indicating that the driver had ample time to observe the traffic and ensure it was safe to proceed. However, the driver's failure to properly survey the intersection and detect V2 approaching from her left led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance.
