The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) on a curved entrance ramp with a recommended speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). The driver's excessive speed for the curve, combined with factors such as fatigue, aggressive driving, and being in a hurry, contributed to the loss of control and subsequent rollover of V1.
