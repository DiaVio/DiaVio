The reason for this is that V1 had a large inflatable flotation device in the front right seat, which completely obstructed the driver's view out of the right side glazing and the right side mirror. This obstruction contributed to the driver's inability to see V2 (the other vehicle) as it entered the intersection. Additionally, V1's driver was noted in the driver history of the medical records as being fidgety at church that morning, indicating a potential lack of focus or attention while driving. Therefore, V1's view obstruction and potential driver error make them primarily responsible for the accident.
