The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by the motorcycle police officer parked on the sidewalk, which caused her to not notice that V2 had stopped in front of her. This distraction led to V1 failing to maintain a safe distance and subsequently colliding with the back of V2.
