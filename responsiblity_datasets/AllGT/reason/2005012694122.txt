The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to come to a full stop at the stop sign and proceeded to cross the intersection. This is considered an illegal maneuver and a recognition error, as the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 performed a rolling stop, indicating a lack of compliance with traffic regulations. While V2 had the right of way and was traveling straight through the intersection, V1's failure to stop and yield resulted in the collision. Although V2's driver was engaged in a conversation and did not have a license, insurance, registration, or proper child safety seats, these factors do not absolve V1 of their responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding.
