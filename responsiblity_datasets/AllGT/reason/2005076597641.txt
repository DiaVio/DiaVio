The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically during heavy rain on a wet roadway. The driver was going 72 kmph (45 mph) in a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph) advisory speed limit. Additionally, the driver was relatively inexperienced and unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to the loss of control. The hydroplaning of the vehicle during the right-hand curve further indicates that the driver was not adjusting their speed appropriately for the wet conditions.
