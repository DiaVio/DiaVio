The reason for this is that V1's driver drove off the right side of the road, struck a guardrail, and then went down an embankment, ultimately colliding with a tree and brush. The driver's medical report indicated that he had several pre-existing medical conditions, including diabetes, hepatitis C, sleep apnea, heart problems, and an injured Achilles tendon. He was also taking nineteen separate drugs, including several narcotics. The police reconstruction team and NASS researchers believe that the driver most likely had a medical/drug-related issue that caused him to run off the road. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a "heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act," indicating that the driver may have passed out at the wheel due to drug interactions and relinquished control of his vehicle. Additionally, the driver was issued citations for failure to maintain lane, no driver's license, no seatbelt, and no insurance.
