The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not see V2 (the Chevrolet Suburban) slowing down for traffic. This is evident from the fact that V1's critical reason for the critical event was coded as "inadequate surveillance." V1 was looking in his rearview mirror for vehicles behind him and only noticed V2 just prior to the impact. Additionally, V1's lack of familiarity with the roadway and the vehicle he was driving may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation and react in a timely manner. It is important to note that V2's critical reason for the critical event was not coded, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the collision.
