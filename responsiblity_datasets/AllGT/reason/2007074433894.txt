The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle entering the interstate. Additionally, the driver overreacted by steering left and braking, which caused V1 to lose control and collide with the concrete median jersey barrier. The slick roadway conditions due to mild frost may have also contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
