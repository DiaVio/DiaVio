The driver of V1 took his eyes off the road to look at two dogs being walked on the east shoulder, which caused him to not notice that V2 (2004 Chevrolet Malibu Classic) had slowed down to make a left turn into a driveway. As a result, V1 struck the rear of V2. The driver of V1 was distracted by an external factor, which led to the collision.
