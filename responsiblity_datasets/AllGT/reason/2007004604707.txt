The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to running a red light and entering the intersection without observing the traffic signal. Additionally, the driver stated that she was traveling at a high rate of speed and decided to "go for it" because she believed the road was too wet to stop. These actions demonstrate a clear violation of traffic laws and a failure to exercise proper caution while driving.
