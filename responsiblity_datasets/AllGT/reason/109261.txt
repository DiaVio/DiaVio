The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 reportedly confused the gas and brake pedals, causing the vehicle to accelerate instead of braking. This resulted in V1 departing the right side of the exit ramp and colliding with various objects, including a tree and a well head/pump. The driver's confusion and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle led to the accident.
