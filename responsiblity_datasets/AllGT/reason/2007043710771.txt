The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. Despite noticing that the ground was wet, the driver did not anticipate the presence of ice on the roadway. This false assumption led to the loss of control of the vehicle and subsequent collision with the curb and guide wire. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer and brake was ineffective due to the low friction road surface caused by the ice.
