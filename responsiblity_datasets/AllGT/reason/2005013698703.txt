The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding to turn left. They stated that they looked both ways but did not see any vehicles coming. However, they failed to notice the presence of V2 (the 1989 Oldsmobile Delta 88) traveling eastbound in lane two. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1 led to the collision. Additionally, V1 proceeded into the roadway with an obstructed view due to a truck in the right lane. This further contributed to the driver's inability to see V2 approaching. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the intersection and proceed with caution, along with the obstructed view, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
