The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and inattentive (daydreaming) while driving. This is evident from the driver's statement that he was thinking about the auction and concerned about losing money on his truck consignments. As a result of his inattention, he attempted to pass V2 and then abruptly moved back into lane four when he realized another vehicle was already in lane five. This sudden maneuver, combined with his failure to maintain a safe following distance, led to the collision with the back of V2. While V2 was slowing down due to traffic, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was not coded, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident.
