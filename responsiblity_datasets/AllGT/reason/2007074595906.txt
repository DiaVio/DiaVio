The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection." Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; false assumption of other's actions." This indicates that the driver of V2 assumed that V1 would stop, leading to the collision.
