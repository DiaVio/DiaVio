The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a diabetic blackout, causing him to pass out at the wheel and lose control of the car. This resulted in V1 crossing the double yellow lines and colliding with V2 (the 2004 Honda Accord). The driver's low blood sugar level, as indicated by medical records, supports the claim of a blackout. Additionally, V1 came to a final rest off the south side of the roadway, indicating that the loss of control was due to the driver's condition. On the other hand, V2's driver was not found to have contributed to the crash. She was traveling within the speed limit, had no health-related problems, and was wearing corrective lenses for her myopic condition. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was the encroachment of V1 into the opposite lane, which was beyond her control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's diabetic blackout and subsequent loss of control.
