The reason for this is that V1 was backing up onto the roadway without adequate surveillance. The driver stated that they did not see V2 until they passed the dumpster shed and were already in the roadway. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of other vehicles on the road. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was an environmental factor: view obstructed by roadway design/furniture. This suggests that the driver of V1 did not take into account the potential obstruction caused by the wooden shed housing the dumpster, which further contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the roadway and the obstructed view caused by the shed are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the accident.
