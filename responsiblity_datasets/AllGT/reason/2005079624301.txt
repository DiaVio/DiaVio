The driver of V1 was making a left turn from the northbound direction, and the critical reason for the collision was determined to be "inadequate surveillance" on the part of the V1 driver. This means that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, the sight line for V1 was hindered, which further contributed to the driver's inability to adequately survey the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
