The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver, an eighty-four-year-old male, dozed off while driving. This resulted in V1 departing the right road edge and subsequently colliding with the guardrails on both sides of the road. The driver's admission of falling asleep, combined with his age and medical conditions (heart condition, hypertension, and taking prescription medications), suggests that his drowsiness and lack of attentiveness were the main contributing factors to the crash.
