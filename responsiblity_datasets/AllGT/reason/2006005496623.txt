The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass the Non-contact Vehicle on the right by entering the paved shoulder, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, V1's right front tire struck the north curb, causing the vehicle to veer back into the travel lane and collide with V2. This illegal maneuver by V1 directly led to the accident.
