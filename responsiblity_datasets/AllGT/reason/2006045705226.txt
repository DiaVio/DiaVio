The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The road was wet, it was dark and unlit, and there was light mist type rain. Additionally, the road had a negative precrash grade, which could have contributed to the loss of traction. The driver's failure to adjust their speed to the road and weather conditions led to the loss of control, departure from the road, and subsequent collision with the stone mailbox.
