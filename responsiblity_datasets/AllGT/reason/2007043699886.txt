The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed of 89 kmph (exceeding the posted speed limit of 72 kmph) in wet and rainy conditions, which can reduce traction and increase the risk of losing control. - V1 negotiated a left curve but failed to maintain control and traveled off the right roadside. - The driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol level of .246 and tested positive for cocaine, indicating impaired driving. - The driver's inability to accurately recount the events of the crash and the location of the wreck suggests a lack of awareness and focus while driving. - The driver's history of panic attacks and the use of multiple prescription medications may have contributed to impaired judgment and reaction time. Overall, V1's excessive speed, failure to maintain control, and the driver's impaired state due to alcohol and drugs make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
