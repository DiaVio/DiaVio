The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling east on the roadway and failed to negotiate the curve, causing the vehicle to go off the roadway to the right. This indicates a driver-related factor, as the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve. Additionally, the fact that the driver left the scene of the accident and was observed taking items from the vehicle raises concerns about their condition and potential impairment. Without further information, such as the driver's blood alcohol content or any evidence of speeding, it cannot be definitively determined if alcohol or excessive speed were contributing factors. However, the driver's known history of speeding and consuming alcoholic beverages, as reported by a friend, suggests that these factors may have played a role in the driver's inability to negotiate the curve. Overall, the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and their unknown critical non-performance are the primary reasons for the crash, making Vehicle #1 primarily responsible.
