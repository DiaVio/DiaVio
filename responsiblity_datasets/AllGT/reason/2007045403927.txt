The reason for V1's responsibility is that the left rear wheel fell off, causing the vehicle to veer to the left and ultimately collide with the concrete barrier. The driver reported feeling a bump and hitting the brakes, but it is unclear why the wheel fell off. However, it is mentioned that the vehicle had oversized, over-inflated tires and heavy custom wheels, which could have contributed to the tire/wheel failure.
