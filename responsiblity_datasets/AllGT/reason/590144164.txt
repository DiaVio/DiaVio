The reason for this is that the driver failed to navigate the exit ramp properly and instead continued across the intersection and onto the interstate entrance ramp. Additionally, the driver steered the vehicle hard to the left for unknown reasons, causing it to leave the entrance ramp and slide onto the gravel shoulder. The driver then attempted to regain the roadway by steering hard to the right, resulting in the vehicle entering into a clockwise yaw and ultimately colliding with the back of a stopped tractor-trailer. These actions indicate a failure on the part of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle and make appropriate decisions while driving, leading to the accident.
