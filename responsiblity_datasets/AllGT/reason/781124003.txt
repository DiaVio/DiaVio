The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to use the available lap and shoulder belt restraint, as evidenced by physical evidence. This failure to use the seatbelt contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries. Additionally, V1 was intending to make a left turn at the intersection, but failed to yield the right of way to the oncoming Vehicle 2 (V2). V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering left, but was unable to completely avoid the impact with V1. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to use the seatbelt and their failure to yield the right of way.
