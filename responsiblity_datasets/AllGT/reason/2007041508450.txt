The driver of V1 made a left turn across the path of V2 without properly checking for oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 admitted to not looking over his left shoulder before making the turn and never saw V2 coming. This indicates a driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway and was lost, which may have contributed to the driver's lack of awareness of the other southbound travel lane on the other side of the median. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
