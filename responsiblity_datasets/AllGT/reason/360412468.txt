The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a medical condition/illness, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and depart from the roadway. This medical condition/illness is considered to be the primary cause of the accident, as it directly led to V1 striking a large boulder and ultimately coming to a rest off the roadway.
