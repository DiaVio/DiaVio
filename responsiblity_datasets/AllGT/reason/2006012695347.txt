The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver's reported speed of 34-48kmph (21-30mph) was above the posted speed limit of 40kmph (25mph), indicating that he was exceeding the legal speed limit. Additionally, the driver did not apply sufficient braking inputs, as indicated by the EDR (Event Data Recorder) data, which further contributed to the inability to avoid the crash. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience, having only been driving for two years, could have played a role in his inability to react appropriately to the situation. Overall, V1's excessive speed, lack of braking, and inexperience make the driver primarily responsible for the crash.
