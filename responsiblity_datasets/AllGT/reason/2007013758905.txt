The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 17-year-old female, stated that she was traveling at approximately 96Kmph (60Mph) on a gravel rural roadway with a posted speed limit of 89Kmph (55Mph). This indicates that she was traveling too fast for the conditions of the road, which resulted in a loss of control when she crested a small hill. The driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle before it departed the roadway and rolled over further supports the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the crash.
