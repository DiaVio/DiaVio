The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of heavy medication, which caused her to fall asleep or become unconscious while driving. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, which states that the driver was on heavy medication and fell asleep or became unconscious. Additionally, the driver herself stated that she was just driving and did not remember driving off the road. Therefore, the driver's impaired state due to medication is the main factor that led to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
