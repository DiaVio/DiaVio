The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver of V2 stated that she looked to the right and left before entering the intersection but did not see V1 until the last second. This indicates a failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic, leading to the collision with V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." While V1's assumption that V2 would yield the right-of-way was an associated factor in the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V2 due to the driver's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle.
