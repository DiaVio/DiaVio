The driver of V1 was making a left turn against the light at the intersection from a lane that is not designated as a turning lane. This illegal maneuver is considered a decision error and is the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event of V1. The driver of V1 also had associated factors such as conversation with the passenger and inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their illegal left turn against the light and the associated factors that contributed to the decision error.
