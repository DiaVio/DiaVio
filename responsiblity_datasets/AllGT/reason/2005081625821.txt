The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. V2 struck the right side rear of V1 as it crossed its path, indicating that V2 did not properly observe and react to the presence of V1.
