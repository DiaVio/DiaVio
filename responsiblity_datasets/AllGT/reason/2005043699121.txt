The reason for Vehicle 1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by looking down at the center console while trying to place a soda in the cup holder. This distraction caused the vehicle to veer off the left side of the road, and although the driver attempted to correct the vehicle's path, she overcorrected and lost control, ultimately colliding with the guardrail. Additionally, the driver was cited for a lane use infraction, indicating that she failed to maintain proper control of her vehicle within her designated lane. Furthermore, she was also cited for a child seat violation, suggesting that she did not properly secure the 5-year-old passenger in the right front seat. Overall, the driver's distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle, along with the child seat violation, make Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the crash.
