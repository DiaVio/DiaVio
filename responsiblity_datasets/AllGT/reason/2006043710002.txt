The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit, and was intoxicated with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .174. The driver also tested positive for cocaine and cannabinoids. Additionally, the driver had been awake for approximately 20 hours prior to the crash, indicating severe fatigue. The driver's excessive speed, impaired state due to alcohol and drugs, and extreme fatigue contributed to the driver's inability to negotiate the left curve properly. The driver overcompensated when attempting to return to the roadway, resulting in the vehicle yawing counterclockwise and ultimately leaving the road. The driver's impaired judgment and physical condition significantly increased the risk of a crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance errors, including overcompensation, alcohol intoxication, drug use, and severe fatigue.
