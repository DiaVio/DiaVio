The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 2007 Kenworth concrete mixing truck) when entering the intersection. V1 stopped at the intersection intending to go straight, but failed to see the approaching truck and proceeded forward without sufficient clearance. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as internal distraction, indicating that the driver of V1 was distracted and failed to properly observe the intersection before entering. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their internal distraction.
