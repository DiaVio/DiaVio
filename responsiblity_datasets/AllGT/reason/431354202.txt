The reason for this is that V2 lost control and traveled off the south travel lane and onto the south shoulder. After regaining control, V2 crossed the double yellow line and entered the northbound travel lane, resulting in the collision with V1. The rotation of V2 after the initial impact further indicates that it was the vehicle that caused the crash.
