The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 drifted right and struck the west side curb edge, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. This was followed by the driver's unsuccessful attempt to steer left, resulting in Vehicle 1 departing the roadside edge and ultimately colliding with the concrete barrier wall. The driver's failure to negotiate the curve and maintain the intended path of travel demonstrates a lack of attentiveness and proper driving technique. Additionally, the fact that the driver was unbelted suggests a disregard for safety measures, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
