The reason for V1's responsibility is that the vehicle lost traction on black ice while negotiating the sharp right curve. This caused V1 to skid into the oncoming lane and collide with V2 (the 2007 Honda Accord). Although V1 was not traveling at an unsafe speed and the black ice was not visible, the driver should have exercised caution and adjusted their driving behavior to the road conditions. The loss of control due to poor road conditions ultimately led to the collision.
