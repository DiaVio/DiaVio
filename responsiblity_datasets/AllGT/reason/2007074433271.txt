The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway, struck shrubs and a tree, and then returned to the roadway before colliding with V2. The driver of V1 stated that he does not remember the crash, and there were suspicions of drug and alcohol use, although medical records indicate negative results for both tests. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor: unknown critical non-performance, as there were no indications of any avoidance actions or attempts to steer back towards the roadway. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2008 Ford Escape) was not involved in the first harmful event and did not have time to attempt any avoidance maneuvers. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the crash.
