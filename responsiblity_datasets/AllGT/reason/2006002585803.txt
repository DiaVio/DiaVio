The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a performance error of overcompensation. When the driver realized she was off the edge of the road, she overcorrected to the left, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and lose control. This overcompensation ultimately led to the vehicle striking a tree and coming to rest facing east. Additionally, the driver was internally distracted as she looked down at the shifter to check if she was in the correct gear. This distraction caused her to lose focus on the driving task and contributed to the driver's overcompensation error. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance error and internal distraction.
