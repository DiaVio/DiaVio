The driver admitted to being distracted by an unknown object inside the vehicle, which caused him to look away from the road. When he looked back, he realized that traffic was stopped in front of him, but it was too late to avoid a collision. The lack of pre-crash skid marks on the roadway suggests that V1 did not attempt to brake or slow down before the impact, indicating a failure to maintain a safe following distance and react in a timely manner to the traffic situation. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to pay attention to the road and traffic conditions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
