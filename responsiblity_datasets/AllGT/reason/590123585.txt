The reason for this is that the driver of V1, while intending to make a left turn, failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1972 Ford F250 pickup. V1 pulled into the intersection without giving V2 enough time or space to avoid the collision. This failure to yield resulted in the near side impact between V1 and the front of V2. Additionally, V1's rotation and mounting of the northwest corner, as well as striking down the Stop sign, suggest that V1 was not able to properly execute the left turn maneuver, further indicating the driver's responsibility for the accident.
