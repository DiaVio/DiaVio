The driver of V1 was test-driving the truck after completing repairs to the cruise-control device and was not familiar with the vehicle. He stated that he had been driving for almost one-half hour at the time of the crash and had been experiencing traffic slowing down and speeding up. However, he failed to maintain a safe distance and speed, resulting in him being unable to stop in time and skidding into the back of V2. Reason: V1 is primarily responsible because the driver was driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as a driver-related factor.
