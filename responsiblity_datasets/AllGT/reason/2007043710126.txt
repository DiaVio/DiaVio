The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite coming to a complete stop and waiting a few seconds, she did not see V2 (the 1998 Honda Accord) approaching from the opposite direction. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 turning left in front of V2, causing the collision. Additionally, V1's state of mind and rushing due to being late to pick up her son from school may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance. However, the primary responsibility lies with her failure to see V2 before making the left turn. It is important to note that V2's speed and the fact that his light changed from green to yellow do not absolve V1 of her responsibility. V2 had the right of way and was not encroaching on V1's lane.
