The reason for this is that V2 was making a U-turn, which is a risky maneuver, especially on a wet road. The driver of V2 admitted to being inattentive due to conversing with passengers and looking for the turn destination. Additionally, the driver had limited experience with the vehicle and the roadway, and failed to adequately surveil the surroundings before making the U-turn. These factors indicate that the driver of V2 was not exercising proper caution and failed to ensure a safe maneuver, resulting in the collision with V1.
