The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, across path." This suggests that Vehicle Two encroached into the path of Vehicle One, causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle Two admitted to looking right and then forward as she entered the intersection, indicating a failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic.
