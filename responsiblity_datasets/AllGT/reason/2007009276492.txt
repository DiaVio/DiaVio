The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to yield the right of way and began their U-turn as V2 entered the intersection. V1's inadequate surveillance is cited as the critical reason for the accident, as the driver stated that she looked but never saw V2 prior to impact. Additionally, V1's work-related stress was identified as an associated factor.
