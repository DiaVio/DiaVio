The reason for this is that V1 was traveling behind V2, the 2003 Thomas School bus, and failed to stop in time, resulting in a collision with the back of V2. V1 was braking at the time of the crash, indicating that the driver was aware of the need to stop, but was unable to do so in a timely manner. This suggests that V1 was following too closely or not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead, leading to the rear-end crash.
