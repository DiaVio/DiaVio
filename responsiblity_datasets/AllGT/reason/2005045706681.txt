The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way while attempting to make a left turn. Despite the non-contact vehicle stopping and waving Vehicle 1 out, it was still the responsibility of Vehicle 1 to ensure that it was safe to proceed. Vehicle 1 made a false assumption that the way was clear based on the non-contact driver's actions, without having a clear view of the oncoming traffic due to the sight restriction caused by the non-contact vehicle. This decision error and false assumption led to the collision with Vehicle 2. Vehicle 2 (the 1998 Ford Escort) also had a contributing factor of the non-contact vehicle sight restriction, as the driver of Vehicle 2 claimed that she did not see Vehicle 1 until it was past the non-contact vehicle. However, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 for failing to yield and making a left turn without a clear view of the oncoming traffic.
