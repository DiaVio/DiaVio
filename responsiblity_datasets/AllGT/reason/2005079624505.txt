The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by adjusting the radio while driving, which took her attention away from the driving task. As a result, she failed to notice V2 approaching from the opposite direction and made a left turn in front of V2, causing the collision. V2, on the other hand, attempted to avoid the collision by steering to the right without applying the brakes, indicating that she was not at fault for the accident.
