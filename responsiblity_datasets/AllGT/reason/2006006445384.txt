The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel, which caused V1 to drift and collide with the rear of V2 (the 1996 Nissan Sentra). This indicates a clear driver-related factor, as the driver was fatigued and exhausted. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a history of alcohol and drug abuse, and had been recovering from a week-long drinking binge. These factors likely contributed to the driver's impaired state and inability to safely operate the vehicle.
