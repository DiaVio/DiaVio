The critical precrash event for V1 was the loss of control due to a disabling vehicle failure, specifically the left front wheel coming off the vehicle. This resulted in the wheel bouncing over the center median jersey barrier and into the fifth lane of the northbound lanes, where it struck V2 (the 1994 Ford Thunderbird coupe) at the top center of the windshield. V2, on the other hand, was not assigned the critical reason for the collision. The driver of V2 was conversing with the right front passenger at the time of the collision, but no additional factors were noted for this driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the failure of its tires/wheels, which led to the wheel detachment and subsequent impact with V2.
