The reason for this is that the unknown vehicle changed lanes into lane one, forcing V1 to swerve right and lock up the brakes. This action by the unknown vehicle caused V1 to depart the roadway and impact a rockery wall, resulting in the crash. Since the unknown vehicle was not contacted and left the scene, they are considered responsible for the incident.
