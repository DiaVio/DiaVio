The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 (the 2006 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx) at a 90-degree angle, causing severe impact. The severity of the impact, as indicated by the observed vehicle damage and the calculated delta-v, suggests that V2 was the one that caused the collision. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the case occupant, such as the thoracic aortic rupture, lung contusions, rib fractures, and other fractures, indicate that the force of the impact came from the left side of the vehicle, which is consistent with V2 striking V1 at a 90-degree angle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 (the 2002 GMC Envoy) is primarily responsible for the accident.
