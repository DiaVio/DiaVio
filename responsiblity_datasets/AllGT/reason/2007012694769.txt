The driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by attempting to make a U-turn on the roadway, which is a decision error. This action caused V1 to collide with V2 (the 1970 Dodge Dart Swinger) on its left side, resulting in significant damage and injuries to both drivers. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by looking for the urgent care facility and was not familiar with the area. This lack of familiarity and distraction likely contributed to the driver's decision to make the illegal U-turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's illegal maneuver and decision error.
