The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of the Honda Accord sedan was distracted and not watching the road. She admitted to sorting through her purse with her right hand, which caused her to have a recognition error and fail to notice the parked car on the right side of the road. This distraction and failure to adequately surveil the road ahead led to the collision.
