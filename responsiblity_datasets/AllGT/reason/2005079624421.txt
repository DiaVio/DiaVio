The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was under the influence of a narcotic analgesic, a depressant, and a stimulant, which impaired their ability to maintain lane control of the vehicle. This is evident from the fact that V1 entered the parking lane and collided with V2, causing a chain reaction with the parked vehicle in front of it. The lack of pre-crash avoidance skid marks further indicates that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
