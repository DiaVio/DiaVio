The reason for this is that V1 lost traction and control of the vehicle, resulting in it skidding to the right and ultimately crashing into a tree. The investigation revealed that the vehicle's tires were bald, with zero tread depth on the front tires and minimal tread depth on the rear tires. This indicates that the tires were not suitable for driving on wet roads, which contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the driver admitted to being unfamiliar with the vehicle and rarely driving on the roadway. This lack of familiarity, combined with the wet road conditions, further contributed to the driver's inability to negotiate the curve safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the combination of driving with inadequate tires, lack of familiarity with the vehicle, and failure to adjust driving behavior to the wet road conditions.
