The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed exceeding the speed limit, which was further exacerbated by the wet road conditions due to the rain. The driver's excitement about his home loan and potential inattention to the driving task also contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver overcompensated when trying to avoid a dog on the road, which led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with various obstacles. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, inattention, and overcompensation while negotiating the curve and encountering the dog.
