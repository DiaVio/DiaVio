The driver of Vehicle one was distracted by a person playing basketball to his left and was also holding a drink in his right hand. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the sun was in his eyes due to the time of the crash and the slope of the road. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle one was not fully focused on the road and failed to maintain a safe distance from the stopped Vehicle two. While Vehicle two (1997 Plymouth Voyager) was stopped at the light, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event of Vehicle two was not attributed to this vehicle. Therefore, the responsibility for the crash lies primarily with the driver of Vehicle one.
