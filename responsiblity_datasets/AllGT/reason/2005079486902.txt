The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the left, crossed the center lane, and entered the second eastbound lane, where it was struck by V2 (the 2000 Ford Ranger pickup) in a sideswipe configuration. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining its lane and encroached into oncoming traffic, causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming, which further supports their responsibility for the accident.
