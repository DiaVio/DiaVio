The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was the vehicle departing the parking lot and attempting to make a left turn onto the divided trafficway. V2, the 2004 Ford Focus coupe, was traveling in the correct lane and direction on the trafficway. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 and was struck on the left side by V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to yield the right of way and not using the available restraints.
