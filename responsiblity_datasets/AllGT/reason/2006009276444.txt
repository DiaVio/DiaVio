The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop behind the vehicles in front of it and struck V2 in the rear. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and did not stop in time to avoid a collision. As a result, V2 was pushed into the rear of V3. Since V1 was the vehicle that initiated the chain reaction collision by rear-ending V2, it can be concluded that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
