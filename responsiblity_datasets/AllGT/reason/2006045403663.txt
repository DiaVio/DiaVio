The driver of V1 swerved to the right and then to the left, crossing the double yellow lines and ultimately losing control of the vehicle. This action of swerving and overcompensating led to V1 skidding off the roadway and colliding with a drainage ditch and embankment. The driver's claim of trying to avoid a collision with an unknown vehicle crossing into her lane suggests that she was not fully aware of her surroundings and may have made an incorrect judgment. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control and overcompensation contributed to the loss of control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's errors and lack of control.
