The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to react in a safe manner to the encroachment of the oncoming vehicle. The driver admitted to overreacting and not thinking about what she was doing. This poor directional control led to Vehicle #1 traveling off the edge of the road and into the ditch. Additionally, the driver was distracted, thinking about something unrelated to driving, which further contributed to the unsafe reaction. The poor road conditions, with the road covered in compacted snow, also played a role in the driver's inability to safely avoid the oncoming vehicle.
