The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic before making a left turn. She admitted to not wearing her glasses at the time of the crash, which may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance. V1 stated that she looked in the direction of V2 but did not see it before starting her turn. This indicates a driver recognition error and a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1994 Toyota Camry) was traveling within their lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the collision.
