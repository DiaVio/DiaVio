The reason for this is that V1 failed to turn and continued straight up the curbed island, ultimately hitting a traffic light pole. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, and the critical reason for this event was poor directional control. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, leading to the collision.
