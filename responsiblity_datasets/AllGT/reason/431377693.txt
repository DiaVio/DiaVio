The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and passed V2 on the left side after the initial impact. V1's horn was also blowing, indicating aggressive and reckless behavior. Additionally, V1 crossed multiple lanes, jumped curbs, and ultimately crashed into a brick wall, indicating a loss of control and failure to maintain proper lane discipline. These actions demonstrate a disregard for traffic laws and safety, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
