The reason for this is that V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to make a left-hand turn at the intersection. V1 had initially yielded, but then decided to proceed with the turn, causing the collision with V2. Additionally, the fact that V1 is an inexperienced driver may have contributed to the misjudgment of the situation.
