The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted that he did not realize he was in the left turn only lane and failed to recognize that the vehicle in front of him was stopped. This recognition error led to the collision with Vehicle 2 (the Lexus). Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was driving a rental car and stated that it was his first time on that particular roadway, indicating a lack of familiarity with the area. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of him and his lack of familiarity with the roadway.
