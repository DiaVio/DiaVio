The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which led to a decision error in not being able to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle that encroached into V1's lane. The driver's failure to realize that caution was required and the inability to control the vehicle's speed contributed to the crash.
