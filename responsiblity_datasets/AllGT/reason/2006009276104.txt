The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was attempting to make a left turn onto the highway, crossing over to the northbound lanes. However, due to the presence of the grass median, V1 was unable to make a clean turn and ended up heading north in lane 3 instead. This improper maneuver put V1 in the path of V2 (the Honda Civic) traveling south in lane 3, resulting in a collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene of the accident, which further indicates their responsibility for the incident. It is important to note that the driver of V1 claimed to have lent the vehicle to a friend, but since there is no information about the driver on the police report, it is not possible to determine the exact age or identity of the driver.
