The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by turning her head to look at the occupant in the back seat, which caused her to fail to notice that traffic was stopped ahead. Additionally, V1's brakes locked up and swerved to the right, resulting in the collision with the back of V2 (the 2007 Honda Accord). V1's distraction, combined with the congested traffic and failure to look far enough ahead, contributed to the accident. The driver's fatigue and sickness, as well as being ten weeks pregnant, may have also affected her ability to focus and react appropriately in the situation. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in traffic and there is no indication of any fault or contributing factors on the part of the driver. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
