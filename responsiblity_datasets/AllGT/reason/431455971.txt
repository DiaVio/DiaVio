The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it lost control on the snow-covered roadway, crossed over the double yellow line, and impacted V2 in an offset frontal crash configuration. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle in the snowy conditions and crossed into the opposing lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that the case occupant of V1 was not restrained by the available seat belt further contributes to the responsibility of V1 for the serious injuries sustained in the crash.
