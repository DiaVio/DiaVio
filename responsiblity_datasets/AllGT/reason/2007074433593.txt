The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by the police activity on the south side of the separator. She stated that she was looking left at the police activity and when she returned her attention to the front, she realized that V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Lumina) was slowing down. This distraction caused her to fail to notice V2 slowing down in front of her, resulting in her colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
