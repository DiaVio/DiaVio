The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed on a residential street with a posted speed limit of 25 mph/40 kmph. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted inside the vehicle, which likely contributed to their loss of control at the curve and subsequent impact with the curb. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and their distracted driving behavior ultimately led to the collision with the tree, resulting in significant damage to the vehicle and injuries to the driver.
