The driver of V1 admitted to swerving onto the north shoulder to avoid a slower moving vehicle, but then overcompensated and lost control of the vehicle. This action caused V1 to re-enter the roadway and cross into lane one and then lane two, where it was struck by V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the critical reason was identified as overcompensation due to the driver's inattentiveness and failure to look far enough ahead. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1997 Toyota Corolla) refused to comment on the collision, and no critical reason was assigned to V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's actions and loss of control.
