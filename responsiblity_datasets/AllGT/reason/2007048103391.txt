The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 121 kmph (75 mph), which exceeds the speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). This excessive speed made it difficult for the driver to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle that was changing lanes. The driver's inability to react appropriately, combined with the excessive speed, led to the loss of control of V1, resulting in the vehicle rotating, leaving the roadway, and ultimately rolling over. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others.
