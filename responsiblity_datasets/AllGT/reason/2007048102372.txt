The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 and did not react in time to the stopped vehicle. The driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 would continue moving and did not anticipate the need to stop. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, having worked a ten-hour shift and being awake for fourteen hours, which may have impaired their judgment and reaction time. It is important for drivers to always maintain a safe following distance and be alert to the actions of other vehicles on the road, especially when driving under conditions such as fatigue.
