The reason for this is as follows: 1. The driver of V1 was found to have a blood/alcohol level of 0.185, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This indicates that the driver was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. 2. The investigating officer's report was positive for alcohol, further supporting the fact that the driver was intoxicated. 3. The driver had a significant medical history of alcohol intake, which suggests a potential pattern of alcohol abuse. 4. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road. 5. There was no indication that the driver attempted any evasive maneuvers, suggesting a lack of awareness or impaired judgment. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which impaired their ability to safely negotiate the curve and maintain control of the vehicle.
