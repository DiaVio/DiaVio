The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 reportedly departed the right pavement edge and subsequently re-directed back into the travel lanes, traversing the lanes in a counterclockwise rotation. As Vehicle 1 entered the northbound travel lane, it was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan). This indicates that Vehicle 1 crossed into the path of Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
