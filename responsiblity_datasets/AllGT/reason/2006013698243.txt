The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the 2006 Ford 500, admitted that she may not have stopped at the stop sign and was distracted by talking on her cell phone. This indicates that she failed to yield the right of way at the intersection, which led to the collision with V2, the 1995 GMC pickup. V2, on the other hand, stated that he did not have time to react and could not avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 was following the rules of the road and was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to stop at the stop sign and being distracted by a cell phone.
