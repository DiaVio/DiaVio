The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V1 turned left in the intersection and crossed the path of V2 (the Chevrolet Cavalier), resulting in the collision. Although the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was not coded to this vehicle, the fact that V1 was making a left turn indicates that they failed to yield the right of way to V2, which was traveling straight through the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and encroaching into the path of V2.
