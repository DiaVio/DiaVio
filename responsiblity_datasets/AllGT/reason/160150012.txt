The reason for this is that V2 was traveling west in lane one of the three lane, one-way roadway and entered the intersection, colliding with the right side of V1, the 2004 Honda CR-V utility vehicle. V2's impact caused V1 to sustain serious injury and come to rest on the roadway to the east of the intersection. Therefore, V2's actions of entering the intersection and colliding with V1 indicate that it is primarily responsible for the crash.
