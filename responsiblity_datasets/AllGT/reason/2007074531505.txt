The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a left turn when the signal turned yellow, assuming that V2 (the driver of the 1991 Ford Aerostar) would stop. However, V2 did not stop and collided with the right side of V1. This indicates that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2, which ultimately led to the collision. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and decision to make a left turn when it was not safe to do so make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
