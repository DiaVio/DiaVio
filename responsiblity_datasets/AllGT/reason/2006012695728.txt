The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. This decision error led to the vehicle sliding and being unable to stop, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not realize that caution was required due to the rain and wet roads, further contributing to the accident.
