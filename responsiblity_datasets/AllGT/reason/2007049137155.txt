The reason for this is that the driver of V1, a sixteen-year-old male, was not licensed to drive and had limited experience behind the wheel. The driver's inexperience and poor directional control were identified as the critical factors leading to the crash. Additionally, the driver was not familiar with the route and was driving a vehicle he had only driven three times before. These factors contributed to V1 sliding off the road and ultimately rolling over.
