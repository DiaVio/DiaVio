The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in the northbound lane but crossed over the center lane lines and entered V1's lane of travel. This resulted in a head-on collision with V1, the 2011 Toyota Highlander compact utility vehicle. Therefore, V2's failure to stay in its designated lane and crossing into oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
