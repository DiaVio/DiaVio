The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted internally, specifically claiming to have been stung by a fire ant and trying to slap and kill it at the time of impact. This internal distraction caused the driver of V1 to fail to look far enough ahead and not see V2 (the 2003 Honda CRV) slowing down for stopped traffic. As a result, V1's front struck the back of V2, initiating the chain reaction that led to the collision with V3 (the 2001 Ford F-250 pickup truck).
