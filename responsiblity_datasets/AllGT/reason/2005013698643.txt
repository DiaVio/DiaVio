The driver of V1 stated that she looked both ways but could not see any vehicles due to the snow. Despite this, she proceeded to pull out of the private drive. Additionally, the driver mentioned that her tires were spinning in the snow, indicating that she may not have had full control of the vehicle. The associate factors for V1 include poor road surface and an inexperienced driver. These factors contribute to the driver's inability to properly assess the situation and make a safe decision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1994 Ford Escort) stated that he saw V1 pulling out of the drive and tried to avoid the collision by steering to the left. He also mentioned that he locked up the brakes but could not stop in time. While V2 may have attempted to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1. V1's decision to proceed into traffic without clear visibility and control of the vehicle is the main contributing factor to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their actions of pulling out into traffic without proper visibility and control.
