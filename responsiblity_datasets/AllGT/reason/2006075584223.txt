The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the actions of other vehicles and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 2001 Ford F-150). V1 was in the left turn lane, waiting for the light to turn red before making the turn. However, the driver assumed that the westbound vehicles were stopping and proceeded with the turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This false assumption and failure to yield resulted in the collision with V2.
