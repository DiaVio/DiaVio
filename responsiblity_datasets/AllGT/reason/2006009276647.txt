The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, turning left at the intersection." Although the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was listed as "type of driver error unknown," it is mentioned that the driver of V1 seemed to be driving aggressively and probably ran a red light. Therefore, V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and potentially running a red light indicates that they were at fault for the accident.
