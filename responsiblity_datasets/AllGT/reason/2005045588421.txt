The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way while attempting to turn left onto the arterial road. The driver of Vehicle #1 misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2 (2002 Honda Odyssey) and turned into its path, resulting in the collision. The driver's statement that Vehicle #2 had its right turn signal on was not deemed credible, as there was no evidence to support this claim. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was traveling on the arterial road and had the right of way. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that another non-contact vehicle turned left at the intersection, and Vehicle #1 followed that vehicle, leaving her virtually no time to avoid the crash. However, this does not absolve Vehicle #1 of responsibility for failing to yield. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their failure to yield while turning left at the intersection.
