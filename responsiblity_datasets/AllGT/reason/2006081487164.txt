The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve to the right. This caused V1 to lose control and cross the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 was a 16-year-old with limited experience further supports the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
