The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 crossed onto the raised concrete center curb median into westbound traffic, then crossed over both eastbound lanes of traffic, and ultimately struck the guardrail on the right roadside. This indicates a clear failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lanes of travel. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to experiencing difficulties with the steering of the vehicle, stating that the wheel kept "sticking." This suggests a mechanical issue or lack of proper maintenance, which further contributes to the driver's inability to control the vehicle. Furthermore, the driver's fatigue, combined with the use of a prescription medication that could cause dizziness and fatigue, as well as her inexperience as a learner's permit holder, are additional factors that contribute to her poor performance and inability to control the vehicle effectively. Overall, the driver of V1 demonstrated a lack of skill, control, and attentiveness, which ultimately led to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
