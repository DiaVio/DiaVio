The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was changing lanes without adequately checking the rear mirrors, resulting in inadequate surveillance. This led to Vehicle #1 cutting in front of Vehicle #2, causing the collision. Additionally, Vehicle #1 was traveling over the left lane line, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. While Vehicle #2 did swerve in an attempt to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for the unsafe lane change and failure to properly check mirrors before changing lanes.
