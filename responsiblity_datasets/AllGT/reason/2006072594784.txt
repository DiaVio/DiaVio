The reason for this is that V1 encroached over the left lane line and struck V2 in the rear right corner. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle and failed to stay in their original travel lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level of 0.216, which impaired their ability to control the vehicle. Since V2 left the crash scene and no information is available about the driver or the vehicle, it is not possible to assign any responsibility to V2 in this case.
