The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected action of V2 stopping for traffic. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the back of V2. Additionally, V1's inadequate surveillance was an associated factor in the crash, suggesting that the driver may not have been paying enough attention to the road and the actions of other vehicles. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with higher speed." However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, indicating that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their excessive speed and inadequate surveillance.
