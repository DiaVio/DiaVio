The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 decelerated (slowed) in her travel lane for unknown reasons, causing Vehicle 1 (1999 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan) to strike and under ride the back plane of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 2's sudden deceleration was a contributing factor to the collision.
