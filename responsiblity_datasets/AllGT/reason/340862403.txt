The reason for this is that the case vehicle, the 2015 Honda Pilot SUV, was traveling in the outside lane of a one-way roadway and was passing through the intersection. V2, which was eastbound in the inside lane of the intersecting trafficway, entered the path of the case vehicle. As a result, V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle, causing it to rotate clockwise and flip over onto its left side. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident as it failed to yield the right of way and entered the path of the case vehicle.
