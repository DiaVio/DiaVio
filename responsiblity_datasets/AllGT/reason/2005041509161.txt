The driver of V1 admitted to not being able to stop in time and stated that the reason for the collision was partially due to the gap distance and partially due to the wet pavement. The critical reason for the critical event for V1 was a decision error, specifically following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not familiar with the roadway and it was their first time driving a rental vehicle, which may have contributed to their lack of comfort and familiarity with the car. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and react appropriately to the slowing traffic ahead.
