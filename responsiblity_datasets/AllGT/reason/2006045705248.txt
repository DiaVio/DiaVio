The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was attempting to cross the arterial roadway from the driveway and turn left (north), but a portion of its rear was left hanging out in the left southbound lane. This action created a hazardous situation for other vehicles traveling in that lane, including V2. V2 (the 2007 Chevrolet Impala) was southbound in the far left southbound lane and recognized that V1 was hanging out in its travel path. The driver of V2 began heavy braking to avoid a collision. However, due to V1's position in the roadway, V2's front impacted the left rear side of V1. While V2's driver could have potentially steered right into the adjacent lane to avoid the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for creating the hazardous situation by not fully clearing the southbound lane before stopping in the crossover. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash because it failed to fully clear the southbound lane while attempting to cross the arterial roadway.
