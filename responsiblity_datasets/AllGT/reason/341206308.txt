The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the right lane and began to drift into the left lane. V1 then attempted to steer the vehicle back to the right, but lost control and ultimately collided with a sign post and a concrete bridge pillar. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
