The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), which is 16 kmph (10 mph) over the posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). This excessive speed caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve. Additionally, the driver failed to look far enough ahead and did not anticipate the curve properly. These factors, combined with the dark mountain road and the reduced friction of the sand treatment on the roadway, contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and ultimately led to the rollover accident.
