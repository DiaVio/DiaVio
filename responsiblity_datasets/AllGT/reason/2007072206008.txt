The driver of V1 stated that he steered to the left in an attempt to avoid the crash, indicating that he was aware of the stopped vehicle in front of him (V2). However, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate evasive action," suggesting that the driver of V1 did not take appropriate measures to avoid the collision, such as braking and steering. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the traffic conditions.
