The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2 (the parked and unoccupied Kia Rondo), indicating that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance or paying attention to the road ahead. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, suggests that V1 may have been driving erratically or not staying within their lane. However, without further information or an interview with the driver of V1, the exact reason for the accident remains unknown.
