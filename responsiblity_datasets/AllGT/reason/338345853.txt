The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the right side of the roadway, sideswiped a tree, drove over a small footbridge, impacted the ground, and then collided with a tree. These series of events indicate that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to stay on the roadway, resulting in the multiple collisions. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 was unrestrained suggests a lack of precautionary measures taken, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
