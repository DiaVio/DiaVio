The driver of V1 admitted to not knowing that V2 had slowed down and was unsure why. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was "following too closely to respond to unexpected actions," further supporting the notion that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to respond to the slowing of V2.
