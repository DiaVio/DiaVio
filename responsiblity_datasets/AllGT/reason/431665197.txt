The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, possibly due to a medical episode. This loss of control caused V1 to travel off the south travel lanes and sideswipe a metal guardrail. Despite the driver's attempt to regain control by braking and steering, V1 then collided with a concrete barrier, resulting in a 280-degree rotation and coming to a rest in the left inboard travel lane. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unrestrained, which means he was not wearing a seatbelt. This lack of restraint likely contributed to the seriousness of his injuries. Overall, the driver's loss of control and failure to maintain the vehicle's position on the roadway, combined with his lack of restraint, make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
