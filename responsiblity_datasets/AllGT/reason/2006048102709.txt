The reason for this is that V1 traveled over the double center lane lines and struck the left side of V2 (the 1994 Chevrolet C1500 pickup). This indicates that V1 crossed into the opposite lane, causing the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, suggesting that V1 was at fault for encroaching into the opposite lane. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and attempted to steer to the right to avoid the collision but was unable to do so. Therefore, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's encroachment and not the primary cause of the crash.
