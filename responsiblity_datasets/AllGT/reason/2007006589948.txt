The driver reported that the trailer began to swerve left and right, eventually causing it to jackknife and flip over. He mentioned that he tried to brake but the trailer seemed to speed up instead of slowing down. He also admitted that he may have been traveling too fast. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1 was "this vehicle loss of control due to jackknife," indicating that the driver's inability to control the trailer was the main cause of the accident. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as "cargo shifted," suggesting that the load on the trailer may have contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, associated factors coded to the driver include conversation with passengers and traveling too fast while towing a trailer.

Therefore, based on the driver's own admission and the coding of the critical events and associated factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
