The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver has a history of epilepsy and experienced a seizure while making a left turn at the intersection. This physical impairment of the ability to act led to V1 running off the road and colliding with a power pole. Additionally, the driver's license was revoked due to his medical condition, indicating that he should not have been driving in the first place.
