The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and struck the back of V2 (the Ford F150 pickup truck) while it was stopped in lane two. Additionally, upon striking V2, V1 drove left across the two lanes of opposing traffic, indicating a lack of control and awareness of the surroundings. Furthermore, the driver of V1 reported being distracted by the dashboard light, which suggests a driver-related internal distraction. This distraction likely contributed to the driver's failure to notice and react to the stopped vehicle ahead in a timely manner. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance, control the vehicle, and react appropriately to the traffic situation makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
