The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed through a curve to the left, and then departed the roadway to the right, leaving tire marks in the grassy area. V1 then began to slide sideways and ultimately impacted a utility pole and a tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
