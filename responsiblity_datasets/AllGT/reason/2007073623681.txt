The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic, specifically V1 (the 1999 Pontiac Grand Am), before attempting to make a U-turn in the intersection. As a result, V1 collided with the front of V2, causing damage to both vehicles and debris from the crash striking V3 (the 2003 Ford Explorer). Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately survey the intersection and ensure it was safe to make the U-turn.
