The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, which is considered an illegal maneuver. The witness at the scene confirmed that the traffic light was red for westbound traffic when V1 entered the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to detect V2 prior to the crash and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and failure to detect the oncoming vehicle makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
