The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way and began her left turn as V2 entered the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 until it was too late to avoid the collision. This suggests a lack of adequate surveillance and inexperience on the part of the driver of V1. The fact that the driver of V1 was distracted by eating at the time of the crash further supports her responsibility for the accident.
