The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a store to her left while approaching the intersection. This external distraction caused her to misjudge the distance between her vehicle and Vehicle #2 (V2), leading to inadequate evasive action. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she probably did not apply enough braking force, resulting in the front of V1 striking the rear of V2. While the driver of V2 was waiting at the intersection with one hand on the gearshift and one hand on the steering wheel, his actions did not contribute to the crash. He was not engaged in any driving activity at the time and was not found to be at fault. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction, misjudgment of distance, and inadequate braking.
