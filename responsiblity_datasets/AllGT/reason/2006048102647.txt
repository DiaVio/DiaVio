The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking to the left to check for traffic, and failed to notice that V2 had stopped in front of them. This distraction caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was attributed to a driver-related factor, specifically external distraction. This further supports the conclusion that the driver of V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and the actions of other vehicles. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
