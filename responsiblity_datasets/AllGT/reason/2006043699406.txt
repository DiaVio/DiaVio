The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. V2 assumed that the traffic would yield to her when she entered the intersection after the light turned green. However, V1 was already approaching the intersection at a high speed and V2 did not have a chance to react before being struck. Therefore, V2's false assumption and failure to yield the right of way led to the collision.
