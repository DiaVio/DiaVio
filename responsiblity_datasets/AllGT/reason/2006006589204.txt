The driver of V1 admitted to traveling at a speed of approximately 105kmph (65 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 80kmph (50 mph) for the curved section of the highway. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the roadway and was engaged in conversation with passengers, indicating a lack of attention and focus on the road. Furthermore, when a non-contact vehicle began drifting into V1's lane, instead of braking or taking evasive action, the driver panicked and accelerated, which resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle. This decision to accelerate rather than react appropriately to the situation demonstrates poor judgment and a failure to respond effectively to unexpected actions of others. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the roadway conditions, unfamiliarity with the road, and failing to respond appropriately to the drifting vehicle.
