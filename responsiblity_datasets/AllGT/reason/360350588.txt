The reason for this is that V1's driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, resulting in V1 traveling out of its lane, impacting jersey barriers multiple times, and ultimately coming to rest in the southbound lanes. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the lane contributed to the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt further increases their responsibility for the severity of the injuries sustained.
