The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding through the stop sign. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see the other vehicle and believed that the intersection was a four-way stop. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1989 Cadillac Sedan Deville) saw V1 stopped at the stop sign and assumed that V1 would remain stopped until they passed by. While the driver of V2 may have been fatigued, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with V1 for not properly observing the intersection and proceeding without ensuring it was safe to do so. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance.
