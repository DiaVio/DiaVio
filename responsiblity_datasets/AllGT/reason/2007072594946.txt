The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet roadway conditions caused by the rain. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and reason codes, which indicate that the loss of vehicle control was due to traveling too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control further supports their responsibility for the crash.
