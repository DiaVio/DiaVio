The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions while towing the trailer. The driver admitted to initially traveling at 89 kmph (55 mph) and later changed it to 80 kmph (50 mph), both of which exceed the advisory warning on the trailer stating that it should not be pulled at a speed exceeding 45 mph. This excessive speed likely contributed to the trailer fishtailing and the subsequent loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's fatigue from sleeping in the vehicle for only a few hours during a long cross-country trip, as well as her work-related back injury causing discomfort and stiffness, may have impaired her ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle while towing the trailer. Furthermore, the driver's lack of familiarity with the roadway and discomfort with towing the trailer in a vehicle she had owned for less than a month could have also contributed to the loss of control. Overall, V1's primary responsibility for the crash can be attributed to the driver's error of traveling too fast for the conditions while towing the trailer, as well as other contributing factors such as fatigue, discomfort, and lack of familiarity with the vehicle and roadway.
