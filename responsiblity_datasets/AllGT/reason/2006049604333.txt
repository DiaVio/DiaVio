The critical reason for V1's involvement in the crash was a driver-related decision factor, specifically a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of other vehicles. The driver of V1 thought there was enough time to complete the left turn, but failed to accurately assess the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the 1992 Volvo 940) was traveling in its designated lane and attempting to pass through the intersection. The driver of V2 stated that there were two vehicles driving in front of her, blocking her view of V1. Despite this, she observed that V1 did not stop at the left turn lane and continued with its left turn. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of other vehicles, leading to the collision with V2.
