The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was inattentive to the traffic ahead and failed to notice that the traffic was stopping. This lack of attention led to her hitting the right rear corner of the vehicle ahead of her. Additionally, V1 fled from the scene of the crash, indicating a disregard for the consequences of her actions. Furthermore, it is mentioned that V1 was later apprehended and arrested for DUI. This suggests that she may have been impaired at the time of the collision, which further supports her primary responsibility. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1997 Saturn SL1 sedan) was slowing for traffic ahead and had almost come to a complete stop when he was hit from behind. V2's actions indicate that he was following the rules of the road and taking appropriate measures to avoid a collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to her inattentiveness, fleeing from the scene, and potential impairment.
