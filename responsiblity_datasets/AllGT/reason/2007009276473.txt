The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention to the traffic light and assuming it was green, which led to her turning against the red light and entering the intersection. This action caused V2 (the 2006 Mercedes R350) to swerve and ultimately collide with V1. Additionally, V2 then struck V3 (the Honda CRV) after colliding with V1. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and enter the intersection against the red light is the main reason for the accident.
