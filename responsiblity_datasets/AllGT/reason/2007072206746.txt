The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down to adjust the radio just before the crash. This internal distraction caused her to not see V2 (the 2001 Ford Escape) approaching the intersection, resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, stated that she saw V1 just prior to the crash and attempted to brake to avoid the collision. This indicates that V2 was aware of the situation and took appropriate action, whereas V1's distraction prevented her from seeing V2 and taking evasive measures. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to see V2 make her primarily responsible for the accident.
