The reason for this is that V1 did not stop for traffic and collided with the rear of V2 (the 2005 Jeep Liberty) while it was stopped due to congestion. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and did not exercise proper caution while driving. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by looking above at the traffic signal, which further contributed to the collision.
