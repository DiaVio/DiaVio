The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the green traffic signal. The driver of V2 stated that he never saw V1 prior to the crash and took no avoidance actions. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to properly assess the intersection before proceeding. Additionally, no associated factors were coded to V2, further suggesting that the driver's inadequate surveillance was the main contributing factor to the accident.
