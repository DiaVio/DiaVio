The driver of V1 admitted to taking the sharp turn at a speed well over the advisory limit, indicating a decision error and being too fast for the curve/turn. This caused V1 to encroach into V2's travel lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver's lack of experience with the vehicle, having only driven it a few times, may have contributed to the driver's inability to safely navigate the turn. While V2 (the 2005 Volvo XC90) attempted to steer left at the last minute to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for driving at an excessive speed and encroaching into the other vehicle's lane. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error, excessive speed for the curve/turn, and encroachment into V2's travel lane.
