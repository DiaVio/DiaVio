The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of their vehicle and crossed into the eastbound travel lane while attempting to avoid a non-contact vehicle. This action resulted in the collision with V2 (the Toyota Camry) that was waiting to turn left into the driveway. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to knowing that the trailer brakes were not working properly but still proceeded to drive without ensuring they were fixed. This failure to address the known issue with the trailer brakes contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of their vehicle and their negligence in addressing the faulty trailer brakes make them primarily responsible for the accident.
