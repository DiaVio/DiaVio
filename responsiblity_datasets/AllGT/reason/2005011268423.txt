The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, causing the vehicle to leave the eastbound lane, cross the westbound lane, and ultimately crash into various objects before rolling over and coming to a rest. The driver admitted to feeling tired and falling asleep while driving, which led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's fatigue, resulting from only having 3 hours of sleep the night before and a long workday, was identified as the contributing factor for the accident.
