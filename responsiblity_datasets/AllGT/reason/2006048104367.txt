The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, but failed to adequately surveil the area before proceeding. The driver stated that they looked both ways but did not see the other vehicle (V2). Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver has 80% hearing loss and was not wearing their hearing aid, which may have contributed to their failure to detect the presence of V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the intersection before making the left turn make them primarily responsible for the accident.
