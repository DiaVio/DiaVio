The driver of V1 made a left turn without having a clear view of oncoming traffic, as stated by the driver himself. This indicates that V1 turned with an obstructed view, which is a driver-related error. V2 (the driver of the Volvo S-70) stated that he was traveling in the correct lane and did not change lanes to go around any vehicles. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the accident.
