The police report indicates that V2 did not stop at the proper place, suggesting that they failed to yield the right of way at the intersection. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment," indicating that V2 crossed the path of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the stop sign and encroachment into the path of V1 led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
