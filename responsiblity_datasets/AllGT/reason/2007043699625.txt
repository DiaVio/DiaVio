The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction over the left lane line. This indicates that V2 crossed over into the oncoming traffic lane, which resulted in the collision with V1. Additionally, no Critical Reason was coded for V2, suggesting that there were no driver-related factors that contributed to the accident. Therefore, V2's failure to stay within their designated lane and encroaching into oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
