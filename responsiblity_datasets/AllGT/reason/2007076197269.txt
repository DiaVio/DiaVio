The reason for V1's responsibility is that she admitted to looking down inside her vehicle for a moment, which resulted in her not paying attention to the road. When she looked up, V2 (the Toyota 4-Runner) had stopped in the middle of the roadway. V1 failed to react in time and ran into the back of V2's trailer. V2, on the other hand, was slowing down for traffic ahead and was almost stopped when the collision occurred. The driver of V2 saw V1 through his rear-view mirror and noticed that she was not paying attention. He attempted to steer out of the way to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead make her primarily responsible for the accident.
