The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 drifted into the westbound travel lane while negotiating a right turning curve, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver oversteered and braked, further contributing to the loss of control. These actions ultimately led to Vehicle 1 departing the roadway and colliding with the tree.
