The driver of V1 misjudged the gap between his vehicle and V2, resulting in him pulling out and turning left in front of V2. This misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2 is considered a driver-related factor and a critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he is not supposed to be driving in low-level light situations, indicating a potential visibility issue. On the other hand, the driver of V2 saw V1 inching out slowly from the driveway but assumed that he would stay put. She attempted to swerve to the left to avoid the crash, indicating that she took evasive action. Therefore, V2 is not thought to have contributed to the crash.
