The driver of V2 made a left turn across three eastbound lanes from a restaurant drive-through without having a clear view of lane three or V1 approaching. Despite the drivers in the first two eastbound lanes waving him to go ahead, he failed to ensure that it was safe to complete the turn. As a result, V2 struck the right rear of V1 with its front right bumper, causing V1 to roll over and skid across the roadway. V2's decision error of turning with an obstructed view and failing to exercise caution when making the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
