The driver of Vehicle #1 lost control of the vehicle and traveled off the left side of the road, ultimately colliding with a fence and utility pole. Additionally, the driver fled the scene of the crash and was never located. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's unknown type of error, traveling too fast for the conditions, and leaving the scene of the crash.
