The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the congested, stop-and-go traffic flow. The driver made an evasive action to avoid rear-ending a vehicle that stopped suddenly in front of him, but was unable to stop in time to avoid hitting V2 and V3. The driver's decision error of traveling too fast for the conditions and being unable to respond to unexpected actions of other road users contributed to the accident. Additionally, factors such as fatigue and work stress may have also played a role in the driver's ability to react appropriately in the situation.
