The reason for this is that V1 made an unsafe lane change without adequately checking for other vehicles in the adjacent lane. The driver of V1 failed to recognize the presence of V2 (the driver of the Mercury Grand Marquis) and changed lanes directly into its path, resulting in a collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was distracted by external factors, such as focusing on the off-ramp and conversing with his passenger. These distractions likely contributed to the driver's failure to properly surveil the adjacent lane before changing lanes. On the other hand, the driver of V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident as there is no evidence to suggest that they were at fault. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was another vehicle encroaching from the adjacent lane, indicating that V2 was already in its designated lane and did not make any unsafe maneuvers. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to an unsafe lane change and inadequate surveillance, while V2 does not bear primary responsibility based on the information provided.
