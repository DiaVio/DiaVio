The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel and not remembering anything about the crash. This indicates that the driver was not in control of the vehicle and was unable to maintain their lane. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which supports the driver's statement of crossing over the centerline into the westbound lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been drinking heavily and had not slept the night before the crash. These factors likely contributed to the driver's impaired judgment and ability to operate the vehicle safely. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1997 Ford Ranger pickup) stated that she saw V1 drift over the centerline but then return to its own lane. She attempted to avoid the collision by letting off the accelerator and braking, but was unable to avoid V1 when it crossed over the centerline again. While the driver of V2 may have had some contributing factors such as the medications she was taking for her pre-existing health condition, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's impaired state and falling asleep at the wheel. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired state, falling asleep at the wheel, and crossing over the centerline into the westbound lane.
