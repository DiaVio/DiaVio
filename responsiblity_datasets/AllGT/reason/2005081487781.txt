The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver made an improper lane change without adequately surveilling the surrounding traffic. The driver stated that they looked in their mirror before changing lanes but did not see V2 (the Honda Accord). This indicates a failure to properly check blind spots and ensure that it was safe to change lanes. Additionally, the fact that V1's left front side contacted the right front side of V2 suggests that V1 did not properly yield the right of way to V2, as V2 was already in the lane and traveling straight. Overall, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the collision.
