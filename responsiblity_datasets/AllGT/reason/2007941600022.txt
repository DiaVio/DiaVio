The reason for this is that V1, an unknown vehicle, hit the back of V2, causing V2 to lose control and subsequently collide with V3. V1 then fled the scene without stopping. The witness who stopped at the scene reported that a white vehicle cut into V2's lane and hit its back, corroborating V2's account of being hit from behind. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and causing the initial collision makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
