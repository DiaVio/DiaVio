The reason for this is that V2 was exiting a private driveway and attempting to turn left into westbound traffic. The driver of V2 stated that he looked both ways before making the turn, but did not see V1. This indicates a driver-related recognition error, specifically inadequate surveillance. The driver failed to adequately look or failed to see V1 approaching in the two-way left turn lane. On the other hand, V1 was stopped in the two-way left turn lane, waiting to merge into eastbound traffic. The driver of V1 reported that she was looking over her right shoulder at eastbound traffic, indicating that she was aware of her surroundings and waiting for an opportunity to merge. The critical precrash event for V1 was attributed to the encroachment of V2 from the driveway, turning into the opposite direction. However, the critical reason for the event was not attributed to V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's inadequate surveillance.
