The driver of V1 was traveling westbound in the second lane and for unknown reasons, the vehicle began drifting to the left and entered the opposite direction traffic lane. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. The driver continued drifting and sideswiped the concrete base of a pillar, and then subsequently collided with another pillar. Although the driver claimed that another vehicle swerved him over, no other vehicle was mentioned in the police report and the angle of trajectory from the first contact pillar to final rest appeared very shallow. This suggests that the driver's claim may not be accurate or supported by evidence. Additionally, the driver had received less than five hours of sleep prior to the crash, which raises the possibility of falling asleep at the wheel. This could be a contributing factor to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the lack of evidence supporting the involvement of another vehicle, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
