The driver of V1 attempted to pass V2 (1997 Ford LTD 9000) on the same side of the road, while V2 was making a wide right turn onto a roadway. As a result, the left side of V1 struck the right rear tire of V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 is listed as "Other motor vehicle in lane: Traveling in same direction while decelerating," indicating that V1 was engaging in aggressive driving behavior. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their decision to pass V2 in an unsafe manner.
