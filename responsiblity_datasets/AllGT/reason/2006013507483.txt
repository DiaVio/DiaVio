The driver of V1 drifted off the roadway to the right and then overcompensated by steering to the left, causing the vehicle to rotate and ultimately crash into the earth mound on the east side of the ditch. The driver's actions, combined with factors such as unfamiliarity with the vehicle, low tread depth on several tires, wet roads, and the effects of the chemical inhalant he was "huffing," all contributed to the driver's loss of control and the subsequent crash.
