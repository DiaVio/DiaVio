The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely behind Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1995 Toyota T100 pickup truck, and failed to maintain a safe distance. This resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction that involved V2 colliding with the back of Vehicle 3 (V3), the four-door sedan.
