The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it veered to the right and crossed the mountable median barrier, crossed the service road, and mounted the barrier curb. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the subsequent collisions with the fire hydrant and palm tree.
