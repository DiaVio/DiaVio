The critical reason assigned to V1 is "misjudgment of gap or other's speed." This suggests that V1 failed to accurately assess the distance and speed of V2 (the 2002 Honda CRV SUV) when attempting to change lanes. The damage to V1 indicates that the driver tried to steer to the right at the last moment to avoid the impact, further indicating their misjudgment.
