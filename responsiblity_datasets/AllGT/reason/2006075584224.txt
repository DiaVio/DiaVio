The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver reported that she lost control of the vehicle after it traversed an icy patch of road, and despite attempting to regain control by braking and steering left, she was unsuccessful. This indicates that the driver failed to adjust her speed to match the road conditions, which ultimately led to the loss of control and the rollover. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error of traveling too fast for the icy conditions.
