The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle lost control due to hydroplaning caused by the worn tread on the rear tires. This indicates a lack of proper maintenance and negligence on the part of the driver in ensuring the vehicle's tires were in good condition for driving in wet conditions. Additionally, the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle while encountering standing water on the roadway, which further contributes to their responsibility for the accident.
