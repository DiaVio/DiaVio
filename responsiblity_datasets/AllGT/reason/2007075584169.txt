The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that he thought V2 was turning right at the intersection and attempted to make his turn. However, V2 was actually traveling straight in lane two, resulting in the collision between the front of V2 and the left side of V1. V1's false assumption of V2's actions shows a lack of proper observation and judgment, leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
