The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded through the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. This decision error of failing to stop for the traffic control device (TCD) is a clear violation of traffic laws and contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed that their view of the stop sign was obstructed by a parked delivery truck, but this does not excuse their failure to stop and proceed safely through the intersection. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in the westbound lane and had the right of way as they were not required to stop at the intersection. V2 was unable to avoid the collision with V1, as V1 attempted to avoid the collision by turning right and braking, but was still struck by V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2.
