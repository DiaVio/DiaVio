The driver of V1 was under the influence of prescription drugs, as confirmed by the medical records. These drugs, including Benzodiazepines and Opiates, can cause drowsiness and impair cognitive function. The driver admitted to feeling sleepy and having difficulty staying focused. Additionally, the driver was distracted by her crying child in the backseat, which took her attention off the roadway. Furthermore, a witness reported that V1 had been weaving and swerving for a significant distance prior to the crash, indicating erratic lane usage. The driver's husband also stated that she had suffered a broken wrist in a previous crash just one week before, which may have affected her ability to safely operate the vehicle. Considering all these factors, it is clear that the driver of V1 was not in a suitable condition to drive and failed to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the run-off-roadway crash.
