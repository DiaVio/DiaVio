The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn without the right of way, which is a violation of traffic rules. V1's front struck the left side of V2 (the 2004 Ford F-150 pick-up truck), indicating that V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic while making the left turn. Additionally, the critical reason for V1's driver was coded as a false assumption of others' actions. This suggests that the driver of V1 assumed that V2 would also turn left, leading to the collision. However, this assumption was incorrect, and V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the accident.
