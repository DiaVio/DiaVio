The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1996 Dodge Ram 2500) while proceeding straight on a two-lane state highway. This action by Vehicle 1 caused the collision with Vehicle 2, resulting in severe damage to Vehicle 1 and serious injuries to its driver.
