The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn in front of V2 (the 2000 Cadillac sedan), failing to yield the right of way. V1's driver was distracted and inattentive, thinking about personal issues and not aware of V2's presence when making the left turn. Additionally, V1's driver had limited experience, being a new driver with only 8 months of driving experience. The fatigue from lack of sleep may have also contributed to the driver's inattention.
