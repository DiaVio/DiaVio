The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V2 did not detect V1 until the impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to properly assess the situation before making the left turn.
