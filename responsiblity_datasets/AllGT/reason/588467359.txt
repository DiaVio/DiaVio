The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a left U-turn at the area of the painted divider/beginning of the dedicated left turn lane, in order to travel south. This action caused Vehicle 1 to cross into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2008 Jeep Wrangler compact utility vehicle), resulting in the collision.
