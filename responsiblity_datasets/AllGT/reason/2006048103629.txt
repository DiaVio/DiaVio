The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). This lack of attention and awareness resulted in V1 sliding into the intersection and colliding with V2, causing the accident.
