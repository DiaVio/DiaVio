The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 swerved left to avoid stopping vehicles and lost control, causing the vehicle to slide into the southbound travel lanes and collide with Vehicle 1 (2006 Ford Escape). This initial collision then led to Vehicle 2 being spun counterclockwise and subsequently struck by Vehicle 3 (2001 Toyota Avalon).
