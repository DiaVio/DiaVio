The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that he was driving at a higher rate of speed and failed to control his vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. He did not make any evasive actions to avoid the impact, despite having the opportunity to do so. Additionally, the presence of several open beer cans inside V1's vehicle suggests possible impairment, which could have contributed to his poor driving performance.
