The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related decision error by turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver of V1 reported that she was unable to see opposing traffic in the first westbound lane due to heavy congestion and stopped traffic in the adjacent lanes. This obstructed view led to the collision with V2 (the Toyota Camry) as V1 turned left into the path of oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision to turn left without a clear view of the opposing traffic.
