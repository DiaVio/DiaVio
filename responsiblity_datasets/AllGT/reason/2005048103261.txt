The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the critical reason coded for V1, which states "inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)." V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in her entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so, leading to the collision with V2. V2, on the other hand, was driving within the speed limit and had the right of way as they were traveling straight through the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing, turning into opposite direction," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn.
