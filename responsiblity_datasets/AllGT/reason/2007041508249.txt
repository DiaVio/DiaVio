The driver of V1 admitted to not noticing that the traffic light was red as he approached the intersection. He stated that he was daydreaming and failed to look to either side ahead for cross traffic. Additionally, he failed to stop for the traffic control device. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was inattentive and did not exercise proper surveillance, ultimately causing the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Pontiac G6) had a green light and was proceeding to make a left turn. He stated that he did not see the other vehicle prior to impact, suggesting that he was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inattentiveness, failure to observe the traffic light, and inadequate surveillance.
