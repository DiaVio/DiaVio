The driver of V1 stated that he did not realize the vehicle in front of him was stopping as fast as it was and attempted to go around it by braking hard and steering left. However, he failed to see V2 (the 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee) in the oncoming lane, resulting in a collision. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side, and the critical reason for this event was an incorrect evasive action. If the driver of V1 had braked and remained in his own lane or braked and steered off the road to the right, the crash could have been avoided. Additionally, inadequate surveillance was coded as an associated factor because the driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead.
