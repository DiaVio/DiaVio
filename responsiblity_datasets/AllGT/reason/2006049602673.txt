The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one made a false assumption of the actions of vehicle two (2004 Ford F-150). The driver of vehicle one stated that they saw vehicle two coming down the road and thought that the other vehicle would see them and stop. However, the driver of vehicle two stated that they never saw vehicle one. Therefore, it can be concluded that the driver of vehicle one failed to yield the right of way to vehicle two, resulting in the collision.
