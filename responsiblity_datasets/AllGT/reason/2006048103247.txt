The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn. Despite waiting for more than ten seconds, V1 did not check to see if lane one of the southbound lanes was clear before proceeding with the turn. This lack of proper surveillance led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver's vision was blocked by the school bus and rush hour traffic, which were associative factors contributing to the inadequate surveillance.
