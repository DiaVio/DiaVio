The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was unable to stop and subsequently rear-ended Vehicle 2 (the 2008 Ford F-250 pickup truck) which had come to a stop due to traffic congestion. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the stopped vehicle ahead.
