The injuries sustained by the case occupant, such as aortic laceration, kidney laceration, liver laceration, and duodenum laceration, were attributed to contact with the right instrument panel, indicating that the impact came from the right side of the vehicle. Additionally, the occipital condyle fracture was attributed to contact with the roof, further suggesting that the impact came from the right side. Therefore, based on the injuries and the description of the collision, it can be concluded that the other vehicle (V2) is primarily responsible for the accident.
