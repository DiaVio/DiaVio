The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one failed to see vehicle two approaching the intersection due to the heavy ground fog, the color of vehicle two blending into the fog, and the fact that vehicle two did not have its lights on. Additionally, vehicle one proceeded to cross the intersection without ensuring it was clear, resulting in the collision with vehicle two.
