V1 ran a red traffic control signal, which is an illegal maneuver and a decision error. This action caused V1 to collide with V2 and subsequently collide with V3. The driver of V1 also refused to be interviewed at the scene, indicating a lack of cooperation. Additionally, the weather conditions, specifically the rain, may have contributed to the accident.
