The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. Additionally, V1's right tires bounced over a driveway with culverts, suggesting that the driver may have been driving at an excessive speed or not paying attention to the road. The impact with the sign post and utility pole further indicates a lack of control and failure to maintain the proper lane.
