The reason for V2's primary responsibility is as follows: - V2 ran a flashing red blinking control, indicating that they should have come to a complete stop at the intersection. However, V2 failed to stop and collided with V1. - The driver of V2 also had a blood alcohol level of .36, which is significantly above the legal limit. This indicates that the driver was impaired at the time of the crash. - Additionally, the driver of V2 had an "unknown recognition error" as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. This suggests that the driver may have been distracted or not paying attention to the road. Overall, V2's failure to stop at the intersection, impaired state, and possible distraction or lack of attention make them primarily responsible for the crash.
