The reason for this is that V1 was turning left from a driveway onto the roadway without ensuring a clear lane. The driver stated that they were "creeping out" of the driveway because they could not see due to the truck in lane one. This indicates a decision error on the part of the driver of V1, as they turned without ensuring that the lane was clear. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other; turning left from driveway," further supporting the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
