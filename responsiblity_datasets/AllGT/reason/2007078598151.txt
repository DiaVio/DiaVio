The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. V1 moved into lane one and struck the back of V2, indicating that V1 did not have enough time or space to stop or avoid the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1's lack of braking was an associated factor in the crash further supports the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible. It is important for drivers to maintain a safe following distance and adjust their speed accordingly to ensure they can react to any sudden changes in traffic conditions. In this case, V1's failure to do so resulted in the collision.
