The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 mph. Witnesses reported that V1 was exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, V1 skidded approximately 4.7 meters before colliding with the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2). This indicates that V1 was unable to stop in time, likely due to their excessive speed. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in lane two, waiting to turn left into a daycare facility. V2's critical reason for the pre-crash event was not coded, indicating that they were not at fault. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 only one second before the impact, suggesting that V1's high speed made it difficult for V2 to anticipate the collision and react in time. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their excessive speed, which prevented them from stopping in time and resulted in the collision with V2.
