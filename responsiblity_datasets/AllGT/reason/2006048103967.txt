The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn into the private driveway, and according to the critical pre-crash event and critical reason coding, the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V1 stated that she sneezed as she was about to make the turn and did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that it was safe to make the left turn.
