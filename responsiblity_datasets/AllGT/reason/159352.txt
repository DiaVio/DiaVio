The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to avoid a deer on the road. This resulted in V1 departing from the road and colliding with a tree. The driver's actions of steering left and then right, which led to the loss of control, indicate that the accident was caused by the driver's response to the deer rather than any external factors.
