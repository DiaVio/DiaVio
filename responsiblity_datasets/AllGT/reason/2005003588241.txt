The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the stop sign. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he stopped for approximately five seconds and looked both directions before proceeding, but the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #2 did not see Vehicle #1 approaching and therefore failed to yield the right of way. Additionally, an associated factor coded to the driver of Vehicle #2 was that he was taking an unidentified prescription medication for high blood pressure. While it is not explicitly stated that this medication impaired his ability to see or react appropriately, it is worth noting as a potential contributing factor to the inadequate surveillance. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and yield the right of way.
