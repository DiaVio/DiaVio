The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that V2 stopped suddenly and he could not avoid hitting him. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking to his passengers, which may have contributed to his inability to react in time to avoid the collision.
