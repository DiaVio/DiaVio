The critical pre-crash event for V2 was "this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection," indicating that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically an "unknown decision error." This suggests that V2 made an error in judgment or decision-making while attempting the left turn. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 driver was operating the vehicle without a valid driver's license. This further indicates a lack of proper qualifications and potentially a lack of experience or knowledge of the rules of the road. While V1, the driver of the 1997 Dodge Stratus, was cited for driving without insurance and operating the vehicle without proper registration, there is no evidence or mention of V1 making any errors or violations directly related to the accident. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the collision.
