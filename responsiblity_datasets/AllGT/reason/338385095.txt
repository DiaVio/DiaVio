The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 crossed the center line while negotiating a left curve, swerved right to avoid a non-contact vehicle, and then crossed left again into the oncoming lane of traffic, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 1 (the 2012 Honda Odyssey minivan). This indicates that Vehicle 2 was not maintaining its lane and was responsible for causing the collision.
