The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was backing out of a residential driveway, which means it had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic on the roadway. Vehicle 1 (2009 Mercury Mountaineer) was traveling in the southbound lane and had the right of way. Vehicle 2's failure to yield resulted in the collision with Vehicle 1.
