The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing the westbound lanes. The driver of V2 stated that she stopped at the stop sign and looked both ways, but did not see anyone coming. However, V1 was approaching in the westbound lane and had the right of way. V2 proceeded to cross the westbound lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V1.
