The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the non-contact vehicle that was stopped in the roadway. The driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with the passenger and took her eyes off the road, resulting in her not noticing the stopped vehicle in front of her until it was too late. This lack of attention and failure to maintain a safe following distance led to V1 exiting the roadway, striking multiple objects, and ultimately causing the accident.
