The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) in an area where the posted speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph) and there was an advisory sign indicating a speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) due to a curve in the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve, which led to the vehicle departing the right roadside initially and then losing control and rolling over after reentering the roadway. Additionally, the driver of V1 was an 18-year-old male who was driving to his girlfriend's house. While not directly stated, it can be inferred that the driver may have been inexperienced or distracted, which could have contributed to his inability to properly negotiate the curve. Furthermore, the presence of a bald tire on the left rear of the vehicle indicates a tire deficiency, which could have further compromised the vehicle's stability and control. Overall, the combination of excessive speed, driver inexperience or distraction, and a tire deficiency all point to V1 being primarily responsible for the accident.
