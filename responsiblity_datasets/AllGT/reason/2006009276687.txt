The reason for V2's responsibility is that the driver slowed down abruptly to avoid being sideswiped by the merging dump truck. This sudden deceleration caused V1, the Toyota Avalon, to strike V2 in the rear. Additionally, V2's loss of control and swerving into lane 4 resulted in a collision with V4, the GMC Jimmy truck. Therefore, V2's actions of slowing down abruptly and losing control contributed to the chain of events leading to the accident.
