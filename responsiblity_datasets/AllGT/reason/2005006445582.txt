The driver of V1 admitted to not fully paying attention and being distracted by conversing with the passenger and listening to the radio. This internal distraction likely caused him to fail to notice that V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Silverado) was decelerating in front of him at the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 was following too closely to the forward vehicle, which is another contributing factor to the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 refused to comment on the crash and did not provide access to his vehicle. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if there were any factors that could have contributed to the accident on the part of V2. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors such as distraction and following too closely.
