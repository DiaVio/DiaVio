The reason for this is that the occupant, an 81-year-old female, was found to not be restrained with a seat belt. This lack of restraint contributed to her movement forward during the first impact and subsequent contact with the instrument panel during the second impact. The injuries sustained by the occupant, including fractures to the facial bones, mandible, and ribs, were likely a result of this unrestrained movement. Therefore, the driver of the vehicle, who failed to ensure that the occupant was properly restrained, bears primary responsibility for the accident.
