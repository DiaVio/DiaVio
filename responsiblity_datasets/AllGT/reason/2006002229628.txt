The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was decelerating to a stop behind Vehicle #1, but failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the back of Vehicle #1. This indicates that Vehicle #2 was not paying sufficient attention to the traffic ahead and did not leave enough space to stop safely. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #2 was "other vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This suggests that Vehicle #2 was aware of the presence of Vehicle #3 behind them, but failed to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, Vehicle #2's failure to maintain a safe distance and react to the traffic ahead makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
