The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and check his blind spot before changing lanes. This resulted in V1 impacting the left rear corner of V2, causing V2 to rotate and collide with the right side wall and then with the front tire area of V1. V1's failure to properly observe the presence of V2 in his blind spot and his inadequate surveillance can be considered as the critical reason for the accident.
