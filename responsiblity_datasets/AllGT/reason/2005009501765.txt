The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and engaged in an argument with her occupant at the time of the crash. This distraction likely contributed to her failure to see V2 (the 1991 Honda Accord Wagon) approaching in lane two. Additionally, V1's view of oncoming traffic was partially blocked by the turning non-contact vehicle (NCV), further hindering her ability to see V2. While V2's driver was not available for an interview, there is no evidence or information suggesting any fault or contributing factors on the part of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
