The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the driver-related factor coded in the critical reason. V1 drove off the road to the right, impacting a fire hydrant, pedestrian walk, and traffic sign before crossing multiple lanes of traffic and ultimately coming to rest beside the fire hydrant it initially impacted. This sequence of events suggests a lack of control over the vehicle's direction, leading to the crash.
