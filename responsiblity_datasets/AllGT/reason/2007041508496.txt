The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 veered to the right and sideswiped the parked vehicle (V2). The driver of V1 stated that she was cut off by another vehicle in lane two, but the critical pre-crash event indicates that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. This suggests that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and made an incorrect evasive action, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver's lack of experience with the rental vehicle may have contributed to the incorrect evasive action.
