The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to negotiate the left turning curve, causing it to travel over the centerline and into the westbound travel lane, ultimately colliding with Vehicle 3 and its trailer. The impact with Vehicle 3 caused Vehicle 2 to ramp up onto its two right side wheels and continue traveling in an easterly direction. As Vehicle 1 was traveling westbound, it was impacted on its left side by the wheels/tires/undercarriage of Vehicle 2, which were in the air at the time of impact. This non-horizontal impact caused significant damage to Vehicle 1 and resulted in the injuries sustained by the driver.
