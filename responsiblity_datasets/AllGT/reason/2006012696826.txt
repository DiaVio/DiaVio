The driver of V1 was distracted by an argument with her sister, which caused her to take her eyes off the road. This distraction led to her failure to notice the stopped vehicle (V2) in front of her in a timely manner. Despite attempting to brake, she was unable to avoid colliding with the rear of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .233, which is well above the legal limit. This impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely and contributed to her inability to react in time to avoid the collision. The driver of V2, on the other hand, was stopped in lane one due to a decision error. She chose to stop on the roadway in the travel lane to talk to a pedestrian, which is a hazardous action. However, this decision alone does not absolve the driver of V1 from responsibility, as the primary cause of the accident was the distracted driving and impaired state of the driver of V1. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to distracted driving, impaired state (high BAC), and failure to maintain proper surveillance of the road ahead.
