The reason for this determination is that V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway and struck multiple trees. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side." The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; unknown critical non-performance." Additionally, the driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .181, which indicates impaired driving. This impairment likely contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the roadway. Therefore, based on the driver's impairment and the fact that V1 traveled off the road and struck trees, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
