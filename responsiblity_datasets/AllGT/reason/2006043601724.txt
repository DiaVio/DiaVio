The driver of V1 overcompensated after initially drifting off the right side of the road, resulting in a left side roadway departure and collision with two small trees. The driver's claim of swerving to avoid a deer is not supported by the evidence at the scene. Additionally, the driver's history of multiple crashes in the past three years, along with the fact that she was operating a rental car and had a vision impairment due to having only one eye, contribute to her responsibility for the accident.
