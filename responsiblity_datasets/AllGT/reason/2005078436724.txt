The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking to his left down a cross street at another truck, which caused him to take his focus off the actions of the vehicles in front of him. This distraction led to V1 failing to notice that V2 (the 2004 Chevrolet Aveo sedan) had slowed down for a vehicle in front of it, resulting in the collision.
