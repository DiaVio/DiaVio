The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a curved, wet road. This is evident from the driver's statement that she was traveling at about 40 kmph (25 mph) in heavy rain as she exited the curved section of road. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, further indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to excessive speed and poor road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust her speed to the wet road conditions and negotiate the curve safely.
