The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 entered the intersection without the right of way, indicating a failure to yield to oncoming traffic. This is supported by the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1, which states that it was "traveling-crossing over (passing through) intersection." On the other hand, Vehicle #2's critical pre-crash event is "other vehicle encroachment-from crossing street across path," suggesting that Vehicle #2 was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to yield and enter the intersection without the right of way makes it primarily responsible for the crash.
