The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a brake failure, which led to a loss of control of the vehicle. The driver stated that she had dropped her husband off at the airport and then visited the gym before the incident occurred. She mentioned that her husband had previously noticed an issue with the brakes and advised her to get the car serviced. However, she did not take any action to address the potential problem. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to address the known brake issue, which ultimately resulted in the loss of control and the subsequent collision with the utility pole, shrub, and tree.
