The driver of V1 was distracted by looking at street signs while searching for a store, which was identified as an external distraction. This distraction likely caused the driver to fail to notice that V2 (the 1995 Ford Bronco) was entering the intersection. As a result, V1 collided with the right side of V2. Although V2 was involved in the collision, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the collision, as the encroachment was caused by V1's failure to yield the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's external distraction, which led to the failure to yield to V2.
