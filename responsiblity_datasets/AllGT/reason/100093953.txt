The driver of V1 was not using the seat belt restraint, which is a violation of traffic laws and safety regulations. This lack of restraint likely contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries. Additionally, V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, crossed the double yellow lines, and struck a wooden utility pole. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to their failure to use seat belt restraint and their loss of control resulting in the collision with the utility pole.
