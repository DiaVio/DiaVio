The reason for V1's responsibility is that it ran off the roadway to the left, swerved right and left, and ultimately slid off the roadway to the left side and rolled over. This indicates a loss of control by the driver of V1. While the exact factors responsible for the loss of control are unknown, it is clear that V1's movements and actions led to the accident.
