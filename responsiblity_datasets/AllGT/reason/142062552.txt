The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to negotiate the right turn in the roadway and continued straight, resulting in a collision with the heavy-duty motorized gate. This indicates a failure to exercise proper control of the vehicle and adhere to the road conditions, ultimately leading to the accident. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 did not appear to be wearing the available manual lap-and-shoulder belt, which further contributes to their responsibility for the accident.
