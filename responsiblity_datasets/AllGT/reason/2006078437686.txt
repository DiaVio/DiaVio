The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over lane line on the left side of the travel lane." This indicates that Vehicle One crossed over into the lane of Vehicle Two (2005 Chevrolet Malibu), resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was attributed to a driver-related factor: "too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others." This suggests that Vehicle One was traveling at a speed that was too fast to be able to stop in time after successfully avoiding the non-contact tractor-trailer. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: traveling in the same direction with higher steady speed." This indicates that Vehicle Two was in its designated lane and was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to crossing over into the lane of Vehicle Two and traveling at a speed that was too fast to respond to unexpected actions.
