The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by the oncoming police vehicle and took her eyes off the road, resulting in her vehicle veering into the parking lane and colliding with V2 (the 1988 Chevrolet 1500 pickup truck with a trailer attached). This distraction and subsequent lane deviation caused the initial collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was driving at a speed of approximately 64 KPH (40 MPH), which is above the posted speed limit of 48 KPH (30 MPH). This aggressive act of speeding further contributed to the severity of the accident. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain control of her vehicle, combined with the aggressive act of speeding, make her primarily responsible for the accident.
