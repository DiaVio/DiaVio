The driver of V1 admitted to not looking at the roadway and being distracted by changing the radio station. This internal distraction caused V1 to fail to notice that V2 (the 2004 Nissan Armada) was stopped ahead in the same lane, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the rear of V2. This initial impact then caused a chain reaction, leading to subsequent impacts between V2, V3 (the 2004 Lincoln Navigator), and V4 (the 1999 Toyota Camry). Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention to the road and the surrounding traffic was the critical reason for the crash.
