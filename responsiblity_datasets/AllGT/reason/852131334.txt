The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it rear-ended the transit bus that was stopped in the southbound lane. V1's front end rode under the back bumper of the bus, indicating that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, the fact that V1 had to be towed from the scene suggests significant damage to the vehicle, further indicating that V1 was at fault for the collision.
