The driver of V1 was distracted by something in her rear-view mirror, causing her to take her eyes off the road. When she looked back, she noticed that V2 (the Subaru Forester) had stopped, and she applied her brakes and steered to avoid a collision. However, she was unable to stop in time and ended up colliding with the rear of V2. The driver of V1 failed to maintain a proper lookout and failed to anticipate the actions of other vehicles on the road. This distraction, combined with the rush hour traffic, contributed to the accident. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in traffic for a red light and was not found to have any critical reason or factor that contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and failure to look far enough ahead.
