The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle #2 (the Toyota Celica). The driver admitted to reaching down for a cigarette lighter and not noticing that Vehicle #2 had slowed down to make a left turn. This distraction, combined with the driver's false assumption that Vehicle #2 would continue to proceed, led to the rear-end collision. Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver had been drinking alcohol, although he passed a field sobriety test. The presence of alcohol may have impaired his judgment and reaction time, contributing to the crash. Furthermore, Vehicle #1's driver was cited for multiple violations, including not driving with due care, having a suspended license, and failing to provide proof of insurance. These violations indicate a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic laws. In contrast, Vehicle #2's driver signaled her intention to turn and even went up one crossover further than intended due to Vehicle #1 tailgating her. This suggests that Vehicle #2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. Overall, Vehicle #1's driver's distraction, failure to maintain a safe distance, and violations of traffic laws make them primarily responsible for the crash.
