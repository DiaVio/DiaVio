The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit, and was also engaging in aggressive driving behavior such as popping wheelies. This aggressive and illegal driving put himself and other motorists at risk. Additionally, V2 was unable to respond to the unexpected action of V1 (the driver of the truck) in a timely manner, indicating poor directional control of his vehicle. Therefore, V2's actions and behavior contributed significantly to the collision.
