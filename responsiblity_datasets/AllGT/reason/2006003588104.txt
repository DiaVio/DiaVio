The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding forward. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason for this event was a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). This indicates that V2 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including V1, before entering the intersection, resulting in the collision.
