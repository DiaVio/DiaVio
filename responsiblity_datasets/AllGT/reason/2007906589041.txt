The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver's admission of experiencing a diabetic seizure/blackout while driving. This critical non-performance error, resulting from a physical impairment of the ability to act, caused V1 to veer off the road and collide with the parked Vehicle 2 (V2). The driver's blackout prevented him from maintaining control of his vehicle and avoiding the collision.
