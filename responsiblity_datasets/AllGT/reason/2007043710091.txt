The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to being distracted by talking to her husband about the houses they had visited earlier in the day. Additionally, she was not familiar with the area and had never driven on that roadway before. The driver's attention was likely diverted, leading to her failure to see V2 approaching from the left. The fact that all four of her tires were underinflated may have also contributed to the crash. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was driving within the speed limit and did not have any critical reasons attributed to his actions that would make him primarily responsible for the crash.
