The reason for this is that the driver of V1 backed out of a parking space and then began to travel forward. V1 traveled up and over the parking strip, impacting a parking block and deflating the front right tire. Despite this, the driver continued to accelerate and subsequently impacted a pole, resulting in minor sideswipe damage. V1 then collided with a building, causing the deployment of multiple airbags and resulting in serious injuries to the driver and the death of the front right passenger who was wearing a seat belt. Additionally, the second-row right side passenger, who was not wearing a seat belt, sustained severe injuries and later died. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V1, including failure to control the vehicle, accelerating after tire damage, and ultimately colliding with a building, indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
