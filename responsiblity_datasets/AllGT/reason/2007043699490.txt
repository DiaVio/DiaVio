The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 admitted to accidentally running a stop sign, which resulted in the collision with Vehicle 1. The driver's inadequate surveillance, as stated in the Critical Reason, indicates that she failed to properly observe the intersection before proceeding, leading to the collision. Additionally, the estimated travel and impact speeds of Vehicle 2 were higher than that of Vehicle 1, suggesting that Vehicle 2 may have been traveling at a higher speed, which could have contributed to the severity of the accident. It is important to note that both drivers were teenagers and may have had limited driving experience, which could have influenced their actions and decision-making during the incident. However, based on the information provided, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 2.
