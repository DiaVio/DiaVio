The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and came to rest blocking both lanes of travel. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle in the given road and weather conditions, which included a slick road surface due to moderate snowfall and below freezing temperatures. The driver's statement that he was slowing down for the crash ahead suggests that he may have been traveling too fast for the conditions, leading to the loss of control.
