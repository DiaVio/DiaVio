The driver of V1 was engaged in reckless driving behavior, specifically racing another vehicle at speeds over 100 mph. This aggressive driving behavior led to the loss of control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 driving up on the concrete median and causing significant damage to the plastic dividers. The driver's inexperience, being only 16 years old and having been driving for only 11 months, also contributed to the crash.
