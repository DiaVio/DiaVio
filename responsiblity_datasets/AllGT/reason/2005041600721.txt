The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by conversing on his cell phone while driving. This distraction caused him to fail to notice the abrupt stop of the vehicle in front of him, resulting in him swerving off the roadway onto the painted gore. This sudden maneuver led to Vehicle #2 following suit and colliding with the back right bumper of Vehicle #1. While Vehicle #2 did contribute to the crash by incorrectly following Vehicle #1's evasive action, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle.
