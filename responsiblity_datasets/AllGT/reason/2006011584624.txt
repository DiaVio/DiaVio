The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which is a driver-related decision error. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the road, which may have contributed to her inability to navigate the curve and merge onto the collector lane safely. The improperly inflated tires and worn tread on V1 also played a role in the crash, indicating a vehicle deficiency. Overall, V1's driver's decision to travel at an unsafe speed for the wet conditions, combined with her unfamiliarity with the road and the vehicle's tire deficiencies, led to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
