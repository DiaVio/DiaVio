The driver of V1 stated that he saw the non-contact vehicle with its right turn signal on, indicating that it was going to turn right into the street he was exiting. However, he proceeded to turn left without adequately surveilling the intersection and without seeing V2 approaching in lane two. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that he never saw V1 and was not aware of its presence until it suddenly impacted his car's right side. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident as he was not given sufficient time or opportunity to react to V1's actions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
