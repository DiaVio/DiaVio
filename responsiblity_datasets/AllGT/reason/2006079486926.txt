The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was not paying attention to the driving task and was engaged in a conversation with her children in the back seats. This resulted in a driver-related recognition error and inattention, causing her to fail to notice that V2 had come to a stop in front of her. As a result, V1 collided with the back of V2, which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her led to the chain reaction collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
