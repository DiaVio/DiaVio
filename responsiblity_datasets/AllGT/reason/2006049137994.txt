The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed in the exit lane, which indicates that they were not driving at a safe speed for the conditions. - V1 lost control of the vehicle and began skidding, indicating a lack of control and potentially aggressive driving behavior. - V1 entered the intersecting roadway on the wrong side, crossing three lanes of travel, which shows a failure to yield to oncoming traffic. - V1's vehicle impacted the front and side of V2, indicating that V1 was not able to avoid the collision. Overall, V1's actions of speeding, losing control, and entering the intersecting roadway on the wrong side demonstrate a clear disregard for traffic laws and safe driving practices, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
