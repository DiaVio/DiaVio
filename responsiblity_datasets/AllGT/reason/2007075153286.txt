The reason for this is that the driver was traveling over the posted speed limit, which is indicated by the investigating officer. Additionally, the driver stated that her tires were bald and her speedometer did not work in the vehicle at the time. These factors contribute to the driver's inability to safely navigate the curve, resulting in the vehicle rotating clockwise and ultimately leaving the roadway. The driver's excessive speed and lack of proper equipment (bald tires and malfunctioning speedometer) indicate a failure to exercise due care and caution while driving, making her primarily responsible for the crash.
