The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one made a false assumption of the actions of other drivers. Despite not having a green arrow, the driver assumed she could proceed because the opposing traffic was stopped. This false assumption led to her turning left at the intersection without properly assessing the situation. As a result, vehicle two (the 2004 Mitsubishi Galant) collided with the right side of vehicle one. While vehicle two was encroaching over the left lane line, the critical reason for the pre-crash event of vehicle two was not attributed to this vehicle. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with vehicle one due to the driver's false assumption and failure to yield the right of way.
