The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane." This indicates that V1 was changing lanes to the right and encroached into the lane of V2 (the driver of the Dodge Stratus). V1's failure to properly check for other vehicles and safely change lanes resulted in the collision. While V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction) - over left lane line," the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. This suggests that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly change lanes and check for other vehicles makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
