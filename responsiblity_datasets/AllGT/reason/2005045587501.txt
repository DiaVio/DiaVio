The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by reaching over to get fast food from a bag while driving. This internal distraction caused the driver to initially edge off the right side of the road. Additionally, the driver overcompensated when trying to regain control, which led to the vehicle crossing into the eastbound lane and ultimately crashing into a curve warning sign and a tree. Furthermore, the driver was traveling at a speed higher than the posted speed limit and the advisory speed for the curve. This excessive speed for the road conditions contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction, overcompensation, and excessive speed, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
