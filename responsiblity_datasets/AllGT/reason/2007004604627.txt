The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn in front of V2 (the 1995 Chevrolet Lumina) without yielding the right of way. This action violated the traffic rules and resulted in a collision with V2, which was traveling straight in the southbound lane. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's driver reported not remembering the details of the crash, and an associated factor coded to this driver was the use of prescription medication for diabetes and heart disease. While the exact influence of the medication on the driver's actions is not specified, it suggests a potential impairment or lack of awareness that could have contributed to the driver's failure to yield. On the other hand, V2's driver attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes, indicating a reasonable response to the sudden turn by V1. Therefore, V2's driver cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
