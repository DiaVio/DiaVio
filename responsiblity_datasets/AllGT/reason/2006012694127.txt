The driver of V2 was backing out of a driveway and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the southbound lane. V2 assumed that she had enough time to complete the maneuver based on the school zone speed limit, but this assumption was incorrect. Additionally, the driver of V2 was fatigued and dealing with several family issues, which may have contributed to her lack of attention and judgment in this situation. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and lack of attention make her primarily responsible for the crash.
