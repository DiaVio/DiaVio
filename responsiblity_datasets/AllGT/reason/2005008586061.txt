The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and looking at his wife while speaking to her. This distraction caused Vehicle 1 to drift to the left and collide with the parked Vehicle 2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe). The driver's admission of being distracted indicates that his inattentiveness was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. Additionally, the driver mentioned that he was uncertain if the condition of his vehicle's brakes contributed to the crash, suggesting that the primary cause was his distraction rather than any mechanical issue.
