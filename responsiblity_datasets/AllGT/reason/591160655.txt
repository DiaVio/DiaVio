The driver of V1 was traveling northbound and attempted to make a left turn across the southbound lanes, merging into the center left-turn lane. However, she misjudged the timing and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2007 BMW 328i, which was traveling southbound in the number-one lane. As a result, V1 crossed into the path of V2, resulting in a head-on, frontal-offset collision. The driver of V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the timing for the left turn maneuver led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
