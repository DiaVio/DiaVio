The reason for V1's responsibility is that she made a left turn in front of V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) without ensuring that she had enough clearance. V1 stated that she inched out into the intersection to see around another vehicle that was also turning left, but she failed to notice V2 approaching in lane three. This indicates a driver error on V1's part, as she did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the police on the scene noted that this particular intersection had a history of numerous crashes, suggesting that drivers should exercise extra caution when making turns at this location. However, this does not absolve V1 of her responsibility in this specific incident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn.
