The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance and inattentiveness. The driver of V1 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making a left turn at the intersection. This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the situation led to the collision with V2 (the 2005 Honda Civic). Additionally, V1's front right corner made contact with the front of V2, indicating that V1 was attempting to turn left across the path of oncoming traffic, which further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that V2's driver falsely assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, but this does not absolve V1 of its primary responsibility for the accident.
