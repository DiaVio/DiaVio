The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking down to her right to go through her CD collection, which caused her vehicle to drift to the right and depart the road. This internal distraction led to poor directional control and ultimately resulted in the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted that she was not as familiar with the road, which may have contributed to her inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
