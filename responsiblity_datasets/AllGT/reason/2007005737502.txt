The reason for this is that V1, the Chrysler PT Cruiser, drifted over the left edge of the roadway and made contact with various objects before coming to a rest. The driver of V1 experienced a black-out, most likely due to a heart attack or other physical impairment, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's diabetic condition and lack of food intake may have contributed to his physical impairment.
