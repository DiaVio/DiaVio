The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the right side, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, the driver's actions following the impact with Vehicle #2 suggest that he was conscious and aware of his actions. The witness statement also indicates that the driver was distracted, looking down and to his right before the crash. Furthermore, the driver of Vehicle #1 had a BAC of .358, which is considered acute alcohol intoxication. This, along with the driver's history of seizure disorder and the fact that he was taking multiple medications for it, indicates that alcohol use, prescription drug use, and the seizure disorder were associated factors in the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control, potential distraction, and impaired state caused by alcohol intoxication and medication use.
