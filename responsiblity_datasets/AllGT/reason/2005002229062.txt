The reason for this is the poor directional control of the driver of Vehicle #1, as stated in the Critical Reason for the Critical Event. The driver admitted to moving to the right but believed he was over too far, indicating a lack of proper judgment and control while negotiating the curve. Additionally, the driver's use of prescription medications, which may have side effects such as drowsiness and tiredness, could have impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle.
