The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 crossed into the eastbound lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. - V1 then overcompensated by correcting to the right across the westbound lane, which led to the vehicle rotating clockwise and going off the north shoulder of the roadway. - The driver's statement of dozing off suggests fatigue, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. - The driver's admission of having one drink and a few beers before stopping drinking at 3 a.m. raises the possibility of impaired judgment and reaction time. Overall, V1's driver exhibited multiple errors, including failure to maintain lane position, overcompensation, and potential impairment due to fatigue and alcohol consumption. These factors indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
