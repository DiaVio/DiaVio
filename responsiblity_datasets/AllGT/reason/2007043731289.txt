The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by his girlfriend reaching into the center console, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. This distraction led to V1 driving off the left side of the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree. The police reported travel speed of 80 kmph for V1 also suggests that the driver was likely exceeding the posted speed limit, which further contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and poor directional control, combined with potentially speeding, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
