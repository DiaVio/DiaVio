The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. This driver error of inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2 (the Chevrolet Silverado). Additionally, a witness stated that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, further supporting V1's responsibility for the accident.
