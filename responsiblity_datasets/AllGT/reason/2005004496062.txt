The driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2 and did not take any avoidance actions. This indicates a driver recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling at a relatively low speed (between 11-20 MPH) at the time of impact, while V2 was traveling at a higher speed (between 41-50 MPH). V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and properly assess the situation led to the collision.
