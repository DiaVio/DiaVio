The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons, resulting in the vehicle going off the roadway and overturning in a ditch. Additionally, the driver fled the scene on foot, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. Without further information or an interview with the driver, it is difficult to determine the exact reason for the loss of control. However, the fact that the crash occurred on an icy roadway suggests that the driver may have been driving too fast for the conditions, failed to adjust their driving behavior accordingly, and ultimately lost control of the vehicle.
