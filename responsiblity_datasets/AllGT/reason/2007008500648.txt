The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy and snow-covered road conditions. This is evident from the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event, which states that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions and was traveling at a speed that was not safe for the conditions. Additionally, the driver's attempt to proceed at a safe speed for the conditions indicates that they were aware of the road conditions but failed to adjust their speed accordingly. On the other hand, V2 (the 2006 GMC Yukon) was encroached upon by V1, which was traveling in the adjacent lane. However, V2's Critical Reason was not coded, indicating that there was no driver-related factor that contributed to the crash. The only associated factors for V2 were the poor road conditions and the rush hour traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed for the icy and snow-covered road conditions.
