The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was attempting to make a left turn from the left turn only lane, but instead of completing the turn successfully, it departed the roadway to the right and collided with the steel support cable of a utility pole. This indicates that V1 failed to properly navigate the turn, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's attire and the presence of groceries suggest that she may have been distracted or not fully focused on the task of driving.
