The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical pre-crash event. The driver's irregular sleep patterns, combined with the use of medications for depression and high cholesterol, likely contributed to his drowsiness. The driver's son had expressed concern about his father's ability to drive, but the driver declined alternative transportation options. The driver's sleepiness caused him to veer off the left side of the road, and although he was briefly awakened by the rumble strip, he was unable to regain control of the vehicle, leading to the subsequent rollover and fatal injuries.
