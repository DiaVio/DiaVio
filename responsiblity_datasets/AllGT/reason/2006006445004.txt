The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to making a false assumption about the actions of the driver of V2 (the Dodge Ram 2500 cargo van). V1 stated that she assumed V2 would run the changing traffic light and decided to "run the light" herself. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with following too closely and tailgating, led to V1 colliding with the rear of V2. Additionally, V2's driver stated that he came to a complete and controlled stop when the traffic light turned yellow, indicating that he was following the appropriate traffic rules and taking extra care on the dangerous roadway. No associated factors were coded to V2's driver, indicating that he was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her false assumption, aggressive driving behavior, and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
