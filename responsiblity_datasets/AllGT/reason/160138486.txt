The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it initially went off the south side of the roadway while negotiating the curve. This indicates that V1 was not properly maintaining its lane and control of the vehicle. Additionally, when V1 steered to the right to correct, it resulted in a counterclockwise yaw, causing V1 to cross the centerline and collide with the front of Vehicle two (V2). This suggests that V1's actions directly led to the collision with V2.
