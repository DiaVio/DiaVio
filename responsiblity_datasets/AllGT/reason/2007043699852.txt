The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver suffered a stroke, resulting in a physical impairment of the ability to act. This impairment led to a loss of consciousness, causing V1 to veer off the road and collide with an embankment and concrete drainage pipe. The driver's medical condition and subsequent loss of consciousness indicate that V1's driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
