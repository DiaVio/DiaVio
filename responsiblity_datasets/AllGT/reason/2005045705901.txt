The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, resulting in the vehicle departing the right side of the road and colliding with the concrete wall. This critical non-performance error of sleeping while driving led to the subsequent loss of control and the vehicle crossing all three lanes of traffic before striking the median wall. The driver's unreliable interview, false information provided to the police, and the fact that he was charged with no driver's license in possession and failure to maintain control of the vehicle further support V1's responsibility. Contributing factors such as fatigue from driving 7.5 hours with little or no sleep, rain, and wet road conditions also played a role in the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's critical non-performance error of falling asleep while driving.
