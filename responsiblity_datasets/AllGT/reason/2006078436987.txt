The reason for this is that V2 was passing V1 in the eastbound lane and then entered the westbound lane, stopping suddenly without any apparent reason. This sudden stop created a hazardous situation for V1, who was traveling at a higher speed and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. Additionally, V2 left the scene of the accident, which further indicates a lack of responsibility and accountability. In summary, V2's actions of passing in the wrong lane, sudden stop, and leaving the scene make them primarily responsible for the accident.
