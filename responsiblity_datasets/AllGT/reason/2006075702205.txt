The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and using a cell phone to get directions while driving. This internal distraction caused him to be unaware of his surroundings and the approaching vehicle (V2). Additionally, the driver admitted to being lost, frustrated, and in a hurry, which likely contributed to his lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic at the stop sign-controlled intersection.
