The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that she looked both ways but never saw the other vehicle (V2). This indicates that she failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic before initiating the left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 is described as an inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to her failure to adequately surveil the intersection.
