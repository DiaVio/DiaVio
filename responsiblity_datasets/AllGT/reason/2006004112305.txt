The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by an object he had just run over and was looking in his rearview mirror. As a result, he failed to notice the cars in front of him slowing down and did not have enough time to avoid colliding with V2 (the 2003 Honda Element).
