The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as a driver-related factor: internal distraction. Additionally, V2 crossed the intersection with an obstructed view due to the presence of the tree and parked vehicles. These factors contributed to V2's failure to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
