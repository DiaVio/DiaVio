The reason for V1's responsibility is that it lost control on a large ice patch that spanned over both lanes of traffic. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle in the presence of the icy road conditions. Additionally, V1's overcorrection and subsequent rotation counterclockwise further contributed to the accident. While the road conditions were poor due to the ice patch, it is the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety. In this case, V1 failed to do so, resulting in the accident.
