The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn at the intersection without adequately surveilling the approaching traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 2002 Honda Accord). V1's failure to observe V2's approach and execute the left turn safely led to the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that V2's false assumption that V1 would not execute the left turn while she passed through the intersection is an associative factor but does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2's actions were influenced by her assumption, but the primary cause of the collision lies with V1's inadequate surveillance and recognition error.
