The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 pulled forward and into the path of V2 (the 1989 Toyota Xtracab pickup) without adequately surveilling the road. This is indicated by the critical pre-crash event for V1, which states that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason for this event is attributed to V1's inadequate surveillance, meaning that the driver of V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see V2 approaching. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and pulling into the path of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
