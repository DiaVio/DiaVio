The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 ran a red traffic control signal and collided with V1, which had the right of way. V2's driver admitted to being distracted and looking down to reach for a lighter, resulting in a recognition error. The driver's emotional state and fatigue may have also contributed to the distraction. Additionally, V2 was traveling between 50 and 64 KMPH (31 and 40 MPH), which indicates that V2 was exceeding the posted speed limit for the northbound lane. Therefore, V2's failure to obey the traffic signal, distracted driving, and potential speeding make them primarily responsible for the accident.
