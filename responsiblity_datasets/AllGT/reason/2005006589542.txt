The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed slightly over the posted speed limit on a wet and slippery cobblestone road. She attempted to avoid contact with another vehicle by turning to the right while negotiating a curve, but lost control of the vehicle and collided with a pole and a wall. The critical pre-crash event was coded as control loss due to rain and wet cobblestone, indicating that the driver's decision to drive too fast on the wet road surface was a contributing factor to the crash.
