The reason for this is that V2 failed to decelerate accordingly and struck the rear of V1 as it began turning left. This indicates that V2 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the slowing of V1. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V2 was coded as an unknown driver type error, suggesting that the driver of V2 made an error that contributed to the crash. V1, the unknown vehicle, cannot be held primarily responsible as it was slowing down to make a left turn, which is a normal and expected maneuver. V3, the 1989 Toyota Pickup, is not involved in the first harmful event and therefore cannot be held primarily responsible either.
