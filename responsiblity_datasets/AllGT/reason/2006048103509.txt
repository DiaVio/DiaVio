The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver admitted to falling asleep and being asleep at the time of the crash. This indicates a clear driver-related factor that directly contributed to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road and striking a tree. The fact that the driver has narcolepsy and a seizure disorder, but takes no medication, further supports the driver's responsibility for the accident.
