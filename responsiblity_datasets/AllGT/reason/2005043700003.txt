The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the 1996 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup) was traveling straight through the intersection in the appropriate lane. V1 turned in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the medical report for V1 indicated positive lab results for both cocaine and marijuana, suggesting potential impairment at the time of the crash. However, since V1 was unable to be interviewed, further details regarding the influence of drugs on the crash are not available.
