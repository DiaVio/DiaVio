The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons, resulting in the vehicle traveling off the road and colliding with both a metal guardrail and a concrete barrier. The driver's loss of control ultimately led to the crash and subsequent injuries.
