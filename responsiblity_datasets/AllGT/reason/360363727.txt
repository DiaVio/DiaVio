The reason for this is that V1's driver, a 22-year-old male, lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve. The driver traveled into the eastbound lane, overcorrected, and began to go into a clockwise yaw. This resulted in V1 crossing over the westbound lane, traveling up and over the curb, and impacting a concrete block retaining wall. The driver's loss of control and subsequent collision with the wall caused the vehicle to rollover and come to a rest on its top. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the resulting sequence of events, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
