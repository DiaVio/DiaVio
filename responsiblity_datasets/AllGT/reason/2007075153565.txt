The driver of V1 was following V2 (the driver of the 1994 Dodge Dakota) too closely, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as "following too closely to respond to unexpected actions." Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and blowing snow. These factors contributed to V1's inability to slow down and steer left to avoid contacting V2, resulting in the collision between V1 and V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and adjust their speed to the road conditions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
