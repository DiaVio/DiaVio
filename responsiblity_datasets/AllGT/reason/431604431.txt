The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was initially eastbound on the inboard left turn lane and entered the intersection to make a left turn, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2009 Hyundai Sonata) which was proceeding straight in the westbound outboard through lane. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
