The reason for this is that V2 drifted off the roadway into the median, causing the driver to overcorrect and steer right in an attempt to get back into the travel lane. However, the driver of V2 overcorrected a second time, steering left and crossing the median's crossover area while rotating counterclockwise. This resulted in V2 entering the travel lane of V1 (the 2008 Ford Mustang) and causing the collision.
