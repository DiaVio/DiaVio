The reason for this is that V2 ran a red light by disregarding the flashing lights at the intersection. The investigating officer spoke with a public works employee who confirmed that the lights were initially flashing red and were then switched back to alternating red, amber, green. Immediately after the lights were switched, the crash occurred. This indicates that V2 failed to obey the traffic signal and proceeded into the intersection when it was not their right of way.
