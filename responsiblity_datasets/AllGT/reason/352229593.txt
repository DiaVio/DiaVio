The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 drifted slightly off the right edge of the roadway while negotiating a left turning curve. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. The driver then over-steered left, causing the vehicle to depart the left side of the roadway and collide with a tree. This suggests a lack of attentiveness and an improper response to the initial drift. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 bears primary responsibility for the accident.
