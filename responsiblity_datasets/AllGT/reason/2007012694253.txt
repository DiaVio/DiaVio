The driver of V1 failed to stop and check traffic before pulling out of the parking lot, which resulted in the collision with Vehicle #2 (V2). The witness accounts confirm that V1 did not stop or look to the left before entering the roadway. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, as he did not have a license and had never taken driver's training. The associated factors coded to the driver of V1, such as inadequate surveillance, fatigue, conversation with the passenger, and unfamiliarity with the roadway and vehicle, further support the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
