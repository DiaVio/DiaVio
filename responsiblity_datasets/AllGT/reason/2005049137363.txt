The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to pass through the intersection against the red light to turn left, which is an illegal maneuver and a disregard of the traffic control signal. This action directly led to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 fled the scene, further indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
