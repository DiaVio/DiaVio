The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 64 kmph (significantly above the posted speed limit of 40 kmph) on a road with snow on the edges and ice patches. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.23, which is well above the legal limit. These factors indicate that V1 was not driving in a safe and responsible manner, leading to the loss of control of the vehicle and subsequent collision with multiple objects.
