The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 was traveling at approximately 64 kmph (40 mph) and failed to recognize that V2 (the 1999 Dodge Durango SUV) was stopped in front of them. V1 then collided with the back end of V2, causing the accident. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicle in their lane. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle and maintain a safe distance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
