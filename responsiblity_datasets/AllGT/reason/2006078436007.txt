The driver of V-1 made a false assumption of the actions of other vehicles, specifically assuming that V-2 (the driver of the 1982 Chevrolet S-10) would stop for the yellow light. This false assumption led to V-1 making a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V-2.
