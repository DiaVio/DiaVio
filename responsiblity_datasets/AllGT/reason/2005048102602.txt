The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 departed the road and impacted the curb with its right front tire, indicating poor directional control. - V1 struck a timber power pole and a wooden privacy fence, suggesting a lack of control over the vehicle. - The skid marks indicate that V1 tracked off the roadway, further supporting the driver's poor directional control. - The front tires of V1 have very low tread depths, which could have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and potential vehicle maintenance issues.
