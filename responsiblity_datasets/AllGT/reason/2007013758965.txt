The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver stated that the trailer he was pulling started to fishtail, leading to a jack-knife event. This indicates that there was a loss of control of the vehicle and trailer, which ultimately caused V1 to depart the roadway and roll over. The driver's statement of hitting the brakes hard suggests a possible overreaction or improper response to the fishtailing, which may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the vehicle-related jack-knife event and the driver's actions in response to it.
