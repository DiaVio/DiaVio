The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. Despite stopping for a brief moment, V1 did not see V2 approaching from the right and accelerated through the intersection without ensuring it was clear. This lack of proper surveillance and failure to see the oncoming vehicle led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was in a hurry and late for school, which could have contributed to their impatience and lack of attention at the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to properly survey the intersection and their impatience make them primarily responsible for the accident.
