The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was "other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line." This indicates that a non-contact vehicle changed lanes in front of Vehicle One, causing the driver to steer left to avoid a collision. However, the driver of Vehicle One overcompensated, resulting in the vehicle traveling off the left side of the roadway and ultimately colliding with the concrete barrier. The debris from Vehicle One then struck the front of Vehicle Two. While Vehicle Two (2002 Subaru Impreza) was involved in the crash, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was "other: not involved first harmful event," indicating that Vehicle Two was not directly responsible for the initial collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation after encountering the non-contact vehicle encroaching into their lane.
