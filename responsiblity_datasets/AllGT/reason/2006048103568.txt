The reason for this is that V1 was turning left into the driveway, crossing into the path of V2 (the driver of the 1994 Ford Tempo) who was traveling in the opposite direction. V1's inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, suggests that they failed to properly look or failed to see V2 approaching. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and their inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
