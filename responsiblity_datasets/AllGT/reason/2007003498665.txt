The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated to the police that he was attempting to avoid a non-contact vehicle when he lost control and impacted V2 and V3. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "too fast for curve/turn". This indicates that the driver of V1 was driving at a speed that was too fast for the curve, resulting in the loss of control and subsequent collision with V2 and V3.
