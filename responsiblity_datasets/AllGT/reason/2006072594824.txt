The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Dodge Grand Caravan) while making a left turn at the intersection. V1 assumed that V2 would stop on a yellow light, but this assumption was false. V1's false assumption of the other driver's actions led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was distracted by talking to her passenger and listening to the radio prior to the collision, which further contributed to her failure to yield the right of way.
