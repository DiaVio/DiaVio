The critical precrash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle turning left at the intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. V2, on the other hand, was driving within the speed limit and had the right of way with a green light. The driver reported that there was traffic to his left that blocked his sightline of V1 before he entered the intersection, suggesting that V2 had limited visibility of V1's actions. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
