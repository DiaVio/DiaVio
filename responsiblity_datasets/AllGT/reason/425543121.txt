The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the road surface and entered the grass median while negotiating a right curve. This action caused Vehicle 1 to collide with a steel guardrail end terminal, resulting in the guardrail folding into a point. Vehicle 1 then continued rotating clockwise and the folded guardrail point penetrated through the vehicle, causing severe injuries to the driver and the right front occupant. The momentum of Vehicle 1 while impaled on the guardrail also caused it to swing around counter-clockwise and impact the face of the guardrail. Therefore, Vehicle 1's departure from the road surface and subsequent collision with the guardrail end terminal led to the multi-event collision and the critical injuries sustained by the occupants.
