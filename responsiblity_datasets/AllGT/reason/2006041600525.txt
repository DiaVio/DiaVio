The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of the Nissan Maxima ran through a red light, as witnessed by both the driver of V2 (the 2006 Mercedes E-350) and a witness at the scene. This action directly caused the collision with V2, as V2 had the right of way after waiting for the green light to make a left turn. Despite the driver of V2 honking and attempting to avoid the impact, V1 continued through the intersection, indicating a failure to obey traffic signals and a lack of attention to the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to running a red light and failing to yield to the right of way.
