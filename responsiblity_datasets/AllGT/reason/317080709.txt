The reason for this is that V1 slid on the wet roadway and traveled across the left lane, ultimately striking the concrete barrier with its front left corner. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, potentially due to driving too fast for the wet conditions or not adjusting their driving behavior to account for the rain. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent it from sliding and colliding with the barrier suggests negligence or a failure to exercise reasonable care while driving.
