The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop or yield at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. This failure to stop or yield resulted in V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2, who had the right of way. V1's own statement confirms that he proceeded through the intersection without properly checking for oncoming traffic, leading to the collision.
