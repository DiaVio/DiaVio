The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it failed to recognize the presence of V2 (the 1999 Ford Escort) stopped in lane two. The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was "other motor vehicle stopped in travel lane," indicating that V1 should have been able to see and react to the stopped vehicle ahead. The Critical Reason for V1 was coded as "unknown recognition error," suggesting that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the presence of the stopped vehicle in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the associated factor of sun glare may have contributed to the driver of V1 not being able to see the stopped vehicle clearly. However, it is important to note that driver inexperience was also coded as an associated factor for V1, as the driver had only been driving for 5 weeks. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to a failure to recognize the stopped vehicle ahead, possibly exacerbated by sun glare and driver inexperience.
