The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 82 mph, which is in excess of the posted speed limit. Additionally, the data recovered from the vehicle shows that V1's tires were slightly under-inflated. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not adhering to the speed limit and did not properly maintain the vehicle's tires, both of which contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Furthermore, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related performance error, specifically overcompensation. This suggests that the driver of V1 overreacted to the non-contact vehicle moving into their lane, resulting in a loss of traction and the subsequent crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, failure to properly maintain the vehicle's tires, and overcompensation when faced with a potential collision with the non-contact vehicle.
