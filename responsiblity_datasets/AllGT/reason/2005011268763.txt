The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle. V1 braked hard and swerved right to avoid the non-contact vehicle, but ultimately drove off the road and into a ditch. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to adjust its speed accordingly to safely navigate the situation.
