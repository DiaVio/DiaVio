The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was changing lanes in the intersection without adequate surveillance. The driver claimed that his view of oncoming traffic was obstructed by a building on his right side, and he was also conversing with the other occupants of the vehicle. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2, causing the accident.
