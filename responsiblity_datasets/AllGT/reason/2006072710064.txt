This suggests that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the departure from the roadway and subsequent collision with the concrete wall. As the driver of Vehicle one, it is their responsibility to ensure that their vehicle is in proper working condition and that they are able to safely navigate the road.
