The driver of V1 reported that an unknown vehicle "cut her off" in lane 4, causing her to jerk the wheel and collide with V2. This sudden movement and improper evasive action by V1 resulted in the collision. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 89 kmph, which indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or driving with sufficient caution given the congested and sun-glare conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of her vehicle and the improper evasive action taken are the main reasons for the accident.
