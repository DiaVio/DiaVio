The driver of Vehicle #1 initiated an illegal U-turn from the right westbound lane without stopping, causing the collision with Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 had a blood alcohol level above the legal limit and had amphetamines in his system at the time of the crash. These factors indicate impaired driving and further contribute to the driver's responsibility for the accident.
