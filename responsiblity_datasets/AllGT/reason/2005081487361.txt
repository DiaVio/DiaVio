The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions and failed to look far enough ahead. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and did not adjust their speed accordingly to the heavy traffic congestion and road construction in the area. As a result, V1 collided with the rear of V2, initiating the chain reaction of collisions involving V3 and V4.
