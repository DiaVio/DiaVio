The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to daydreaming and not realizing that he was drifting left. This driver-related recognition error, combined with his inexperience as a fairly new licensed driver, led to the loss of control of the vehicle and subsequent collision with the raised median and concrete barrier. The driver's lack of attention and failure to maintain proper lane position ultimately caused the crash.
