The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The Critical Reason coded for V2 was inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V1). Additionally, V2 reported that a previous vision impairment caused by a detached retina may have made it difficult for her to see the oncoming vehicle. While V1 was reported to be speeding and did not have his headlights on, V2's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn is the primary factor contributing to the crash.
