The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite having a green arrow, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the intersection is clear before proceeding. In this case, V2 accelerated into the intersection without looking for oncoming traffic, resulting in a collision with V1. While V1, the driver of the Nissan Altima, was distracted and failed to stop for the traffic control device, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for not properly surveilling the intersection before making the left turn.
