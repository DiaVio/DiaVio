The reason for this is that V1 either did not stop at the stop sign or stopped and then entered the intersection at a low speed. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he blacks out every four months and believes he blacked out in the intersection. This indicates a physical impairment of the ability to act, which likely contributed to the crash.
