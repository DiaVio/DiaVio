The driver of V2 was attempting to merge into lane one from the parking lane without adequately surveilling the road. The driver admitted to not looking in his mirror before pulling out, which resulted in him not seeing V1, the Mercedes-Benz ML320, until the collision occurred. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the accident.
