The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 drifted off the right side of the road and struck a couch that was positioned off the right side of the roadway. Despite noticing the couch and making a conscious effort to avoid it, the driver still headed towards it and struck it. This indicates a lack of proper directional control, which was a contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, the Critical Reason coded for V1 was external distraction, suggesting that the driver may have been distracted by something outside the vehicle, further impairing their ability to maintain control and avoid the collision.
