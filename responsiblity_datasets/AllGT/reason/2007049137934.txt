The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to turn left into the private driveway, which requires yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not see V2 approaching in the opposite direction. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield resulted in the front of V1 colliding with the front of V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2002 Mitsubishi Eclipse) was driving in the correct lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. V2 only realized that V1 was not going to yield the right-of-way shortly before the impact and attempted to brake and steer to the right to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
