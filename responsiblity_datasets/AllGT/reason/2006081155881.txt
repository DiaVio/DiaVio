The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway via the right shoulder and collided with a power pole without taking any avoidance actions. The shallow roadway departure angle and the vehicle's trajectory after the impact suggest that the driver may have fallen asleep or taken their eyes off the road. Since there is no information available about the driver's actions or condition, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the driver error. However, the lack of any environmental or vehicle factors contributing to the collision indicates that the primary responsibility lies with V1.
