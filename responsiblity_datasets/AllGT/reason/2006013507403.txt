The driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2 approaching from the south, indicating inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe the intersection before making a left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted that his foot slipped off the clutch pedal, which may have contributed to his failure to see V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and potential driver error.
