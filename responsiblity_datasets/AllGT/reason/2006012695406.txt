The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately check for other vehicles before changing lanes and making a right turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that he looked to the right and saw no one behind him, but did not see V2 in the adjacent lane. The driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 resulted in the collision. Additionally, the damage to the left front of V1 from a previous crash suggests a possible lack of attention or awareness on the part of the driver.
