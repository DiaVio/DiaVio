The reason for V1's responsibility is that they turned left at the intersection when the traffic light was red. This action violated the traffic signal and resulted in V2, who was traveling at a constant velocity in the northbound lane, colliding with V1. V1's failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic caused the accident.
