The reason for this is that V1 was traveling west and negotiating a right curve when it crossed the center line and went off the left side of the road. It then traveled across residential yards and struck a tree, causing significant damage and injury to the unbelted driver. The fact that the driver was unbelted and the retractor pretensioner locked the belt into the unused position further indicates negligence on the part of the driver.
