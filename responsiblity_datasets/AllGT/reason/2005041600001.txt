The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 attempted to make a left turn without giving Vehicle #2 the right of way. Despite having a green light, Vehicle #1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was found to have a blood alcohol concentration almost twice the legal limit, which may have impaired her judgment and contributed to the decision error of misjudging the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2. The driver's age and the possible side effects of her medication for hypertension, such as dizziness and fatigue, could have also played a role in the misjudgment.
