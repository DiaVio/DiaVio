Reason: V1, driven by an unlicensed 16-year-old driver with no driver's education, made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix). V1 proceeded to make a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so, disregarding the presence of V2 in lane one. This decision error and false assumption of other action led to the collision.
