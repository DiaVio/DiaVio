The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 admitted to "creeping out" to see if the coast was clear before making a left turn. However, he failed to see Vehicle 2 (V2) approaching from his left and proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in the collision. The driver's claim of obscured sightline to his right side does not absolve him of responsibility, as he still had a duty to ensure that it was safe to proceed with the left turn. Additionally, the fact that V1's speed was only 8 kmph (5 mph) indicates that he was not traveling at a high speed, further suggesting that he had ample time to observe and react to the approaching V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance.
