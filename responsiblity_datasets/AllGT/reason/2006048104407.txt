The critical reason for V1's responsibility is the "illegal maneuver" of failing to stop for the traffic control device (traffic signal). V1 was traveling eastbound and entered the intersection without stopping, resulting in the front of V1 contacting the right side of V2 (the 2004 Toyota Four-Runner). This illegal maneuver by V1 caused the collision and subsequent rotation of V1.
