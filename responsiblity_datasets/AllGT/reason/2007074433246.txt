The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver's focus on the non-contact vehicle in front of her contributed to her inadequate surveillance. This means that V1 did not properly look or failed to see the oncoming V2 (the 2004 Chrysler Pacifica) before initiating the left turn. On the other hand, V2 was driving within her lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute to the primary responsibility for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance while turning left at the intersection.
