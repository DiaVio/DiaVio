The reason for this is that V2 was crossing the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V1. V1, on the other hand, was traveling straight and was not at fault for the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V1 was not the cause of the collision, but rather V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V1.
