The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that he had a protected green arrow signal, but he did not notice that V2 (the driver of the Cadillac Deville) had started into the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not properly look or see the oncoming vehicle, leading to the collision. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident and was simply proceeding in their lane when V1 turned left in front of them. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance while making a left turn.
