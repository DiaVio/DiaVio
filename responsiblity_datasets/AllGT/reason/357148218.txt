The injuries sustained by the driver, such as the abrasions and contusions on the forehead, nose, and chest, as well as the rib fractures, sternum fracture, flail chest, and left ventricle tear, suggest that the driver experienced significant impact forces within the vehicle. These injuries are likely a result of contact with various interior components of the Chevrolet Malibu SUV, such as the A-pillar, sunvisor, interior door, and left instrument panel. Additionally, the liver laceration, retroperitoneum hemorrhage, spleen lacerations, and left humerus fracture indicate that the driver experienced significant internal injuries, possibly due to contact with the outboard left instrument panel. Therefore, based on the severity and nature of the driver's injuries, it can be concluded that the driver's vehicle (V1) is primarily responsible for the accident.
