The reason for this is that Vehicle One ran off the road on the left side, struck the concrete barrier, and then swerved across four lanes, ultimately colliding with the left side of Vehicle Two (GMC armored truck). The driver of Vehicle One fled the scene, indicating a potential attempt to avoid responsibility for the accident. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One is attributed to a driver-related factor, with the specific type of driver error unknown. Therefore, based on the evidence presented, Vehicle One's actions of running off the road, striking the barrier, and colliding with Vehicle Two indicate a clear responsibility for the accident.
