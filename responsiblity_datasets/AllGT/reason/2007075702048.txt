The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2 (the 2007 Honda Civic). Additionally, the driver of V1 was observed to be intoxicated at the time of the crash, and later refused to provide any information or answer questions about the events leading up to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to stop, combined with the driver's intoxication and refusal to cooperate, indicate that they were primarily responsible for the accident.
