The reason for this is that V2 initiated a left turn from the westbound lane, attempting to enter the driveway. V1 (the 1990 Volvo 240) was traveling in the eastbound lane and had the right of way. V2's left turn across the eastbound lane resulted in the collision between the front plane of V1 and the right plane of V2. Therefore, V2's decision to turn left at the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic is the main cause of the accident.
