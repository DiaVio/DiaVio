The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V1 stated that he came to a stop at the stop sign and checked for traffic, but did not see V2 (the 1992 Nissan Maxima) before pulling into the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the approaching vehicle. Additionally, V1's attempt to swerve left when he did see V2 suggests a last-minute reaction, indicating a lack of awareness and preparedness for the situation. The driver of V1 also mentioned hearing his own tires screeching, which further suggests that he was traveling at a speed that was not appropriate for the wet road conditions. Overall, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and react in a timely manner to the presence of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
