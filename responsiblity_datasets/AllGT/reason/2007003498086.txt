The driver of V1 admitted to passing a double-parked vehicle and crossing the full barrier lines while attempting to pass. This illegal maneuver resulted in V1 entering the eastbound lanes and making contact with the left side of V2 (the Mitsubishi Galant). Although V2 is reported to have encroached into the left lane, the critical reason for this event was not coded to the driver of V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an illegal maneuver and causing the collision.
