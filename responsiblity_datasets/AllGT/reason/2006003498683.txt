The driver of Vehicle # 2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection after the traffic light turned red. The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle # 2 was coded as "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," and the Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically false assumptions of other's actions. The driver of Vehicle # 2 falsely assumed that the driver of Vehicle # 1 would stop for the red light, leading to the collision.
