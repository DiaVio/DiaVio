The driver of V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions by turning left in front of V2, thinking that V2 would stop for the yellow light. This false assumption led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by holding a mobile phone with the speaker on while receiving directions from her mother. This distraction could have impaired her ability to fully assess the situation and make a safe turn. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the intersection, which may have contributed to her misjudgment of the oncoming traffic. Overall, V1's false assumption, distraction, and unfamiliarity with the roadway make her primarily responsible for the accident.
