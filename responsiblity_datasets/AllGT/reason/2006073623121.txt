Reason: The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that she might have blacked out for a minute due to a blood sugar problem. She is an insulin-dependent diabetic and had a low sugar level of 35 at the scene. Witnesses saw the front of Vehicle 1 nosedive and heard the tires on the pavement, indicating that the driver did not apply the brakes in time. The driver's medical condition and failure to control the vehicle due to the blackout make Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
