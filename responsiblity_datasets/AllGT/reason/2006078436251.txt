The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision to change lanes instead of applying the brakes, even though stopping would have avoided the crash. This decision was based on a false assumption that there were no vehicles occupying the lane V1 wanted to merge into. This misjudgment of the forward gap between V1 and V2, along with poor directional control of the vehicle, resulted in the rear-end collision. Additionally, the inspection of V1 revealed that the rear tires were underinflated, which would have increased the stopping distance needed for the vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to stop in a timely manner and the misjudgment of the gap between vehicles are the primary reasons for their responsibility in the accident.
