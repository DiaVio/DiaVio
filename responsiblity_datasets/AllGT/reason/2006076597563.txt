The reason for this is that the driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Cavalier coupe) would continue through the intersection when the traffic light turned yellow. This false assumption led to the driver of V1 not maintaining a safe following distance and failing to react in time to V2 stopping for the yellow light. Therefore, the driver of V1's false assumption and failure to react appropriately are the primary factors contributing to the accident.
