The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance and turning with an obstructed view. The driver of V1 stated that she couldn't see over the hill but proceeded with her left turn anyway, resulting in the collision with V2. The road grade was also a contributing factor as it limited sight distance at the crash location.
