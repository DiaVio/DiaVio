The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions, as indicated by the statement that he was going around the curve at approximately 41-50 mph. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's emotional upset and argument with the passenger, led to him slamming on the brakes and losing control of the vehicle. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, including excessive speed and emotional distraction, directly contributed to the crash.
