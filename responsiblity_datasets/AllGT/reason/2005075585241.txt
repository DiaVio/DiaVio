The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol test result of .373, which is significantly above the legal limit. Additionally, the driver was not wearing her prescription lenses, indicating impaired vision. These factors likely contributed to her poor directional control and inability to stay on the roadway, ultimately causing the crash.
