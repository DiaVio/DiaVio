The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was reported to be driving aggressively, changing lanes rapidly, and driving very fast. Witnesses also stated that the vehicle was acting erratic before entering the highway. This aggressive driving behavior likely contributed to the driver losing control of the vehicle, overcorrecting, and ultimately causing the collision. Additionally, it is important to note that the driver of V1 is uncertain, as it is unclear whether it was the 22-year-old female listed on the police report or her husband. However, regardless of who was driving, the aggressive driving behavior and erratic actions of V1 are the main factors that led to the collision.
