The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a left turn at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver stated that she saw cars stopped in the other lanes and proceeded to make the left turn, but she felt sure that these cars blocked her view of V2. This indicates that she did not have a clear line of sight before making the turn, which is a crucial factor in determining responsibility for a left-turn collision. Additionally, V1's speed at the time of the crash was reported to be 16 kmph, which suggests that V1 may not have been able to complete the left turn safely within the available gap in oncoming traffic. Therefore, based on the driver's decision to turn with an obstructed view and the inability to complete the turn safely, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
