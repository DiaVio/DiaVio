The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, which is a contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, V1 veered left after impacting a deer, causing it to depart the roadway and collide with a concrete culvert. The wet and rainy conditions, along with the poorly lit roadway, were also contributing factors. However, V1's high rate of speed and inability to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the crash.
