The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 drifted off the right side of the road, entered the gravel shoulder, and then attempted to re-enter the travel lanes. This action caused V1 to lose control and cross the centerline, ultimately resulting in the collision with the trees. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lanes led to the accident.
