The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which was identified as a critical reason for the crash. - The driver's decision to take the curve at a speed that was too fast for the wet roadway indicates a decision error on their part. - The driver's inexperience with the curve, as it was an alternate route for them, could have contributed to their inability to navigate it safely. - The driver's overcompensation with regard to steering and braking inputs, using overcorrective steering and aggressive braking on a wet surface, further indicates a lack of control over the vehicle. - The worn-out tires with severely underinflated conditions on V1 could have also played a role in the loss of control. Overall, V1's driver's actions, including traveling too fast for conditions, inexperience with the curve, overcompensation, and poor tire maintenance, demonstrate their primary responsibility for the crash.
