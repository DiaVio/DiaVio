The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 traveled into the opposing lane and then back into lane one, stopping at a forty-five degree angle, intending to back into the driveway. This maneuver created a hazardous situation for other vehicles on the road, including V1. V2's failure to yield the right of way and properly execute the maneuver resulted in the collision with V1.
