The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the center line, departed the left side of the road, and subsequently collided with multiple objects, including a fallen tree, a small tree, a rock outcropping, and a large tree. These events indicate a loss of control by the driver of Vehicle 1, leading to the series of collisions.
