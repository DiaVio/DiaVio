The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was attempting to make a left turn across the path of Vehicle 2, which was proceeding straight in the outboard through lane. Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and turned south, crossing the eastbound travel lane, and subsequently, the right rear side of Vehicle 1 was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
