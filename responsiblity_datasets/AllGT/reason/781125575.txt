The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to fishtail and slide from side to side. The driver's response of steering to the left resulted in the vehicle regaining traction but tracking at an angle diagonal to the trafficway. This led to V1 traveling off the left (south) roadside and ultimately colliding with a large eucalyptus tree. The driver's loss of control and subsequent actions contributed to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
