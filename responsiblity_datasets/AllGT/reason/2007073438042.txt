The reason for this is that V1 turned left at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic in lane one. The driver stated that the vehicles stopped in southbound lane two blocked her view, but she proceeded to turn anyway, assuming there was no one coming. This action of turning with an obstructed view contributed to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the BMW) was traveling in his designated lane and was not at fault for the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not responsible for the encroachment. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to turning with an obstructed view, while V2 is not at fault.
