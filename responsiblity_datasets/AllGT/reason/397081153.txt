The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the vehicle's driving characteristics and lost control of the vehicle while downshifting. This resulted in V1 veering across the centerline, overcorrecting, and ultimately colliding with a wooden utility pole. The driver's lack of familiarity with the vehicle's handling and inability to maintain control contributed to the crash.
