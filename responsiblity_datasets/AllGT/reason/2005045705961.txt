The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that it crossed over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was identified as crossing over the lane line. The critical reason for this event was an unknown decision error, possibly influenced by fatigue and the presence of methadone in the driver's system. The driver of Vehicle 1 had just returned from a two-hour drive, possibly after visiting a methadone clinic and engaging in partying the night before, according to family members. These factors suggest impaired judgment and decision-making, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the crash.
