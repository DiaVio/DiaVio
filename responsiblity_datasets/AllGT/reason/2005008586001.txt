The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was making a left turn from the gas station entrance across the southbound lanes of the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 1 had the responsibility to ensure that it was safe to make the turn and yield to oncoming traffic. However, the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway and did not see Vehicle 2 (the 2002 Ford Windstar minivan) approaching in the left southbound lane. As a result, Vehicle 1 crossed the left southbound lane and was struck by the front of Vehicle 2. The driver of Vehicle 2 stated that she was traveling at a speed of less than 40 kph (25 mph) and had little time to react to Vehicle 1 emerging from in front of the truck. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident as she was not at fault for the collision. In conclusion, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
