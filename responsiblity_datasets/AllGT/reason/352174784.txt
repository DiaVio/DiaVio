The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, traveling in the right eastbound travel lane, struck the front right plane of Vehicle 2, which was in the westbound left turn lane. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which had the right of way to make a left turn at the intersection. Additionally, Vehicle 1 was redirected to the southeast corner of the intersection and departed the roadway, coming to rest after contacting a guardrail. This suggests that Vehicle 1 was traveling at a higher speed or was unable to maintain control of the vehicle during the collision. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the failure to yield the right of way, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
