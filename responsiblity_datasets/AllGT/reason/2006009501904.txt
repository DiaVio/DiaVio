The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane and entered another lane shortly before entering the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being under the influence of alcohol and realizing that his condition was affecting his driving prior to the crash. This indicates that the driver's impairment likely contributed to the departure from the lane and the subsequent crash.
