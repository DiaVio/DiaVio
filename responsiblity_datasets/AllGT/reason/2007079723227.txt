The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle after passing a non-contact vehicle on the right. This resulted in V1 crossing all lanes and impacting the right rear of V2. The driver of V1 was found to have poor directional control, which includes factors such as aggressive driving, overcompensation, and panic freezing. Additionally, the driver of V1 had limited experience driving this type of vehicle, which may have contributed to the loss of control. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's poor directional control and loss of control of the vehicle.
