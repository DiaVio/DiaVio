The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling in the dedicated left turn lane and intended to turn left at the intersection. However, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1 (2008 Ford F-150 large pick-up truck) which was traveling straight in the southbound lane. This resulted in the frontal impact between the two vehicles.
