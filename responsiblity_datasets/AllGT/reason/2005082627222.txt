The driver of V1 was driving at a high rate of speed, attempted to pass another vehicle, and then lost control while trying to return to his original lane. Additionally, the driver was fatigued from working extended hours, had taken Sudafed, and had a BAC of 0.147. These factors, combined with the wet roadway, curve, and unfamiliarity with the route, contributed to the driver being unable to maintain control of the vehicle.
