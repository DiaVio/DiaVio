The driver of V1 stated that she was unable to stop in time due to the heavy rain and wet road conditions, resulting in her hitting the back of V2 (the 1993 Ford Ranger truck) and pushing it into V3 (the 2001 Lexus RX300). The driver of V2 also confirmed that V1 hit them from behind. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was "other motor vehicle in lane stopped" and the critical reason was "driver inattention." These factors suggest that V1's failure to stop in time and pay attention to the road were the main causes of the crash.
