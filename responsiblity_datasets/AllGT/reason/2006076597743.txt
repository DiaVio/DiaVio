The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control. The driver stated that she felt the trailer begin to tug on the rear of the vehicle and attempted to straighten it out by accelerating and applying the trailer brakes, but these actions had no effect. As a result, the truck drifted off the roadway and collided with the guard railing. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and trailer ultimately led to the rollover accident.
