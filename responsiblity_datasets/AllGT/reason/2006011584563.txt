The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, leading to the vehicle departing the lane, striking the cement median barrier, and subsequently rotating back onto the road. This initial action by V1 caused the subsequent collision with V2 (the 2005 Freightliner CBE semi-tractor trailer). Although V2 observed V1's actions and maintained his position and speed, it was V1's initial departure from the lane and collision with the median barrier that set off the chain of events leading to the accident.
