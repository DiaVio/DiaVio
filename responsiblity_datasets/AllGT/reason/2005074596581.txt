The driver of V2 stated that she approached the intersection when the light turned yellow, and although she braked, she slid into the intersection and proceeded because she was already in the middle of the intersection. This indicates that the driver of V2 failed to exercise caution and made a false assumption about the actions of other drivers. Additionally, inattention and slick roads were mentioned as associative factors for this driver, further suggesting that she did not take appropriate measures to ensure a safe crossing of the intersection.
