The reason for this is that V1 left its lane, crossed the southbound lanes, and impacted the curb, ultimately crashing into a tree. The driver of V1 claimed that the vehicle "kicked" and fishtailed on the wet road, but there were no skid marks to support this claim. Additionally, even if there was a mechanical problem with the vehicle, the driver still had sufficient time and space to avoid the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to poor directional control, traveling too fast for conditions, and inadequate evasion.
