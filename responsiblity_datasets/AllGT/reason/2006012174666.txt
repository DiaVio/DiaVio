The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 failed to stop for its red light at the intersection, resulting in a collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at his girlfriend in the right front seat instead of focusing on the roadway. The fact that the driver and the passenger in V1 were drinking alcohol at the time of the crash further contributes to V1's responsibility. The witness also confirms that V1 ran the red light and did not slow down. On the other hand, V2 had a green light and was proceeding through the intersection lawfully. There were no associated factors or critical reasons coded to V2, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to running a red light, distracted driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
