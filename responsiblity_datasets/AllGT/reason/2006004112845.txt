The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the 2001 Ford Mustang, made a left turn in front of V2, the 1996 Toyota Tercel, causing the collision. V1 falsely assumed that she had a green turn arrow and that oncoming vehicles would have a red light. This false assumption led to her making the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest any other factors contributing to V1's actions.
