The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by glancing in her rearview mirror to track a previous motor vehicle crash. This external distraction caused her to lose focus on the road ahead, resulting in her rapidly closing in on V2 (the 2007 Jeep Liberty) and ultimately colliding with it. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned feeling tired due to lack of sleep, which could have further impaired her ability to react in time to avoid the collision. While V2 was stopped in traffic and did not take any avoidance maneuver, the critical reason for the critical event in V2 was not assigned. Therefore, V2's responsibility is not clearly established in this case.
