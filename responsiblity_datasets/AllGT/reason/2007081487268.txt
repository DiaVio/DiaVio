The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by his 6-year-old daughter in the back seat, which caused him to momentarily take his eyes off the road. As a result, he failed to notice that traffic ahead had stopped and swerved left to avoid the cars, ultimately colliding with V2 (the BMW sedan) in the process. This distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road is a clear driver-related factor that led to the accident. V1's decision to change lanes without properly checking for other vehicles and failing to react in a timely manner to the stopped traffic ahead demonstrates negligence on his part, making him primarily responsible for the collision.
