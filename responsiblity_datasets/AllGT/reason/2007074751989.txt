The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Pontiac 6000, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering the roadway. The driver stated that she looked both ways but did not see V1 prior to the crash. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and yield the right-of-way to V1 resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver's vision impairment due to glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as the fact that her eyes were still recovering from being dilated, may have contributed to her inability to see V1 approaching.
