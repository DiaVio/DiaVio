The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was inadequate surveillance, specifically failing to look or looking but not seeing. Additionally, there was an associated factor of a sight-line restriction due to shrubbery at the southwest corner of the intersection. V2's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V1. V1 was traveling in the eastbound lane and had the right of way, while V2 was making a left turn from the northbound lane. V2's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and properly assess the situation led to the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
