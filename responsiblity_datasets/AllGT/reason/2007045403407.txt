The driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road, which led to the vehicle veering off the left side of the road and colliding with a utility pole. The driver admitted to looking away from the road and conversing with a passenger, which contributed to the critical pre-crash event. Additionally, the driver was driving over the posted speed limit and had only 4 hours of sleep, indicating driver fatigue and inexperience. These factors further support the driver's responsibility for the accident.
