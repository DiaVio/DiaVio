The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Volkswagen Jetta) while making a left turn at the intersection. V1 admitted to being distracted by something external to his vehicle, which caused him to enter the intersection without ensuring that it was clear. Additionally, V1 mentioned that the parked cars obstructed his view, indicating that he did not take adequate precautions before making the turn. On the other hand, V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and attempted to alert V1 by honking the horn and applying the brakes. V2's actions suggest that they were attentive and took appropriate measures to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and being distracted while making the left turn.
