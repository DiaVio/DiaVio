The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the unrestrained right front passenger of the Nissan Altima was in a fully reclined position and asleep at the time of the accident. This indicates negligence on the part of the vehicle's occupants, as they failed to take proper precautions by not wearing seat belts and by being in an unsafe position while the vehicle was in motion. The injuries sustained by the passenger, including the lacerations and fractures, were a direct result of her contact with the instrument panel and glove box upon impact.
