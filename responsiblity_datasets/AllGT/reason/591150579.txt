The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and had the obligation to yield to the oncoming traffic, which included Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2003 Nissan Murano. V1 had already come to a stop at the northbound stop limit and had begun to cross the intersection when V2 struck it on its left side. V2 failed to yield to V1 and collided with it, causing severe damage and serious injury to the driver of V1.
