The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and the curve of the on-ramp. The driver lost control of the vehicle, overcompensated, and caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, ultimately crossing the through lanes and entering the path of V2 (the Toyota Camry). This initial loss of control by V1 triggered the subsequent collisions with V2 and V3 (the Subaru Baja). Therefore, V1's failure to adjust speed for the conditions and maintain control of the vehicle is the primary reason for the accident.
