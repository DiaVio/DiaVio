The reason for this is that V2 failed to look for traffic before entering the intersection, which is a violation of the stop sign and the "caution - cross traffic does not stop" sign. This driver was distracted by looking for an address while making a delivery, which is considered a driver-related factor. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and being distracted by an external factor led to the collision.
