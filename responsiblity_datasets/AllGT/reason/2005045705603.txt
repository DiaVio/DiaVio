The driver of Vehicle #1 was driving under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol level four times the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to control the vehicle, leading to a performance error of poor directional control. Additionally, the driver was likely in a hurry and upset, which may have contributed to the driver's reckless behavior. The fact that the right front wheel was a spare donut with a lower speed rating may have also affected the vehicle's handling in the curve. Vehicle #2 (the Ford Taurus) was driving in its own lane and attempted to avoid the oncoming Vehicle #1, but was unable to do so. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is not primarily responsible for the crash.
