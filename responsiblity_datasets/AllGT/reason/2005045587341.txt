The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle #2 (the 1998 Mack 600 series dump truck) and rear-ended it. Vehicle #1's driver admitted to looking over her left shoulder to locate a break in traffic, indicating that her attention was not fully focused on the road ahead. When she looked forward again, she realized that traffic had come to a stop but was unable to avoid the collision. Additionally, the police issued Vehicle #1's driver a citation for following too closely, further indicating that she was at fault for not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her. Therefore, Vehicle #1 (the 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee) is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance and inadequate surveillance.
