The reason for this is that V2 was overtaking the non-contact vehicle (NCV) on the left while entering the intersection area. This action violated the right-of-way rules and resulted in the collision with Vehicle one (V1). V1, the 2002 Ford Taurus, was traveling in the correct lane and attempted to avoid the collision by steering left, but was unable to do so. Therefore, V2's improper overtaking maneuver caused the accident.
