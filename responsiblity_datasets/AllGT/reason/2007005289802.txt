The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while attempting to correct the vehicle's right front wheel leaving the roadway. This overcompensation caused the vehicle to travel over the opposite lane and ultimately leave the roadway, resulting in the crash. The driver's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle led to the collision with the ditch and tree. Additionally, an internal distraction was coded as an associated factor, as the driver was talking with his passengers. While this may have contributed to the driver's performance error, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for the overcompensation and subsequent crash.
