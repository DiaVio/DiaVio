The reason for this is that V1 experienced a suspension failure, which caused the vehicle to pull hard to the left and collide with the parked van, V2. The driver of V1 stated that she was unaware of any previous problems with the car and had driven it several times without incident. However, the fact remains that the suspension failure led to the loss of control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision.
