The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and cut across the northbound lanes, resulting in a collision with V2. This illegal maneuver by the driver of V1 directly caused the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for the crash and arrested for driving with a suspended license, indicating a disregard for traffic laws and safety. V2, on the other hand, was driving within the speed limit and was not thought to have contributed to the crash. The driver of V2 stated that he tried to brake and steer left to avoid the collision but was unsuccessful. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and illegal maneuver.
