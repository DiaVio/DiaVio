The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the speed and gap of V2 (the 1991 Toyota pickup) while attempting to make a left turn. V1 accelerated rapidly in an attempt to avoid a crash, but was unsuccessful and ended up being struck by V2 in the right side, rear section. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the speed and gap of V2 and their subsequent actions of accelerating instead of yielding the right of way led to the collision.
