The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an unsafe lane change without ensuring that it was clear to do so. The driver of V1 admitted to putting on her left directional signal and attempting to change lanes into the middle lane, but failed to notice the non-contact vehicle already changing lanes into the same lane from lane 3. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surrounding traffic. As a result of this unsafe lane change, V1 had to swerve right and then over-corrected by steering left, causing the vehicle to go into a counterclockwise yaw while braking. This ultimately led to V1 colliding with the median wall, first with the front and then with the right side of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to safely change lanes and maintain control of the vehicle.
