The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes and lost control, resulting in the vehicle rotating counter clockwise and entering into lane three where it impacted the right side of V2. V1's loss of control and failure to maintain proper lane position led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive due to personal factors, which likely contributed to the loss of control.
