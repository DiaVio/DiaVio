The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver of V1 stated that he applied the brakes and steered to the right when the non-contact vehicle (NCV) moved and he saw that V2 and V3 were slowing down. However, the fact that V1's vehicle skidded longitudinally indicates that the driver was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the slowing vehicles ahead makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
