The reason for this is that V1 changed into V2's lane for no apparent reason, resulting in a sideswipe collision. V1's actions caused V2 to be pushed off the roadway and resulted in damage to V2's left front wheel. Additionally, V1 fled the scene of the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. The witness also reported that the driver of V1 was potentially under the influence of alcohol, which further supports V1's responsibility for the accident.
