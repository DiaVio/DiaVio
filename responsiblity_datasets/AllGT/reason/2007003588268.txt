The driver of V2 admitted to running a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver caused V1 (the 2002 Nissan Altima) to collide with V2, and subsequently, V2 to collide with V3 (the 2004 Ford Explorer). Therefore, V2's failure to obey the traffic control device and the resulting collision make them primarily responsible for the accident.
