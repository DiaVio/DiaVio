The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to the icy road conditions on the overpass. The driver's overcompensation while trying to regain control caused the vehicle to cross the centerline and collide with V2 (the 1998 Ford Explorer). Additionally, the son-in-law mentioned that the driver's thoughts and attention might have been focused on planning a large family dinner, which could have contributed to the driver's lack of caution and awareness of the road conditions.
