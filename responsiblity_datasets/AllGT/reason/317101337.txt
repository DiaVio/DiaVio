The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 while making a left turn onto the eastbound lanes. V2 stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded across the westbound lanes into the center crossover, directly into the path of V1. This action caused the collision between the front of V1 and the right front quarter panel of V2, resulting in V1 rolling over multiple times.
