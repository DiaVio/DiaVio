The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, leading to the clockwise rotation and subsequent collision with trees. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle suggests negligence or error on their part, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
