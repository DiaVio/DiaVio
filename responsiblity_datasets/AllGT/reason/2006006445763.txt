The reason for this is that V2 was in the left turn lane (lane 2) but instead of making the required left turn, V2 proceeded straight through the intersection. This is evident from the extent of damage to V1's left side and the damage patterns, as well as the positions of both vehicles at their final resting positions. Additionally, the observation on the scene revealed that it is a common occurrence for drivers in lane 2 to go straight through the intersection, suggesting that most drivers ignore the lane markings. Therefore, V2's failure to make the required left turn and instead proceeding straight through the intersection is the primary reason for the accident.
