The reason for this is that V1 ran through the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. This is considered an illegal maneuver and a disregard of traffic control. Additionally, V1 was cited for excessive speed, inadequate surveillance, and failure to yield the right of way. These factors indicate that V1 was not exercising proper caution and responsibility while driving.
