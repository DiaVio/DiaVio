The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by traveling at a high speed (82-97kmph or 51-60mph) in wet road conditions. This decision error made it difficult for the driver to respond to the unexpected actions of other road users, such as the non-contact vehicle encroaching into his lane. Additionally, the driver's reported hurry to get to the bank before it closed may have contributed to his decision to drive at an unsafe speed. Overall, V1's excessive speed and failure to adapt to the road conditions were the primary factors leading to the vehicle control loss and subsequent accident.
