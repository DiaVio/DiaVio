The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 partially departed the right pavement edge and onto the gravel shoulder, and then re-directed into the southbound travel lane, crossing the path of Vehicle 1. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 2 made a maneuver that caused them to enter the opposing lane of traffic, resulting in the full frontal crash configuration.
