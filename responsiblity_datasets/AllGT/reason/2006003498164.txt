The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down sufficiently behind V2 and struck the rear of V2. This caused a chain reaction, with V2 being pushed into the rear of V3, and subsequently V4 being pushed into the rear of V5. Additionally, V1 fled the scene immediately after the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
