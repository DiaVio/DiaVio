The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Honda Pilot, decided to continue through the intersection when the light changed to yellow, assuming that V1 would not complete his left turn. This decision was a false assumption of the actions of other road users. V2 failed to exercise caution and yield to V1, who had the right of way to complete the left turn. As a result, V2 collided with the front right of V1 in the intersection.
