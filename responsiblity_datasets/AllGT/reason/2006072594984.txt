The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in lane one, but for some unknown reason, the driver allowed the vehicle to drift to the right, resulting in a collision with V2, V3, and V4. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle and failed to stay within their designated lane, leading to the accident.
