The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and entered the intersection to make a left turn without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 admitted that he "just didn't see them coming," indicating a failure to properly observe and assess the situation before proceeding. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2006 Chevrolet Colorado pickup) was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any critical pre-crash events or reasons attributed to their actions. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
