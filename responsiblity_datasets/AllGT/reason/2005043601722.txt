The reason for this is that V1 entered the roadway and turned left in front of V2 (the 2003 Mitsubishi Galant), misjudging its speed and distance. V1 admitted to seeing V2 approaching but still proceeded to turn, indicating a failure to yield the right of way. Additionally, V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "misjudgment of gap or other's speed." This further supports the conclusion that V1's actions were the primary cause of the accident.
