The reason for this is that V1 pulled into the roadway across both northbound lanes to turn left to southbound without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 stated that she saw a car in the outside curb lane approaching northbound and assumed it was slowing down to turn right, but she did not see a turn signal on. This indicates that V1 made a decision error by turning with an obstructed view, as the non-contact vehicle turning into the driveway obstructed her sight line. V2, on the other hand, admitted to driving over the speed limit, but she did not have time for any evasive action when V1 pulled across in front of her. While V2 was speeding, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe turn without ensuring it was clear to do so.
