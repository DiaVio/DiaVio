The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of others. This is evident from the fact that V1 was unable to avoid hitting the back of V2, despite attempting to brake and steer to the right. The driver admitted that he was keeping up with the morning traffic and was following too closely, which contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to use due care and maintain a safe following distance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
