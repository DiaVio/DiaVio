The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the police-reported travel speed of 80 kmph (exceeding the speed limit of 72 kmph) and the critical pre-crash event coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." Additionally, the driver's internal distraction of eating a sandwich while driving likely contributed to the loss of control, as indicated by the critical reason coded as "driver related factor; internal distraction." Overall, V1's excessive speed and driver distraction were the main factors leading to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
