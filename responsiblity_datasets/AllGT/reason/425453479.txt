The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was the one that traveled off the road to the right while negotiating the left curve. It then impacted multiple trees with its front and right planes, causing damage to the trees and the vehicle itself. The driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain control and stay on the road, resulting in the collision.
