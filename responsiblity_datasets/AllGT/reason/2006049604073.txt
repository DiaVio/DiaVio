The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, which is a driver-related factor. The driver stopped at the stop sign and looked to the right, but did not stop again at the line of sight. The driver claimed that her view of V2 was obstructed by a building, but she should have stopped at the line of sight as required. If she had done so, V2 would have been clearly visible. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to stop at the line of sight.
