The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than V1, which was indicated by the critical pre-crash event coded for V2 as "other vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with lower steady speed." Additionally, V2 was driving too fast to be able to respond to the presence of V1, especially considering the wet road conditions. This is evident from the critical reason coded for V2 as a driver-related factor: "too fast to be able to respond to others (specified as: V1 starting in traffic way plus wet roads)." Therefore, V2's excessive speed and inability to respond appropriately to the situation led to the collision with V1.
