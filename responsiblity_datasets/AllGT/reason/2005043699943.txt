The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 97 kmph (60 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). Additionally, the police report information suggested that the driver of V1 was speeding. This indicates that V1 was traveling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions, which likely contributed to the vehicle losing control, traveling off the roadway, and ultimately colliding with a tree and rolling over. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was unable to be located for an interview, so further information regarding the driver's actions or potential contributing factors is not available. However, based on the available information, V1's excessive speed appears to be the primary reason for the crash.
