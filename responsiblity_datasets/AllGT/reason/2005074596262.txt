The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to smoking methamphetamine and drinking alcohol earlier, which impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. Additionally, the driver knew about an accelerator problem before the crash, where the vehicle would not remain running unless the driver held their foot on the gas and then put the vehicle into gear. Despite this knowledge, the driver failed to control the vehicle as it sped down the street and crashed into the side of a building. The driver's altered conscious state and inability to control the vehicle due to the accelerator sticking at full throttle contributed to the crash.
