The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control of the vehicle due to a tire failure. The driver then crashed into the right concrete barrier and attempted to leave the scene. The fact that the driver fled the accident scene before the police arrived suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability. Additionally, the police were unable to identify the driver as there were multiple names associated with the contents of the wallet found in the vehicle. This further indicates a lack of responsibility on the part of the driver. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control and subsequent attempt to flee the scene.
