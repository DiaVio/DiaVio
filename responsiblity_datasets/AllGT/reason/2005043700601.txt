The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were backing into a driveway from the left side of the road, which is an unexpected and potentially dangerous maneuver. V1 should have ensured that it was safe to back up and should have been aware of any oncoming vehicles. Additionally, V1's reverse lights and emergency flashers may not have been sufficient warning for V2 to react in time to avoid the collision. V2 (the 1986 Pontiac Grand Prix coupe) also shares some responsibility for the accident due to inadequate surveillance (failure to look far enough ahead). However, V2's speed at impact was significantly higher than V1's, indicating that V2 may have been traveling too fast for the conditions and did not have enough time to react and avoid the collision. Overall, V1's backing maneuver and failure to ensure it was safe to do so, combined with V2's inadequate surveillance and potentially excessive speed, led to the collision.
