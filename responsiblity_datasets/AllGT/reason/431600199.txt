The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the left (north) pavement edge and enter a wooded ravine, resulting in a non-horizontal impact with a stand of trees. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the severe damage and subsequent injuries.
