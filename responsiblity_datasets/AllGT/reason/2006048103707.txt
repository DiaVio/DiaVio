The reason for this is that V1, which was traveling eastbound, failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle two (V2), which was stopped in the first lane ahead of V1. As a result, the front of V1 made contact with the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was following too closely and did not have enough time to stop or avoid the collision.
