The reason for this is that V1 was reported to have run a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. This action resulted in V1 colliding with V2 (the 2004 Honda Odyssey minivan) and subsequently causing a chain reaction with V3 (the 1992 Toyota Camry sedan). Additionally, the driver of V1 was emotionally upset about her boyfriend, which may have contributed to her disregard for traffic laws and her failure to properly observe the intersection.
