The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver swerved left to avoid a wild turkey, but lost control of the vehicle and ultimately crashed into a utility pole. This indicates a performance error of overcompensation, as the driver's reaction to the animal in the roadway led to the loss of control. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was familiar with the roadway and traveling at a speed between 50 and 64 KMPH (31 and 40 MPH), which suggests that the driver should have been able to react appropriately to the situation and maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
