The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that they were attempting to make a left turn from the turning lane, but failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically Vehicle #2 approaching from the east. This is indicated by the critical reason for Vehicle #1 being "inadequate surveillance." Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver stated that she did not see Vehicle #2 approaching. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was traveling in the right lane, approaching a green light, and attempted to maneuver to the right to avoid Vehicle #1, but ended up striking Vehicle #1 in the right rear. The associative factors for Vehicle #2 include driver inattention due to conversation with the passenger and the presence of another vehicle that passed her at a higher rate of speed and turned at the intersection she was approaching. However, it is important to note that Vehicle #2's actions were a reaction to Vehicle #1's failure to yield the right of way. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic while attempting to make a left turn.
