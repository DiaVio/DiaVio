The reason for this is that the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically inadequate surveillance. This means that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to properly observe and assess the situation before proceeding through the intersection, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2. Additionally, Vehicle #2 (BMW Z3) had the right of way and did not have a stop sign, indicating that Vehicle #1 should have yielded to Vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that she saw Vehicle #1 stop or slow down at the stop sign, but still proceeded through the intersection, attempting to avoid the impact by steering right. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to the right of way.
