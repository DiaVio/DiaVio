The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 drove off the right side of the roadway and struck a telephone pole guide wire anchor. The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted that he realized he was going to hit the pole and swerved, but ultimately hit the side guard. This indicates that the driver made an error in judgment and failed to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, there is no evidence of braking or avoidance maneuvers, suggesting that the driver did not take appropriate action to prevent the collision.
