The reason for this is that V2 swerved onto the paved shoulder to avoid hitting a deer, but then swerved back onto the roadway and began rotating counterclockwise, crossing over the centerline into the opposite eastbound lane. This action caused the collision with Vehicle One (V1), the 2001 Ford Focus. V2's rotation continued, causing the right side back of V2 to impact the left side of V1. The impact then forced V2 laterally across the westbound lane and onto the north side paved shoulder, where it collided with a guard rail and came to a final rest. Therefore, V2's initial swerving and subsequent rotation into the opposite lane resulted in the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
