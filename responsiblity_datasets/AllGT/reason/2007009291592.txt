The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn in front of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Toyota Sienna) without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 approaching before initiating the left turn. This lack of surveillance, combined with the distraction of being engaged in an animated conversation on her cell phone, led to V1 turning in front of V2 and causing the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
