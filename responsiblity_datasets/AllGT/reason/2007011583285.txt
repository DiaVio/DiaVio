The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. She stated that she looked both ways but did not see V2 approaching from the southbound lane. This recognition error, along with the fact that V1 made the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so, led to the collision. Additionally, there is no mention of any contributing factors on the part of V2 that would suggest she was at fault. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
