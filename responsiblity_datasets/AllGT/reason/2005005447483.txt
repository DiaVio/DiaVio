The reason for this is that V2 was exiting the parking lot driveway and turning left onto the roadway, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 failed to yield to V1, who was traveling on the painted median in the center of the road. V1 had the right of way as there were no traffic control devices for V1 to stop or yield at the intersection. Additionally, V2's critical reason for the pre-crash event was a recognition error, as the impending problem (V1 approaching) was masked by the traffic flow pattern in the southbound lane. This indicates that V2 did not properly assess the situation and failed to recognize the presence of V1.
