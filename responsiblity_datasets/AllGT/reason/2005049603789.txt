The reason for this is that V1 ran a red light, as reported by the driver himself. Despite the driver claiming that his light was yellow, he did not slow down and stop for the red light, but instead decided to proceed through the intersection. This illegal maneuver directly led to the collision with V2 (the 1997 Nissan Sonata) that was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection.
