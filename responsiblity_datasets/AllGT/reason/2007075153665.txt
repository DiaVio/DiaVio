The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made several errors that contributed to the crash. Firstly, the driver attempted to pass a slower moving vehicle in front of him by changing lanes to the right in a left curve. This shows poor judgment and a lack of understanding of safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced, with only 12 months of driving experience, and had only received classroom driver's education, which may not have adequately prepared him for real-world driving situations. Finally, the driver exhibited poor directional control, as evidenced by the fact that V1 departed the roadway to the right and collided with a metal fence. Overall, the driver's inexperience, poor decision-making, and lack of control over the vehicle make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
