The reason for this is that V2 failed to observe the traffic control device, as indicated by the associative factor of an illegal maneuver. V2 claimed to have entered the intersection on the yellow phase of the traffic signal, but there is no evidence to support this statement. Additionally, V2 encroached over the left lane line of the opposing traffic, which led to the collision with V1. Therefore, V2's failure to obey the traffic signal and encroachment into the opposing lane make them primarily responsible for the accident.
