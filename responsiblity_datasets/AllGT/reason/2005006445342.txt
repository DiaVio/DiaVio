The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it attempted to change lanes to the parking lane along the east curb edge after crossing the intersection. This lane change maneuver was not executed safely, as V1 failed to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic before making the lane change. The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane stopped," indicating that there was another vehicle in the lane that V1 failed to notice or properly account for. As a result of V1's inadequate surveillance and unsafe lane change, it collided with the rear of Vehicle Two (V2), initiating the chain reaction of collisions involving Vehicles Three and Four. The fact that V1's front contacted the rear of V2 suggests that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the traffic and execute a safe lane change makes them primarily responsible for the four-vehicle crash.
