The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound on the through street and intended to make a right turn onto a cross street. However, V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. V2 encroached into the path of V1, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and encroachment into the intersection caused the accident, making them primarily responsible.
