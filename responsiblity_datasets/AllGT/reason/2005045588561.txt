The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with following too closely, indicating that they failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them. This is supported by the critical reason for the critical event, which was coded as following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. Additionally, the driver's statement that the SUV changed lanes in front of them just moments before traffic came to a stop suggests that they were not able to react in time to the changing traffic conditions. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the traffic conditions.
