The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to change lanes without ensuring that there was enough space in the intended lane. This resulted in V1 realizing there was another vehicle already in the lane and attempting to re-enter the original travel lane. However, the driver overcompensated, causing V1 to depart multiple lanes to the left, ultimately colliding with the raised divider and rolling over. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and execute a safe lane change is the primary reason for the crash.
