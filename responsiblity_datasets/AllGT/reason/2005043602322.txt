The reason for this is that V2, the unknown vehicle on the intersecting road, failed to yield for a posted stop sign and turned in front of V1. This action by V2 forced V1's driver to steer to the left to avoid a collision, ultimately causing V1 to drive off the road and into a ditch. V1's driver was looking straight ahead and was unable to avoid the sudden crossing of V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for failing to yield and causing the accident.
