The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by his rear seat passengers, which caused him to turn his attention away from the road. This distraction led to a recognition error, where he failed to notice that V1 was veering off the left side of the roadway. Additionally, the driver's vision impairment, as indicated by his use of bifocals for myopic and hyperopic conditions, may have contributed to his inability to react in time to avoid the crash. Furthermore, the driver's use of prescription medications for high blood pressure and diabetes could have potentially affected his ability to operate the vehicle safely. Overall, the combination of driver distraction, vision impairment, and the possible effects of medication use suggests that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
