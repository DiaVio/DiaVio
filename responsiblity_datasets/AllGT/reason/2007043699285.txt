The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was stopped in the parking lot, waiting to turn left onto the roadway. Vehicle 2 (Nissan Versa) was traveling east in lane 2, and Vehicle 1 proceeded to turn left across the path of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated the travel and impact speeds of both vehicles to be 24 kmph (15 mph), suggesting that neither vehicle was exceeding the posted speed limit. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 for failing to yield and turning across the path of Vehicle 2.
