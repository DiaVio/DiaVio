The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act, which caused her to black out while driving. This impairment led to her traveling at a higher rate of speed and ultimately colliding with the back of V1 (the Freightliner school bus). The driver's physical condition and impairment were identified as critical factors in the crash.
