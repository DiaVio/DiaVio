The reason for this is that V1 was weaving in and out of multiple lanes, zigzagging through traffic, and reaching high rates of speed. This behavior indicates reckless driving and a disregard for the safety of other road users. Additionally, the driver of V1 contradicted witness reports and claimed that the driver of V2 was attempting to cross their path to make a left turn, which could not be verified. While V2 (the driver of the BMW 325Ci) was found to have inadequate surveillance as the critical reason for the pre-crash event, it is important to note that V1's reckless driving and weaving through traffic created a dangerous situation that ultimately led to the collision.
