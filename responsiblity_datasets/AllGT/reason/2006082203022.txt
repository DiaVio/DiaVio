The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that Vehicle two crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the path of Vehicle one (1991 Buick Park Avenue) which was turning left at the intersection. Therefore, Vehicle two's encroachment into the opposite lane caused the collision with Vehicle one, making Vehicle two primarily responsible for the accident.
