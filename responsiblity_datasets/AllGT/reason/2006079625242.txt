The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn into an apartment building's driveway, and according to the critical pre-crash event, the driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the Honda Accord) approaching from the opposite direction. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was turning into the driveway to turn around and look for a parking spot, which suggests that V1's intention was to change direction and find parking, rather than continuing on the road. This further supports the notion that V1 was at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn.
