The driver of V1 was suffering from an unknown mental disorder and was not regularly taking the prescribed medication for it. This impaired his ability to drive and was identified as a critical non-performance factor. Additionally, the driver was late for a job interview and had only 4 hours of sleep in the previous 24-hour period, indicating fatigue as a contributing factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired mental state, failure to take medication, and potential fatigue.
