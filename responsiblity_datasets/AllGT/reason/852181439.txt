The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, impacting an embankment and causing the vehicle to roll over multiple times before coming to a rest. The driver of V1 was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, which likely contributed to the severity of his injuries. Additionally, there were no airbag deployments, indicating that the vehicle did not have any safety features that could have mitigated the impact of the crash.
