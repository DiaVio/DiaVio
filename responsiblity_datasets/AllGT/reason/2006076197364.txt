The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the curve. The speed limit on the roadway was 40 kmph (25 mph), and there was a curve advisory speed sign indicating a recommended speed of 26 kmph (15 mph). Despite these warnings, V1 was traveling at the speed limit and failed to adjust their speed to the curvature of the road. Additionally, the driver's focus on a conversation with their passenger, who was discussing serious personal problems, likely distracted them from paying full attention to the road and the curve ahead. This lack of attention and failure to adjust speed accordingly resulted in V1 losing control of the vehicle and sliding off the roadway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions of the curve and being distracted by a conversation with their passenger.
