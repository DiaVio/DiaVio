The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and did not see it. This is indicated by the driver's statement that he did not see the stop sign and his admission that he was unfamiliar with the roadway. The driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to obey the traffic control device led to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the G-series package delivery van) also contributed to the crash by not being able to avoid getting hit by V1. However, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and V2's attempt to accelerate to avoid the collision indicate that V1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
