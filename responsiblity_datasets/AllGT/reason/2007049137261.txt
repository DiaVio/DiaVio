The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a U-turn in the intersection without ensuring that there was enough room to do so. V1 then backed into the intersection, which resulted in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 prior to backing into the intersection, indicating a failure to adequately survey the area before making the maneuver. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance is the critical reason for the accident.
