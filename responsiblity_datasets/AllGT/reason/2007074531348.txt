The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle traveling through the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V2 admitted to seeing V1 enter the intersection but failed to take appropriate action to avoid the collision. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and attentiveness on the part of the driver of V2.
