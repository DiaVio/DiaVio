The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was following the vehicle in front of her at a distance of only one car length, which is not a safe following distance. Additionally, she was traveling slightly over the speed limit at 105 kmph (65 mph) in a 97 kmph (60 mph) speed zone. When the vehicle in front applied its brakes, the driver of V1 attempted to avoid a collision by applying her brakes and changing lanes. However, she overcompensated and turned the wheel to the right, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and ultimately roll over onto its roof. The driver's overcompensation and excessive speed were the critical factors that led to the crash.
