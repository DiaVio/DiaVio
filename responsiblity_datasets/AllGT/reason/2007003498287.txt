The driver of V1 went through a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic laws. This action caused the front of V1 to impact the right side of V2 (the Honda Passport), leading to a chain reaction where V2 rotated counterclockwise and the front of V3 (the Toyota Solara) contacted the back of V2. The driver of V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and proceed through the intersection when it was not safe to do so directly caused the collision. This violation of traffic laws and failure to yield the right of way to V2 makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
