The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver was distracted by external factors, specifically engaging in conversation with her daughter and discussing the new building on the southeast corner of the intersection. This distraction caused the driver to fail to recognize that the traffic light was still red, leading to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver distraction.
