The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in the right inbound travel lane and crossed over the grassy median into the southbound travel lane, causing the collision with Vehicle #2 (V2), the school bus. V1's clockwise rotation on the wet roadway and entry into the opposite lane indicates a loss of control or failure to maintain proper lane position, which ultimately led to the impact with V2.
