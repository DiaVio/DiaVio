The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and attempting to pass a farm tractor. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with the driver's inexperience, led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's decision to hit the brakes and steer right when the vehicle was about to depart the left side of the roadway further contributed to the accident. Additionally, the driver's statement that she was distracted by talking to the passengers and looking away from the road indicates a lack of attention and focus while driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's aggressive driving behavior, inexperience, and lack of attention.
