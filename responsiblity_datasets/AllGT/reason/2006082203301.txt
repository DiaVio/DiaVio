The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an external factor, specifically, the merging vehicle in lane three. This distraction caused V1 to not pay attention to the vehicles in front of them, resulting in V1 failing to slow down in time and colliding with the rear of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react to the slowing traffic is the main cause of the collision.
