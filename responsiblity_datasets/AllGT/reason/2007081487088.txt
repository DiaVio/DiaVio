The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she exhibited poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason coded as "driver related factor: poor directional control." This means that V1 failed to control her vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, resulting in her departure from the roadway and subsequent collision with the guardrail and embankment wall. Additionally, the associative factors of panic/freezing, being uncomfortable with general traffic flow, making a decision to pull onto a shoulder with insufficient clearance, and traveling too fast further contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident. These factors suggest that V1's actions and decision-making were not in line with safe driving practices. Furthermore, the presence of alcohol in V1's system, as indicated in the police report, may have impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. It is important to note that driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal and significantly increases the risk of accidents. While V2 (the vehicle approaching from behind) may have been a contributing factor in V1's decision to pull over onto the right shoulder, ultimately, V1's poor directional control and related factors are the primary cause of the accident.
