The witness stated that V1 stopped at the exit for a few seconds and then pulled right out in front of V2, giving V2 no chance to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, which is a common error when making a left turn. Additionally, the associative factors for V1 include inadequate surveillance and a possible sight line restriction or external distraction. These factors suggest that V1 may not have been paying enough attention or properly assessing the traffic conditions before making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 was traveling at the reported speed limit and had the right of way in the #2 lane. The driver of V2 stated that the large truck passed by V1 and then V1 quickly pulled out in front of him. V2 attempted to brake and steer left to avoid the collision, indicating that V2 took appropriate evasive action. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance.
