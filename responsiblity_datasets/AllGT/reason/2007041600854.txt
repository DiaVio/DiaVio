The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive action by steering to the right instead of just hitting the brakes. This action caused V1 to depart the roadway and collide with a concrete wall fence. Although the driver's intention was to avoid a crash with the non-contact Mercedes SUV encroaching into their lane, the incorrect evasive action ultimately led to the accident.
