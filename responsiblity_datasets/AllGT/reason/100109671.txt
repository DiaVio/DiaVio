The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to travel off the roadway and onto the gravel shoulder while negotiating a right curving downgrade. The driver then abruptly steered right, causing the vehicle to enter a clockwise yaw and strike a small metal post with its left front door. This action led to the vehicle returning to the roadway in a yaw, crossing it, and ultimately exiting the roadway on the south side. The vehicle became airborne, landed on its left side, and continued to overturn multiple times, striking large rocks at each landing. Therefore, the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the roadway, as well as the abrupt steering maneuver, are the primary reasons for V1 being responsible for the accident.
