The reason for this is that the driver of V1 missed the beginning of the exit ramp but still attempted to merge through the painted gore. This decision error, along with factors such as driver inexperience and roadway unfamiliarity, led to the crash. The driver's failure to properly navigate the exit ramp and merge safely resulted in the collision with the impact attenuator.
