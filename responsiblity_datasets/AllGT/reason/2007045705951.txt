The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the arterial road from the residential street. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, as indicated by the "inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see" coding. - V1's driver admitted to being in a slight hurry due to a tight delivery schedule, which may have contributed to her failure to properly observe oncoming traffic. - V1's driver was also coded as fatigued due to her sleep schedule and suffered from diagnosed but untreated sleep apnea, which could have impaired her alertness and reaction time. - V1's driver was also coded as experiencing panic/freezing as the critical reason for the crash, further indicating a lack of proper decision-making and response in the situation. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
