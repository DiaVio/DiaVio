The reason for this is that V1 was traveling behind V2 and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a rear-end collision. V1's failure to stop or slow down in time to avoid the collision indicates negligence on the part of the driver. Additionally, the fact that V1 was traveling slightly forward and to the right after the initial impact suggests that the driver may have been distracted or not paying proper attention to the road.
