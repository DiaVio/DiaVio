The reason for this is as follows: - The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted by his passengers screaming, which caused him to be startled and lose focus on the road. - The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to recognize the presence of the stopped Vehicle #2 until the last second before applying the brakes and impact. - The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to talking to his passenger and smoking a cigarette, indicating a lack of attention to the road. - The driver of Vehicle #1 had inadequate surveillance and failed to look far enough ahead, which could have prevented the collision. - The driver of Vehicle #1 had various contributing factors that affected his driving abilities, including lack of sleep, prescribed medication that can cause drowsiness, and symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome. Therefore, based on these factors, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
