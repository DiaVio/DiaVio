The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while driving, which led to V1 crossing the double barrier lines and striking V2 head-on. The driver's statement of not remembering anything about the crash and admitting to falling asleep supports this conclusion. Additionally, the driver's long period of wakefulness (23.5 hours) and the fact that he had been hanging out with friends all night indicate fatigue as a contributing factor. While the fog and lack of lighting on the road were associated environmental factors, V1's driver falling asleep and crossing into the opposite lane were the critical pre-crash events that directly caused the collision. The absence of pre-impact tire marks from either vehicle suggests that neither driver attempted to brake before the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's fatigue and falling asleep while driving.
