The reason for this is that V1 swerved right to avoid a pedestrian crossing the roadway, but over-steered and lost control of the vehicle. This overcompensation by the driver led to V1 departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with the concrete base of an overhead traffic light. Additionally, the driver fled the scene and refused to provide further information, making it difficult to determine the exact circumstances and any potential contributing factors. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's actions of over-steering and losing control of the vehicle, as well as fleeing the scene, indicate a lack of responsible driving behavior, making V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
