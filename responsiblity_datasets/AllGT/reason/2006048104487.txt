The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn to travel westbound, but failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to not stopping again when he got to the stop sign, indicating an illegal maneuver. In addition, inadequate surveillance was also a factor for V1. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1992 Honda Accord sedan) was traveling eastbound in lane three and struck the left side of V1 as it entered the intersection. While V2 had an additional factor of being internally distracted by putting on a seat belt, the critical reason for the accident was not coded to V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the illegal maneuver and failure to stop for the stop sign.
