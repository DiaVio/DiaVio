The reason for this is that V1 attempted to turn left across the path of V2, which was traveling straight in its lane. V1 incorrectly assumed that all other traffic would yield to it, even though it had the right of way. This false assumption of the other road users' actions, combined with the driver's inexperience, led to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the Honda CR-V) was found to have entered the intersection on a red light, but the reason for this is unknown. Therefore, while V2 may have contributed to the accident by running a red light, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe left turn.
