The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was unable to slow down and lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it veering off the roadway, striking a guardrail, and ultimately hitting a tree. The critical reason for the crash was determined to be a driver-related factor, specifically poor directional control. This suggests that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, leading to the accident. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the driver's claim that the brakes malfunctioned. The service manager at the repair facility stated that the brakes did not malfunction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the driver's inability to control the vehicle was not due to a mechanical failure but rather a failure on the part of the driver. Overall, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their poor directional control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
