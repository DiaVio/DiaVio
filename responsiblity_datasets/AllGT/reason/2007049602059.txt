The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). This failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 turning in front of V2, causing the collision. While V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet S-10 pick-up) did not detect V1 until it appeared in front of him, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction over the left lane line. This suggests that V2 was already in their lane and V1 encroached into their path while making the left turn. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
