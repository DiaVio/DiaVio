The reason for this is that V1 steered right and departed the roadway in an attempt to avoid a head-on collision with a non-contact vehicle traveling in the opposite direction. However, V1 then overcorrected by steering right again, causing the vehicle to rotate clockwise and ultimately roll over. This indicates poor directional control and unsuccessful evasive action on the part of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that everything would have been fine if it had not been for the gravel driveway, suggesting that the driver may have been distracted or not fully focused on the road. Therefore, V1's actions, including overcompensation, unsuccessful evasive action, and poor directional control, along with the potential external distraction, contribute to V1 being primarily responsible for the crash.
