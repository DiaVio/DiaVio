The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control by the driver. The driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, as indicated by the fact that the right front tire went off the right edge of the roadway. Despite the driver's attempts to regain control and return to the roadway, the vehicle continued tracking along the grassy ditch until it struck a guardrail and came to rest. Additionally, associated factors such as traveling too fast for the conditions, insufficient steering input, and a roadway-related deficiency contribute to V1's responsibility. The posted speed limit on the roadway was 35 mph, but the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle within the given conditions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and failure to adapt to the roadway conditions.
