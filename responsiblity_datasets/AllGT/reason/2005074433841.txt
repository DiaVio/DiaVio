The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to stop for a red traffic signal, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan). The driver of V1 was found to be inattentive and daydreaming, which led to the driver's failure to properly surveil the traffic signal control device. Additionally, the driver's recent medication change for anxiety and depression may have contributed to the driver's inattention.
