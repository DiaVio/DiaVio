The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before turning left onto the roadway. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 (the Dodge Grand Caravan) approaching and did not have a chance to make any avoidance maneuvers. This indicates a driver recognition error and inadequate surveillance, which are critical factors leading to the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was focused on an extraneous vehicle and the congestion on the road, which further contributed to the inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, V2 was driving within the speed limit and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, but was unable to do so due to the sudden appearance of V1 in front of him. The driver of V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and a driver recognition error.
