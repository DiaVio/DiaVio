The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by checking her seat belt and looking down, resulting in a driver-related recognition error. This distraction caused her to fail to notice that the vehicles ahead had stopped, leading to the rear-end collision with Vehicle #2 (1992 Subaru Legacy). The driver's inexperience, being a 16-year old with a junior license, further contributed to the recognition error. Although Vehicle #2 was pushed into Vehicle #3 (1999 Plymouth Voyager) as a result of the collision, the driver of Vehicle #2 was not at fault. He was stopped in traffic, waiting for the traffic signal to change, and had his foot on the brake. Therefore, Vehicle #2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the crash. In conclusion, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and recognition error, compounded by her inexperience.
