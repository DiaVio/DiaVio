The driver of Vehicle #1 was attempting to make a U-turn from a parked position, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver's decision to make the U-turn without adequate surveillance, as indicated by the driver recognition error of inadequate surveillance, contributed to the crash. Even though the driver of Vehicle #1 claimed that the driver of Vehicle #2 was traveling at a high rate of speed, it is still the responsibility of Vehicle #1 to ensure that it is safe to make a U-turn before proceeding. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (the Dodge Grand Caravan) was traveling straight in the second lane of travel and did not have any critical reasons or associated factors coded to its driver. Therefore, Vehicle #2 does not bear primary responsibility for the crash.
