The driver of V1, an 18-year-old female, failed to adequately survey the traffic lanes nearest to her before making her left turn. She admitted that she may have been too focused on her turn destination and neglected to look at the oncoming traffic. Additionally, she was an inexperienced driver who rarely traveled on this road. These factors, along with the wet road conditions, contributed to her inadequate surveillance and ultimately led to the collision with V2.
