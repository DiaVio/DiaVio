The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was turning left (south) at the intersection and entered the opposing travel lane, crossing the path of Vehicle 1 (the 2007 Nissan Sentra). This action resulted in the frontal impact between the two vehicles. Additionally, it is mentioned that Vehicle 2 sustained moderate damage, while Vehicle 1 suffered severe damage. This suggests that the impact was more significant on Vehicle 1, indicating that Vehicle 2 was primarily at fault for not yielding the right of way and causing the collision.
