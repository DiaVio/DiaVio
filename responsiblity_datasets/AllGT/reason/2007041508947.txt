The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a u-turn from the southbound lane into the northbound lane, which is a dangerous maneuver. V1 then stopped in V2's travel lane to avoid a collision with a phantom vehicle making a right turn. This sudden stop by V1 caused V2 to collide with the right side of V1. Although V2 tried to avoid the collision by steering right and applying brakes, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe u-turn and stopping abruptly in the travel lane. Additionally, V1 fled the scene, which further indicates their negligence in the situation.
