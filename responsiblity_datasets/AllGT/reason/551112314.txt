The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed from its designated lane and traveled onto the painted area of the median, ultimately impacting the raised curb median. This action caused V1 to rotate clockwise and veer across multiple lanes before departing the roadway and colliding with a tree. The driver of V1 was also found to be partially ejected from the vehicle, indicating a lack of proper restraint usage.
