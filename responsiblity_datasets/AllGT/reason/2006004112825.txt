The driver of V1 failed to come to a complete stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection without adequately checking for oncoming traffic. This is evident from the fact that V1 only slowed down at the stop sign and claimed that the parked vehicles obstructed their view. The driver's inadequate surveillance and illegal maneuver of not stopping at the stop sign contributed to the collision. While V2 (the Toyota Camry) assumed that V1 would stop for the stop sign, their assumption does not absolve V1 of their responsibility. V2's inattention and false assumption also played a role in the accident, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not following the traffic rules and failing to yield the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to come to a complete stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance.
