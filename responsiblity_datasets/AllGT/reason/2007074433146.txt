The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was driving under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of .440, which is significantly above the legal limit. - V1 admitted to feeling fatigued and being emotionally distressed, which likely impaired his ability to drive safely. - V1 stated that he did not see V2 prior to the crash, indicating inadequate surveillance on his part. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into opposite direction," suggesting that V1 failed to yield to V2 while making the left turn. Therefore, V1's impaired condition, inadequate surveillance, and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make him primarily responsible for the accident.
