The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 suddenly stopped due to heavy traffic congestion, causing Vehicle 1 (2005 Dodge Neon SXT intermediate sedan) to rear-end it. The sudden stop of Vehicle 2 created a chain reaction, leading to subsequent impacts between Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3, and between Vehicle 3 and Vehicle 4. Therefore, the initial fault lies with Vehicle 2 for abruptly stopping in the southbound travel lane without sufficient warning or time for Vehicle 1 to react and avoid the collision.
