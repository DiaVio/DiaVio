The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling southbound on a five-lane urban roadway and failed to negotiate a right curve. As a result, Vehicle 1 departed the east pavement edge and impacted a large diameter tree, causing severe damage. The driver of Vehicle 1 was injured in the collision and had to be transported to a hospital for treatment.
