The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1992 Chevrolet Corsica) who was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1 stated that she was distracted by looking for an address and did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates that V1 was not paying proper attention to the road and failed to ensure it was clear before making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 was traveling straight in her lane and took evasive action by applying the brakes and steering to the right when she realized that V1 was turning in front of her. This suggests that V2 was following the rules of the road and reacted appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way and being distracted while making the left turn.
