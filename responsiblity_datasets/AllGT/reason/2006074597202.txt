The driver of V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. The critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: inattention. This suggests that the driver of V1 was not paying attention while making the left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was experiencing multiple stressors, including work stress and fatigue. These factors may have contributed to the driver's inattention and lack of focus on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
