The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it, as stated in the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1. This driver was distracted by plugging in a cell phone charger and did not see V2 (the 1998 Chevrolet 1500 pickup) until just prior to impact.
