The reason for this is that the trailer being pulled by V2 came loose from the power unit and crossed over into the southbound travel lanes, ultimately striking V1. The driver of V2 admitted that he was using the wrong connector sizes and that the trailer was in a condition of disrepair. Additionally, he stated that he was uncomfortable pulling the trailer. These factors indicate negligence on the part of the driver of V2, as he failed to properly secure the trailer and ensure its safe operation.
