The reason for this is that V1 was approaching the stopped vehicles and failed to stop in time or take appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision. V1's driver braked and steered right, but still ended up impacting the back right of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2004 Dodge Ram large pickup. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control and avoid the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
