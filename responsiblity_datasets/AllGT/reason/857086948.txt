The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control for unknown reasons, possibly due to a preceding medical condition. Vehicle 1 crossed the center line and entered the eastbound travel lane, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2. This initial loss of control by Vehicle 1 initiated the chain of events leading to the subsequent collision between Vehicle 2 and Vehicle 3.
