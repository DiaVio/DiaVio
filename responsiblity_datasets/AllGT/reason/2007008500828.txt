The driver of V1 was charged with DUI after posting a 0.19 BAC test, indicating that he was driving under the influence of alcohol. Witnesses stated that the vehicle was traveling at a high speed and suddenly began weaving before driving off the road. The driver admitted to adjusting the radio and swerving suddenly because he believed there was another car in front of him going slower. Additionally, the driver suffers from a corneal abrasion that causes blurry vision, muscle spasms, and a back ailment that causes pain. He is prescribed multiple medications for these ailments, including Clonapin, Soma, and Zyprexa. The driver's father also mentioned that the driver is a recovering drug addict and had previously taken too much of his prescription medication and passed out. The presence of Tramadol, Red Bull, Tilt, and Mikes Hard Lemonade in the vehicle further suggests impaired judgment and potential substance use. Based on these factors, it is clear that the driver of V1 was not in proper control of the vehicle due to impaired judgment and physical conditions, as well as the influence of alcohol and potentially other substances. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
