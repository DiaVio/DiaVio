The driver of V1 ran a red light, as confirmed by an independent witness, and continued through the intersection despite the light turning red. This action directly led to the collision with V2, which was in the process of making a left turn. Although V2's driver made a false assumption about the actions of other drivers, it was V1's violation of the traffic signal that initiated the sequence of events leading to the accident. Additionally, V1's driver was distracted by conversing with a passenger and had only one year of driving experience, indicating a lack of attention and possibly inadequate judgment. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for the red light and their illegal maneuver make them primarily responsible for the accident.
