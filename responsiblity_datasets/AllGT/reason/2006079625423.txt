The reason for this is that V1 was making an illegal U-turn across the path of V2. The on-scene witness confirmed this by stating that they observed V1 making the U-turn. Additionally, the damage on V1 does not support the driver's claim that V2 rear-ended them. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver caused the collision.
