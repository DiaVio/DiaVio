The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the left, crossed over the center paved strip, and traveled into the lane of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee compact utility vehicle. V1's front left impacted V2's left side, indicating that V1 was in the wrong lane and caused the collision.
