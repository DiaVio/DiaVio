The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at the houses on the right side of the road. When he returned his attention to the roadway, he realized that V2 was stopped and attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes and steering right. However, it was his distraction that caused him to not notice the stopped vehicle in time, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1998 Ford Explorer) was stopped at the intersection for about two minutes and did not see V1 prior to the crash. While V2 was traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related external distraction.
