The driver of V1 ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. This is supported by the witness statement that the light had just turned red and V1 went through it. The driver of V1 also stated that she did not see the light turn red and thought it was green. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event being "inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see)." The wet roads and view obstruction from the building on the corner of the intersection may have contributed to the driver's failure to see the red light and the approaching vehicles.
