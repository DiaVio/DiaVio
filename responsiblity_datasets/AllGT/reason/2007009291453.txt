The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 turned left into the path of V2 (the 1993 Dodge Intrepid sedan) while V2 was traveling straight through the intersection. V1 had been waiting in the left turn lane for over three minutes and proceeded to turn left when the light turned green. However, V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and did not yield the right of way to V2. This resulted in V1 striking the left side of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that the headlight glare from surrounding traffic concealed the approach of V2. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to make a left turn before proceeding, regardless of any environmental factors such as glare. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
