The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the right side of Vehicle 1, causing the deployment of airbags and subsequent rotation and trajectory of Vehicle 1. Vehicle 2 was proceeding straight on the roadway while Vehicle 1 was attempting to turn left, indicating that Vehicle 2 had the right of way. Additionally, the presence of a northbound vehicle blocking the view of both drivers further suggests that Vehicle 2 was not able to see Vehicle 1 and therefore failed to yield.
