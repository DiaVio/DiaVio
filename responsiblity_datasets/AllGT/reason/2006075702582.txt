The driver of V1 failed to stop for the traffic that was stopped in front of them, resulting in a rear-end collision with V2 (the Honda Civic), which then caused V2 to collide with V3 (the Chevrolet Geo Prizm). The driver of V1 stated that she noticed the road construction and saw that the cars had stopped in front of her, but she was unable to stop in time. The critical reason for the critical event in V1 was coded as a driver-related factor - external distraction, with associated factors of inadequate surveillance and failure to look far enough ahead. This suggests that the driver of V1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and the traffic conditions, leading to the failure to stop in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop for the stopped traffic and the associated factors of inadequate surveillance and external distraction.
