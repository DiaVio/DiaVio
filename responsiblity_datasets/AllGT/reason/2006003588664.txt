The reason for this is that the driver of V2 stated that he thought the taxi (V1) was about to perform a U-turn and steered to avoid it. This indicates a performance error of poor directional control on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, an associated factor was the presence of alcohol, as the driver of V2 had an alcohol odor about him when interviewed. These factors suggest that the driver of V2 was not fully in control of his vehicle and made an incorrect assumption about the intentions of the taxi, leading to the collision.
