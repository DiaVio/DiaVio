The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 was crossing the intersection and encroached into the path of V1, resulting in the collision. Since V2 was the vehicle that encroached into the path of another vehicle, it indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Therefore, V2 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
