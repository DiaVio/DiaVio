The reasons for this are as follows: 1. V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, as indicated by the length of its skid marks. This suggests that V1 was exceeding the posted speed limit, making it difficult to respond to unexpected actions of others. 2. The V1 driver had a Blood Alcohol Level of 0.141, which is above the legal limit for driving. This impaired the driver's judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. 3. There were reports of a hit and run collision involving V1 prior to this crash, indicating a pattern of reckless behavior. These factors combined demonstrate that V1 was driving at an excessive speed, possibly without headlights on, and under the influence of alcohol. These actions significantly contributed to the collision and make V1 primarily responsible.
