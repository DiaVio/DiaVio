The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline and travel towards the left pavement edge, ultimately resulting in the vehicle departing the pavement and impacting the back slope of a ditch. This initial impact caused the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and initiate a rollover sequence, leading to severe top damage. The driver of Vehicle 1 was also ejected during the rollover, indicating a lack of control and negligence on their part.
