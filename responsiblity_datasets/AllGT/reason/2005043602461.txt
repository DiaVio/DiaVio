The driver of V1 admitted that it was his fault and that he did not know what he was thinking. He failed to see the vehicle in front of him slowing down or stopping, which led to him locking his brakes and swerving to the right, ultimately causing the crash. The critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as inattention, indicating that the driver was not paying enough attention to the road. Additionally, the driver's use of prescription medication and the narrow shoulders of the roadway were associated factors that may have contributed to the accident.
