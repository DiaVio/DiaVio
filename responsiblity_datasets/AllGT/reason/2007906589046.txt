The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the on-scene witness stated that V2 was speeding and did not stop at the red light. This information is supported by the Critical Pre-crash Event for V2, which indicates that V2 crossed over or passed through the intersection. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event is listed as "unknown reason for critical event" but driver-related, with associated factors including an illegal maneuver and failure to stop at a traffic control device. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the red light and their illegal maneuver of crossing the intersection led to the collision with V1.
