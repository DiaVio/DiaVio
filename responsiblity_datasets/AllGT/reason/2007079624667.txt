The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the fact that V1 went to the right side of the travel lane, contacted both the east and west curbs, and subsequently collided with multiple objects on private properties. The driver's unfamiliarity with the road, discomfort with the narrowness of the roadway, and lack of driving experience could have contributed to her poor control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's medical conditions, including an enlarged heart and sleepwalking while eating, as well as the use of multiple medications, may have impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle.
