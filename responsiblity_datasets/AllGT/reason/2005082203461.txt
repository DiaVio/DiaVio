The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was making an illegal left turn, despite clear signs indicating no left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the turn, as evidenced by the driver's statement that they didn't see V2 until the crash was imminent. The sight line restriction caused by the construction of the overhead bridge may have contributed to the driver's failure to see V2, but ultimately, it was the driver's responsibility to ensure it was safe to make the turn. The passenger in V1 even warned the driver against making the illegal left turn.
