The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions. The roadway was downhill and curved to the right, which would require extra caution and reduced speed. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation after swerving to avoid the stopped vehicles likely contributed to the loss of control. The police report states that the driver swerved right and then left, indicating a lack of control and stability. Overall, V1's excessive speed and failure to adapt to the road conditions were the main factors leading to the crash.
