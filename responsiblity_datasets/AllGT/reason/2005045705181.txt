The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to disregarding the stop sign and not noticing it or slowing down. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the area and had never been on that road before, which may have contributed to her failure to notice the stop sign. While there were some associated factors such as the driver taking antidepressants and wearing bifocal lenses, these factors alone do not absolve the driver of responsibility for disregarding the stop sign. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that she saw the other vehicle and assumed it would stop at the stop sign. Although she was traveling slightly above the speed limit, her reaction time was limited and she attempted to brake and steer left at impact. Overall, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle #1 for failing to stop at the stop sign and causing the collision.
