The driver of V1 made several critical errors that led to the crash. Firstly, she was distracted by a phone call and hung up just before the exit she needed. This internal distraction caused her to miss the exit sign and continue driving past the safe exiting point. Secondly, she turned from the wrong lane and attempted to cross the gore area to get into the exit lane. This poor directional control and inadequate surveillance contributed to the loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's emotional state and concerns about personal relationships may have further impaired her ability to focus on the road. Furthermore, the driver admitted to not wearing her corrective lenses, which could have impaired her vision and contributed to the poor decision-making and lack of awareness of the correct exit. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the combination of distracted driving, poor directional control, inadequate surveillance, emotional state, and impaired vision.
