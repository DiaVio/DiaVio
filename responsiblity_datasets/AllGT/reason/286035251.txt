The reason for this is that V1 lost control and began to spin out of control while entering a left curve in the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle under the given road and weather conditions. Additionally, it is mentioned that none of the three occupants in V1 were wearing their seatbelts at the time of the crash, which could have contributed to the severity of their injuries.
