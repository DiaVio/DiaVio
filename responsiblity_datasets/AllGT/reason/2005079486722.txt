The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound and entered the intersection when the traffic light had already turned red. Although V2 attempted to brake when he saw V1 beginning to turn, he was unable to slow down enough to avoid the collision. This indicates that V2 was not following the traffic signal and made an illegal maneuver by entering the intersection on a red light.
