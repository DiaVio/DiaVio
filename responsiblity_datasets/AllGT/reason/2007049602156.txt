The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling at a high rate of speed in lane two and attempted to pass V2 (the Toyota Tercel) on the right by entering lane one. This action resulted in V1's front striking the right side of V2, initiating the chain of collisions. Additionally, V1 continued to drive partially in lane two and lane one after the first impact, ultimately striking the left side of V4 (the unidentified vehicle) before leaving the scene. V1's actions of driving at a high rate of speed, attempting to pass on the right, and failing to maintain control of their vehicle were the critical factors that led to the crash.
