The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 when exiting out of a driveway and attempting a left turn onto the roadway. - V1's view of oncoming traffic was blocked by the B-pillar, indicating inadequate surveillance. - Witness #1 reported that V1 smelled of alcohol and attempted to buy alcohol before entering the roadway. - Blood tests conducted at the hospital revealed that V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .15, which is above the legal limit. - V1 also tested positive for cocaine and benzodiazepines, indicating drug use. - Other associated factors for V1 include fatigue, inattention, aggressive driving, and unfamiliarity with the roadway. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way, impaired driving, and multiple associated factors make them primarily responsible for the crash.
