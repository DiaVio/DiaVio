The driver of V1 was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed, indicating that safety measures were in place. However, the severe right-side impact with the pole resulted in the driver moving inboard and forward relative to the vehicle interior. This movement likely contributed to the various injuries sustained by the driver, including the central forehead laceration, frontal bone fracture, brain hemorrhage, and other head injuries. The injuries, such as the lacerations, contusions, and fractures, are likely a result of contact with the intruding right roof side rail and possibly the pole. The abrasions on the right wrist, hand, thigh, and shin are also likely due to contact with different parts of the vehicle interior. Therefore, based on the information provided, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
