The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Honda Accord) which was traveling on the northbound lane with no traffic controls. V1 had a stop sign posted and should have stopped and waited for V2 to pass before entering the intersection. However, V1 entered the intersection without sufficient clearance, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene of the crash, which further indicates their responsibility for the accident.
