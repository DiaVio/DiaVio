The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to steer left to avoid a deer but still struck it, causing the vehicle to enter the southbound travel lane. The driver then attempted to brake but ultimately lost control of the vehicle, resulting in multiple impacts with the embankment, a small tree, and a larger tree. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the subsequent collisions indicates primary responsibility.
