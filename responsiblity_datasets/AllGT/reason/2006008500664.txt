The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver's inadequate surveillance of the scene. The critical precrash event, which involved V1 traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicates that the driver did not properly scan the area around her to react to the parked vehicle. This lack of surveillance led to the collision with the rear of the parked vehicle, resulting in the subsequent rotation and tripping of V1.
