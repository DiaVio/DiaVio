The driver of V1 was traveling in the number two lane when a non-contact vehicle traveling in the same direction in lane one changed lanes to the left. Instead of applying the brakes to avoid a collision, the driver of V1 swerved to the left, causing the vehicle to travel into the southbound lanes and collide with V2 (the Jeep Commander). The driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control and overcompensation, which were associative factors in the collision.
