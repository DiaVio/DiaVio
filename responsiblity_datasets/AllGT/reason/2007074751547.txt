The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by talking to his passengers and looking down at the speedometer right before the crash. When he looked back at the roadway, he realized that V2 (the 1996 Mack RD600 garbage truck) was slowing down, but it was too late for him to react in time and he ended up rear-ending V2. Additionally, V1 was not wearing his required corrective lenses at the time of the crash, which could have impaired his vision and contributed to the accident. While V2 was also cited for traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to his distracted driving and failure to react in a timely manner.
