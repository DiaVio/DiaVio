The driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .031, which indicates that he had consumed alcohol while driving. This impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely and contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted to only having slept for 2 Â½ hours after working a night shift, which likely resulted in fatigue and decreased alertness while driving. Furthermore, the driver's lack of knowledge about the road, combined with the wet conditions, may have contributed to his overcompensation when he drifted onto the left shoulder. This overcorrection caused V1 to cross multiple lanes and ultimately crash into trees. Overall, the driver's impaired state, lack of sleep, and overcompensation were the primary factors that led to the accident.
