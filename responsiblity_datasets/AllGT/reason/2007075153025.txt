The driver of V1 failed to observe and disregarded the red light, which indicates a clear violation of traffic rules. Additionally, the investigating officer reported that V1 engaged in aggressive driving and ignored the traffic control. These actions demonstrate a lack of attention and responsibility on the part of the driver of V1, leading to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2004 Jeep Liberty) was stopped northbound in lane one, in preparation to turn left. The driver of V2 stated that she looked but did not see anyone coming before entering the intersection to turn left. While V2 may have had an inadequate surveillance, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for disregarding the red light and engaging in aggressive driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to observe and disregard the red light, as well as engaging in aggressive driving.
