The reason for this is that Vehicle # 2 was traveling westbound on a one-way roadway controlled by a stop sign. The driver of Vehicle # 2 stated that he did not see Vehicle # 1 when he entered the intersection. The Critical Pre-crash event for Vehicle # 2 was coded as "This vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection" and the Critical Reason for the Critical event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically an illegal maneuver. The associated factors coded to the driver were both recognition factors - he was conversing with the passenger and had inadequate surveillance, as he looked but did not see Vehicle # 1. Therefore, based on the driver's illegal maneuver and failure to adequately observe the intersection, Vehicle # 2 is primarily responsible for the crash.
