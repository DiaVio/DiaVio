The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn from the center painted turn lane, which indicates an intention to turn across oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the Buick LeSabre) was traveling in the first lane of the eastbound direction and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and turned into the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 was not licensed and had only been driving for a very short distance. This lack of experience and proper licensing may have contributed to the driver's false assumption of the other vehicle's actions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their false assumption of the other vehicle's actions.
