The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was attempting to negotiate a left turn maneuver from the private driveway onto the north/south trafficway. However, the driver failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1983 Datsun 720 pickup, which was traveling southbound with the intention of continuing straight through the junction. As a result, V1 entered the path of V2, causing a near-side collision at a ten o'clock principal direction of force impact. The failure of the driver of V1 to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn maneuver is the primary reason for the accident.
