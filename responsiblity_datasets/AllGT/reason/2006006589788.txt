The driver of Vehicle 1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to see Vehicle 2 (2002 Cadillac Escalade) approaching from the opposite direction. The driver of Vehicle 1 mentioned that the glare from a police car parked on the northeast corner with its lights on obstructed her vision, causing her to collide with Vehicle 2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was traveling 10 mph over the posted speed limit. Reason: Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 while making a left turn, resulting in the collision. The driver's claim of glare from the police car's lights does not absolve her of responsibility, as drivers are expected to exercise caution and ensure the intersection is clear before making a turn. Furthermore, exceeding the speed limit may have contributed to the severity of the crash.
