The reason for V1's responsibility is that it experienced a blowout due to a large nail in its right front tire. This caused V1 to lose control and depart the roadway, ultimately impacting a fence. The driver's delusional problem and claims of a bomb in the car are not supported by any evidence and do not contribute to the cause of the crash. The critical pre-crash event and critical reason for V1 were both related to the tire failure, indicating that the condition of the vehicle's tires was a significant factor in the accident.
