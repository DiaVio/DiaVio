The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection without a protected left turn arrow. Despite knowing that the left turn was not protected, V1 proceeded with the turn based on the assumption that the oncoming traffic was still stopped. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not consider the possibility of a vehicle approaching from the unoccupied lane 2. This lack of attention and failure to consider all potential hazards led to the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 2001 Dodge Neon) was traveling at a high speed and may have encroached over the left lane line, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not exercising proper surveillance and making an unsafe left turn.
