The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the red traffic signal and collided with the right side of V2 (the 2001 Honda Accord sedan). V1 also failed to look to his left to recognize that V2 had already entered the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 was arrested for DUI, indicating that they were driving under the influence of alcohol, which likely impaired their judgment and ability to operate the vehicle safely.
