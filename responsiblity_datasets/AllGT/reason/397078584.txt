The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed from the trafficway into the center median, continued northbound in the grass median, and ultimately collided with multiple trees. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining control of the vehicle and veered off the designated travel lanes, resulting in the subsequent collisions with the trees.
