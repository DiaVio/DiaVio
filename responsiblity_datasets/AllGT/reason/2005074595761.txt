The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection." The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that the driver of V2 failed to adequately observe the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with V1 (the 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass) and subsequently V3 (the 2004 Mazda 6). Therefore, V2's failure to properly survey the intersection and proceed with caution is the primary reason for the crash.
