The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) in a construction zone where the posted speed limit was 40 kph (25 mph). Additionally, V1 failed to negotiate the sharp left curve and veered off the traffic lane, ultimately colliding with the barricades and concrete barrier wall. Furthermore, the driver of V1 admitted that she was probably going too fast and was not fully focused on the driving task due to being fatigued and distracted by personal issues. This indicates a recognition error and inattention on the part of the driver, which contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to speeding, failure to negotiate the curve, and driver inattention.
