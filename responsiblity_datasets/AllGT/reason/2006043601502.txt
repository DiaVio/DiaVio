The driver of V2 admits that her view was obstructed by other vehicles parked near the intersection, which could have prevented her from seeing V1 approaching. Additionally, V2 was the vehicle crossing over the intersection, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Therefore, V2's failure to properly assess the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic, combined with the obstructed view, makes V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
