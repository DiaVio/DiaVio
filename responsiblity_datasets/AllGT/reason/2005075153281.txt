The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the sharp left curve on the road. This is evident from the fact that V1 left skid marks and departed the roadway, swerved to the left, and made contact with multiple trees, a ditch embankment, and a large rock before coming to rest. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of V1 was 56 kmph, which is higher than the advised speed of 40 kmph for the curve.
