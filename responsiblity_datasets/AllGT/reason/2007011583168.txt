The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a low blood sugar episode, which impaired his ability to act and control the vehicle. This critical non-performance error led to V1 drifting off the road, striking mailboxes and trees, and ultimately causing the accident. Additionally, the driver had a history of crashes caused by low sugar episodes and had just gotten his license back after a suspension for previous incidents. The driver's poor health, including diabetes, dementia, and kidney dialysis, as well as his extensive use of medications, further contributed to his impaired driving ability.
