The driver of V1 reported feeling fatigued at the start of his day, which could have impaired his alertness and reaction time. Additionally, he stated that he felt the vehicle starting to slide as he accelerated up the ramp, indicating that he may have been traveling too fast for the road conditions. Despite recognizing the slide, he continued to tap the brakes, which likely contributed to the vehicle's rotation and subsequent collision with the retainer wall. While the road conditions, specifically the presence of black ice, played a role in the crash, the driver's actions and decisions ultimately led to the loss of control and the subsequent rollover of the vehicle.
