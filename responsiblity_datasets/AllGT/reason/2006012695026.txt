The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that he looked but did not see V2 (the 1987 Chevrolet Corvette) before attempting to change lanes. This indicates that V1's driver failed to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, an associated factor was the view obstruction related to the vehicle design, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to see V2. On the other hand, V2's driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash and was not coded with any critical reason for the pre-crash event. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
