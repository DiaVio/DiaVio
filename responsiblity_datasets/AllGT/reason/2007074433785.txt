The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver-related factor of the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and crossed into the opposite lane, resulting in the collision with V2 (the parked 1997 Buick LeSabre). Additionally, the driver's high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) reading of .302, which is significantly above the legal limit, suggests impaired judgment and decision-making, further contributing to the driver's responsibility for the crash.
