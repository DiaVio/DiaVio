The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the Toyota Camry). The driver mistakenly thought that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction and preparing to turn left in front of him. As a result, the driver of V1 braked and steered to the right, directly into V2, causing the collision. This false assumption and the subsequent inappropriate and unsuccessful actions taken by the driver of V1 led to the accident.
