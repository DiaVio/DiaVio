The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 48 kmph (30 mph), which was too fast for the curve/turn on the roadway. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced and unfamiliar with the vehicle, as it was the first time he had driven it. The driver's alcohol consumption also contributed to the crash.
