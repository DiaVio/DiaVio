The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the 1996 Buick Regal) at the T-intersection, resulting in the front of V1 striking the rear of V2. - This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, which is a basic rule of the road. - The impact caused V2 to be pushed forward and to the left, resulting in V2 coming to rest facing east in the westbound lane. - After the initial collision, V1 continued traveling for a significant distance of approximately 580m (1903ft.) before losing control and traveling off the roadway. - V1 then returned to the roadway, crossed four lanes of travel, and came to rest partially off the roadway on the westbound side. - The fact that V1 lost control and traveled off the roadway indicates a lack of control and proper driving technique. - Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .24, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. - The presence of alcohol in the driver's system further supports the conclusion that V1 was not driving responsibly and may have been impaired at the time of the crash. Therefore, based on the given information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to stop, lack of control, and the presence of alcohol in the driver's system.
