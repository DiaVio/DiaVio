The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was making a left turn from the left turn lane without yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, the 1997 International medium/heavy dump truck, was traveling straight through the intersection with no traffic controls for north and south directions. V2 began braking with lockup skid marks prior to the intersection, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. However, V1 failed to yield the right of way and turned into the path of V2, resulting in the impact on the left side of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and turning into the path of oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
