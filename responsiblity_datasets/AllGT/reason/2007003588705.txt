The driver of V2 admitted to inadequate surveillance, stating that she looked but didn't see the oncoming truck. Additionally, the driver mentioned that she rarely drives on this roadway, indicating a lack of familiarity with the intersection. The fact that she was wearing non-prescription sunglasses and experienced sun glare further suggests that her visibility may have been compromised. Therefore, V2's failure to properly observe the oncoming vehicle and take appropriate action to avoid the collision makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
