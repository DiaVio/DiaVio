The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, V1 failed to look to the side ahead and panicked, contributing to the collision. The fact that V1 was allegedly trying to avoid a vehicle that had previously struck them does not absolve them of responsibility for the crash.
