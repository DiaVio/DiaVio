The driver of V1 admitted to experiencing symptoms of PTSD while driving, including blurred vision, nausea, sweating, and light-headedness. He claimed to have become disoriented and swerved on the road, ultimately crossing into the opposing lane of travel and colliding with V2. These symptoms and actions indicate that the driver of V1 was impaired and unable to safely operate his vehicle. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was traveling over the left lane line, further supporting the driver's failure to maintain proper control of his vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impairment and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
