The reason for V1's responsibility is that a witness at the scene reported that V1 did not stop at the red light at all. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic signal and proceeded into the intersection without the right of way. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as an unknown recognition error, suggesting that V1 may have been inattentive or not aware of the traffic signal. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2000 Honda Civic) claimed to have a green light and was passing through the intersection. There is no indication of any critical reason coded for V2, suggesting that V2 was following the traffic laws and had the right of way. Therefore, based on the witness account and the fact that V1 failed to stop at the red light, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
