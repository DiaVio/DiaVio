The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the centerline and sideswiped the left front corner of Vehicle 2 (V2). This indicates that V1 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 continued across the oncoming travel lane, exited the roadway, and impacted a fence and utility pole, further demonstrating a lack of control. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the available seat belt, which is a violation of safety regulations. This lack of restraint may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the case occupant in V1. Overall, the actions of V1, including crossing the centerline and failing to maintain control, along with the driver's failure to use a seat belt, make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
