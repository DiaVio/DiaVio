The reason for this is that V1 took incorrect evasive action when something darted out in the roadway. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle, V1 overcompensated by steering to the left and then right, causing the vehicle to lose traction and rotate clockwise. This ultimately led to V1 departing the roadway and colliding with a dirt embankment. Additionally, V1's poor directional control and the wet roadway due to rain were contributing factors to the collision. V1 should have exercised more caution and adjusted their driving behavior to the road conditions, especially considering the limited visibility and wet surface. However, it is important to note that the driver's pre-crash factors are mostly unknown, as they were not available for further interview. This limits our understanding of any potential additional factors that may have influenced the collision.
