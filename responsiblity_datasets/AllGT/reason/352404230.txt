The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 noticed the stopped Vehicle 2 in the right northbound travel lane and attempted to avoid a collision by braking and steering left. However, the driver was unsuccessful in avoiding the collision and the right side of Vehicle 1 struck the back left corner of the tanker unit. This initial impact caused Vehicle 1 to yaw/rotate and ultimately resulted in the vehicle overturning and rolling multiple times. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 1, including the failure to successfully avoid the collision and the subsequent loss of control leading to the rollover, indicate that Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
