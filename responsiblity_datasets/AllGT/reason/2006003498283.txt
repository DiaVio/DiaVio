The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a potentially dangerous maneuver. V1 (the Nissan Maxima) was traveling straight in the right lane and had the right of way. V2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and turned in front of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V2 fled the scene after the crash suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability.
