The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was not prepared for the sun glare and failed to see V2 and V3 stopped in lane one. Despite attempting to apply the brakes at the last second, V1 still collided with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction that resulted in the collision between V2 and V3. The driver's failure to anticipate and react to the sun glare, as well as the distraction caused by adjusting the sun visor, contributed to the accident.
