The driver of V1 admitted to running the stop sign on the north side of the intersection. He stated that he forgot that the east/west traffic did not have to stop. This indicates a driver decision error and an illegal maneuver. On the other hand, V2 (the Chevrolet Trailblazer) was traveling westbound and entered the intersection without any traffic controls present. The sun glare was present for the driver of V2, but this does not absolve V1 of responsibility for failing to stop at the stop sign. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running the stop sign and making an illegal maneuver.
