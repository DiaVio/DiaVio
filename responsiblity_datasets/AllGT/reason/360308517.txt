The reason for this is that V2 was traveling east in lane one on the intersecting street and collided with the left side of V1, which was in the northbound lane intending to make a left turn at the intersection. V2 attempted to brake and steer left, but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the crash.
