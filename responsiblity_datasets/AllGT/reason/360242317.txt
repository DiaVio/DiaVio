The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn into a driveway just behind V3, the parked truck. V2's front left impacted the front left of V1, the 2004 Hyundai Elantra sedan. V2 then rotated counterclockwise, causing the front of V2 to impact the left side of V1. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
