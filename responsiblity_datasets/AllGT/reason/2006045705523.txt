The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling north in lane three and encountered V2, which was stopped in lane three waiting to turn left. - V1 applied the brakes and skidded into the back of V2, indicating a failure to maintain a safe following distance and react in time to the stopped vehicle. - V1's driver was found to be inattentive and fatigued, with inadequate surveillance, as she failed to look far enough ahead. - The driver of V1 was also preoccupied with personal matters and in a hurry to get to her dialysis appointment and visit her terminally ill husband. - The fact that V1's airbags did not deploy due to the driver's seat position suggests that the driver may not have been properly positioned for safe driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention, fatigue, inadequate surveillance, and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
