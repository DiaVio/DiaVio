The reason for this is that V3, the driver of the Ford F150, traveled over the left lane line into the oncoming lane of traffic, causing V2 to take evasive action and ultimately resulting in the collision between V2 and V1. V3's failure to reduce speed as it approached V1 and its subsequent swerving across the roadway indicates a lack of control and awareness, making V3 primarily responsible for the crash.
