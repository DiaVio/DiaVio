The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was in the left turn lane and intended to turn left at the intersection. However, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and Vehicle 2's frontal plane struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
