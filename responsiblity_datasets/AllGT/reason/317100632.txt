The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a significantly higher speed than the posted speed limit, reportedly at approximately 137 kph (85 mph) in a 72 kph (45 mph) zone. Additionally, V1 crossed the center line and departed the left side of the roadway, indicating a loss of control. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and excessive speed are key factors in determining V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
