The driver of V1 crossed over the centerline into the eastbound lanes, causing a sideswipe collision with V2 (the 1998 Volkswagen Golf). After the initial collision, V1 continued traveling in the wrong direction and struck V3 (the 1994 Toyota P/U). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle within the travel lane. The driver's poor directional control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected led to the critical event. The driver's attention being focused on a vehicle in the adjacent travel lane may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and crossing into the opposite lanes of traffic.
