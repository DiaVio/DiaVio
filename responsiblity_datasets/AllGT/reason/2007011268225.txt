The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 encroached over the left lane line, causing the collision with V1. V2 stated that he did not have time to take any avoidance actions and never saw V1 until it was too late. However, V2 had a green light and was traveling at or near the posted speed limit, indicating that he had the right of way. V2 should have been aware of the possibility of vehicles turning left across his path and should have been prepared to yield or take appropriate action to avoid a collision. Therefore, V2's failure to yield to V1 and encroaching over the left lane line makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
