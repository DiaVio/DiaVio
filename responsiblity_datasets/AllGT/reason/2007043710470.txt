The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included wet roads and inadequate tire tread depth. Additionally, the driver reported experiencing steering problems and discomfort with the handling of the vehicle in the rain. These factors indicate that the driver failed to exercise caution and adjust their driving behavior accordingly, leading to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the concrete bridge support.
