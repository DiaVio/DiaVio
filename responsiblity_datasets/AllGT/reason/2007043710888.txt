The driver of V1 was intoxicated, having been drinking at a local bar before getting behind the wheel. This impaired his judgment and decision-making abilities. Additionally, he was driving at a high speed of over 112 kph (70 mph), which was too fast for the curve/turn on the downhill, curved left stretch of roadway. The driver admitted to wanting to test the power and handling of the high-end Mercedes, but he was unfamiliar with the vehicle's capabilities. Furthermore, the driver was distracted by talking to his passengers and listening to loud music, which could have affected his focus and reaction time. The narrow paved shoulders of the roadway, only 0.5 meters (1.64 feet) wide, may have also contributed to the driver's inability to safely re-enter the roadway after initially departing to the right. In summary, the driver's impaired state, excessive speed, lack of familiarity with the vehicle, distractions, and the narrow shoulders all played a role in causing the accident. Therefore, Vehicle One (V1) is primarily responsible for the crash.
