The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 stated that he could not remember what had happened and that he suffers from Obstructive Sleep Apnea. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: sleeping, that is, actually asleep. Therefore, it can be concluded that the driver of V1 falling asleep at the wheel due to his sleep apnea condition was the primary cause of the crash.
