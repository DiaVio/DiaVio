The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn in front of oncoming traffic (V2) without adequately surveilling the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 prior to turning left, indicating a failure to properly observe the approaching traffic. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance is the critical reason for the collision.
