The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted off the right edge of the roadway while negotiating a left turning curve, resulting in it slipping down a slight embankment and colliding with two trees. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, leading to the collision.
