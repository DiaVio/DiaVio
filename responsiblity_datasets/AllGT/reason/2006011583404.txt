The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic (V2) while making a left turn at the intersection. V1 stated that he was distracted by the movements of V3, which caused him to swing wider around V3 and take more time to complete his turn. This distraction, combined with the heavy traffic flow and the wet road conditions, contributed to V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn.
