The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to poor directional control, which can be attributed to several factors. These factors include the driver's inexperience, as they had only been driving for three months, their unfamiliarity with the roadway, and their lack of comfort with the handling of the vehicle on slick roads. Additionally, driving too fast for the wet conditions and a possible mechanical problem with the vehicle's steering may have also contributed to the cause of the crash.
