The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted and failed to observe Vehicle #2 turning left. The driver and passenger were arguing prior to the crash, indicating an internal distraction. Additionally, the driver was taking prescription medications with possible side effects of sleepiness, inability to concentrate, and blackouts. The fact that the driver stated to EMS personnel that he had possibly blacked out and had just taken a tranquilizer prior to the crash further supports the conclusion that the driver's distraction and medication use contributed to the accident.
