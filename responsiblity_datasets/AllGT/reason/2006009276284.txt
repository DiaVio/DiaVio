The driver of V1 was distracted by drinking a protein drink while driving, which is a driver-related factor and an internal distraction. This distraction likely caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle and depart from the roadway, ultimately resulting in the collision with the utility pole. Additionally, poor directional control was coded as an associated factor, indicating that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
