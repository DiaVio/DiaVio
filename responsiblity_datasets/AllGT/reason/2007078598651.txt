The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle after the left rear tire tread separated. The driver's attempt to steer right and brake in order to exit the road resulted in a loss of control, causing the vehicle to travel across the roadway and ultimately roll over. The driver's poor directional control and unsuccessful actions to control the vehicle after the tire tread separation contributed to the accident.
