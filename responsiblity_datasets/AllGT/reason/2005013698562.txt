The reason for V1's responsibility is that she was distracted and not paying attention to the road. She admitted to looking down at directions and talking with her son, which caused her to miss the red light and collide with V2 (the driver of the 2003 Chevy Impala). V1's internal distraction and failure to apply the brakes in time to avoid the collision indicate her primary responsibility for the accident.
