The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2, which had the right of way and was proceeding straight through the intersection. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and turned in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not located for an interview, which suggests a lack of cooperation or potential negligence on their part.
