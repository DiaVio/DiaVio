The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to partially depart the right pavement edge, re-directed the vehicle back onto the roadway, and then crossed the travel lanes towards the left pavement edge. Vehicle 1 subsequently departed the west pavement edge and entered a ravine, resulting in multiple impacts with brush, a ditch, and an adjacent tree. The lack of restraint use by the driver is also evident. Therefore, the driver's actions and lack of control over Vehicle 1 led to the accident, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible.
