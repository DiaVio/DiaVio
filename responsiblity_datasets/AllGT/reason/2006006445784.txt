The reason for this is that the driver provided an inaccurate description of the crash, claiming to have been rear-ended by a hit and run vehicle when in fact he had a previous crash earlier that evening. The driver's attempt to leave the scene and his unwillingness to disclose the true events suggest that he was trying to avoid explaining his presence in the area of the original crash. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was when it traveled off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that the driver was going too fast for the curve.
