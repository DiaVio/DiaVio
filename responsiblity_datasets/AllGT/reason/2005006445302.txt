The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, as indicated by the Critical Precrash Event coded as "inadequate surveillance (failed to look far enough ahead)." This suggests that the driver of V1 did not pay enough attention to the road conditions and the presence of other vehicles, leading to the rear-end collision with V2. Additionally, V2 (the 1999 Ford F-350 pick-up) was traveling at a consistent speed of approximately 64 kmph (40 mph), which indicates that V2 was not at fault for suddenly stopping or causing the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain proper surveillance and avoid a rear-end collision.
