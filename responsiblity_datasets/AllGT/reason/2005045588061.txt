The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by driving too fast for the wet road conditions. This decision error led to a performance error of overcompensation when the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. Additionally, the driver admitted to being in a hurry to reach her destination by a certain time, which likely contributed to her decision to drive at a higher speed than was safe for the conditions. Furthermore, it is mentioned that it was the driver's first time on the roadway, indicating a lack of familiarity with the road's characteristics and potential hazards. This lack of experience may have also played a role in the driver's inability to properly navigate the curve and control the vehicle. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to drive too fast for the wet conditions, overcompensation during the loss of control, and lack of experience on the roadway.
