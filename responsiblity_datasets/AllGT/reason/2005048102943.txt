The driver of V1 indicated that traffic suddenly stopped and she did not have time to brake. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the stopped vehicles ahead. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically an unknown recognition error. This further supports the notion that the driver of V1 was at fault for not recognizing the stopped vehicles and taking appropriate action to avoid the collision.
