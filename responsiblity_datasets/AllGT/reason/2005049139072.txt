The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn without the right of way, and was struck by V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) who was traveling in the opposite direction and had the right of way. V1's inadequate surveillance, specifically failing to look far enough to the right, resulted in the collision.
