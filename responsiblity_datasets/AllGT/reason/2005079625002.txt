The reason for V1's primary responsibility is attributed to the following factors: 1. V1 veered right to avoid a non-contact vehicle entering the second lane, which caused V1 to enter the parking lane and collide with the air-compressor trailer of V2. 2. The driver of V1 was arrested for theft and unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, indicating potential impairment or illegal activity. 3. The critical reason for the crash was coded as a driver-related performance error of overcompensation, suggesting that V1's actions contributed to the collision. 4. The primary cause of the crash listed on the police report was DUI on the part of the driver of V1, indicating that alcohol or drug impairment played a role in the collision. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
