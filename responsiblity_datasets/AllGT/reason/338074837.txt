The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the road edge and enter the shoulder, resulting in the collision with the ditch. This initial impact caused moderate damage to the front left area of the vehicle. Subsequently, the vehicle struck the hillside with the front right area, causing additional moderate damage. The embankment's super elevation then caused the vehicle to rotate and initiate a left side rollover, resulting in minor top damage. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the roadway.
