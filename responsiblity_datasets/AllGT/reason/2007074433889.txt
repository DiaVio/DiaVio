The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2. This is indicated by the critical pre-crash event for V1 being coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, the fact that V1's right side was struck by the front of V2 suggests that V1 turned left in front of oncoming traffic, failing to yield the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
