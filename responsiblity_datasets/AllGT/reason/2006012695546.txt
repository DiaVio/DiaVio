The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the Freightliner Semi) when it was stopped in lane one, preparing to turn right onto an intersecting roadway. V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down at something in his vehicle prior to the crash. When he looked back up, he saw the truck stopped in front of him and was unable to avoid the collision. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as an internal distraction, indicating that the driver's failure to pay attention to the road was a contributing factor to the accident. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in lane one and did not take any avoidance actions. While V2 was in V1's blind spot, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not maintaining a safe distance and failing to stop in time to avoid the collision.
