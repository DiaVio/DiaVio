The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were attempting to turn left into a private driveway, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the Toyota MR2) was traveling in the opposite direction in the correct lane (number one lane) and did not encroach into V1's lane. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 rotated clockwise until contacting the north curb and continued rotating onto the sidewalk, ultimately colliding with a traffic barrier post and a wooden fence. This suggests that V1's turn was not executed properly, causing them to lose control of their vehicle. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while turning left make them primarily responsible for the collision.
