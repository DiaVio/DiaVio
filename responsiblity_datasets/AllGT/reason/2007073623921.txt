The reason for this is that V1 was entering the roadway from a driveway and turning right, but failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she looked left but did not see V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Malibu) approaching in lane one. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was distracted by family concerns, which could have further contributed to her inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
