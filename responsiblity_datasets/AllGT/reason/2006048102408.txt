The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 traveled off the right side of the road, overcompensated by steering left, and then steered right, causing the vehicle to rotate and enter the opposing lane of travel. This sequence of actions ultimately led to the collision with V2 (the 2006 Ford Focus). The driver's inexperience with the vehicle, as it was her first time driving it and she stated feeling uncomfortable, likely contributed to her overcompensation and loss of control. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, and the critical reason was not coded to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's overcompensation and lack of experience with the vehicle.
