The driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.306 after the crash, indicating a significantly high level of alcohol consumption. Additionally, the driver had just been given a Dilaudid prior to the interview, which could have further impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs at the time of the crash, which likely contributed to his poor directional control and failure to maintain his lane of travel. Furthermore, the report states that V1 departed the roadway on the left and impacted the concrete barrier, rebounding and traveling back into the lane where V2 was traveling. This indicates that V1's initial departure from the roadway was the critical pre-crash event, and the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the subsequent collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired state, poor directional control, and failure to maintain the lane of travel.
