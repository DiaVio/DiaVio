The reason for Vehicle 1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was distracted by looking at a home under construction and failed to recognize that Vehicle 2 (the 2003 GMC Sierra K2500 HD pickup truck) was slowing down. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 made a false assumption that Vehicle 2 would continue to proceed without slowing down. These factors contributed to the driver of Vehicle 1 not being able to react in time and ultimately colliding with the back of Vehicle 2.
