The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of approximately 35-40 mph, which is well over the posted speed limit of 15 mph for the roadway. Additionally, V1 was negotiating a left curve and crossed over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The driver's excessive speed and failure to stay within the lane contributed to the collision with V2. V2 (the 1990 Buick Park Avenue) also had a critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, but the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by slowing down and steering as far to the right of the roadway as possible, but was unable to avoid the impact. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed and failure to stay within the lane, while V2 made efforts to avoid the collision but was unable to do so.
