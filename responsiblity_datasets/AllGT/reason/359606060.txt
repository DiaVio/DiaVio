The reason for this is that the driver of V1 drifted over the left lane line and impacted a large overpass bridge support column, resulting in minor sideswipe damage. This initial impact caused V1 to go into a clockwise rotation and begin to rollover, ultimately resulting in the serious injuries sustained by both occupants.
