The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver had a seizure just prior to the crash, which caused him to travel off the right side of the roadway and strike the metal power pole. The driver's seizure and resulting physical impairment of the ability to act led to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent crash.
