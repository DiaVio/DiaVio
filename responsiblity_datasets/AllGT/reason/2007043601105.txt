The reason for this is that V2, while negotiating a curve to the left, drove off the right side of the road and then re-entered the roadway, ultimately entering the southbound lane and striking V1 head-on. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as too fast for the curve, reason unknown. This indicates that V2 was driving at an excessive speed for the curve, which caused them to lose control of their vehicle and cross into the opposite lane, resulting in the head-on collision with V1.
