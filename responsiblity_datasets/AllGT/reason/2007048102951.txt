The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is considered a critical pre-crash event. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that the driver of V1 made an error while turning left, although the specific details of the error are not provided. Therefore, based on the information given, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
