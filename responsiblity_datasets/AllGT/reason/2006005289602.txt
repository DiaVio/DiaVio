The driver of V1 was intending to make a left turn at the intersection and proceeded to do so when the light turned yellow. However, she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. She looked for oncoming traffic but did not see any, which indicates inadequate surveillance. As a result, V1 collided with V2 (the 1996 Cadillac Deville) that was heading east in lane two, intending to continue straight through the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance while making a left turn.
