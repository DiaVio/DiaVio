The driver of V1 stopped prior to initiating the left turn and saw V2 approaching. However, they mistakenly thought V2 was in the right-hand turn lane and proceeded with the left turn. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver of V1 to accurately assess the situation and properly yield the right of way to V2. While the driver of V2 initially assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, they realized that V1 was continuing the left turn and attempted to swerve to the right to avoid the collision. This suggests that the driver of V2 reacted appropriately given the circumstances. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the collision lies with the driver of V1 due to their failure to yield the right of way and accurately assess the situation before making the left turn.
