The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 became fatigued, fell asleep, and relinquished control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 drifting to the left, crossing the centerline, and ultimately rolling over in a private parking lot. The driver's fatigue and falling asleep directly contributed to the loss of control and subsequent accident.
