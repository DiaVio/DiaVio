The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and struck the back of V2, initiating the chain reaction of collisions. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle in lane stopped" and the Critical Reason for the event was coded as "following too closely to respond to unexpected actions." This indicates that V1 was not able to respond in time to the stopped vehicles ahead, suggesting that the driver was not maintaining a safe following distance. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
