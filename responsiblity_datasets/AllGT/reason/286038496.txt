The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 had an adverse health event, causing him to momentarily lose consciousness. This loss of consciousness resulted in V1 drifting across the centerline, onto the sidewalk, and ultimately colliding with various objects before coming to a rest. The driver's loss of consciousness and subsequent inability to control the vehicle led to the accident.
