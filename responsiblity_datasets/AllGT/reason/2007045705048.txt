The driver of V1 admitted to making a false assumption that V2 (the 1995 Jeep Cherokee) was going to merge into westbound traffic. This false assumption led to V1 rear-ending V2 at the foot of the ramp. The driver of V1 reported that she saw V2 but thought it was slowing down and still in motion. Additionally, she was distracted by looking to her left and rearward to monitor approaching traffic on the secondary arterial road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption and distraction while approaching the intersection.
