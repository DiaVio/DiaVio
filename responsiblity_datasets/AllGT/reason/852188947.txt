The reason for this is that V2 was initially forced to swerve and depart the roadway due to a non-contact vehicle moving into its travel lane. However, the driver of V2 overcorrected and lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it crossing both northbound lanes, impacting the cable barrier, and ultimately entering the travel path of V1. The collision between V1 and V2 was a direct result of V2's loss of control and subsequent entry into V1's path.
