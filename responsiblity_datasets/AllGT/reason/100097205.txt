The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was the one who applied the brakes and swerved left into the path of V2 (2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue, 4-door sedan). This action caused the collision between the front right of V2 and the left side of V1. Therefore, the driver of V1 is responsible for initiating the sequence of events that led to the accident.
