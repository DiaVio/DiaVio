The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before attempting to turn into the driveway. V1's failure to adequately surveil the road and recognize the presence of V2 resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the crash.
