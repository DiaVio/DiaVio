The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to drift across the center line and right lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. This resulted in the vehicle's right front wheel(s) traveling off the right roadside. Although the driver became alert and attempted to steer left abruptly, the vehicle entered into an ever-increasing counterclockwise yaw, ultimately leading to the vehicle tripping to the right and overturning multiple times. The driver's fatigue may have contributed to the loss of control, but ultimately, it was the driver's actions that caused the vehicle to leave the roadway and roll over.
