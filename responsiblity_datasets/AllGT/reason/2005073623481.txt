The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve in the road. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle loss of control due to poor road conditions," indicating that the wet roadway and freezing temperature contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control. Additionally, the critical reason was coded as "decision error-too fast for curve/turn," suggesting that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too high for the curve, given the road conditions.
