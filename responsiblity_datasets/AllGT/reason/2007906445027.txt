The driver admitted to being unfamiliar with the roadway and feeling lost, which contributed to his confusion and split-second decision to change lanes. He failed to properly check his surroundings before making the lane change, resulting in a collision with V2, the 2006 Toyota Corolla. V1's failure to look or see before changing lanes, combined with his unfamiliarity with the road and discomfort with the surrounding traffic density, led to the critical pre-crash event of the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side. Additionally, V1's vehicle had insufficient tire tread and a significantly underinflated tire, which may have further compromised its handling and control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to his failure to exercise proper caution and awareness while changing lanes.
