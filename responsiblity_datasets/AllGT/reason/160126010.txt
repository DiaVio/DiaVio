The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which means they had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V1, the 1999 Kia Sephia sedan, was traveling straight in their lane and had the right of way. The front of V1 contacted the left side of V2, indicating that V2 failed to yield and turned into the path of V1.
