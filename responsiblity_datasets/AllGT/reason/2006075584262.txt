The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not see the debris in time to take any avoidance maneuver. This is evident from the driver's statement that she did not see the debris until it was too late. As a result, V1 impacted the debris, leading to the subsequent loss of control and collision with the guardrail and embankment.
