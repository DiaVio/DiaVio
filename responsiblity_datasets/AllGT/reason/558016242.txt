The reason for this is that the driver veered to the right in an attempt to avoid a collision with a deer, causing the right wheels of the vehicle to leave the pavement. As the driver tried to return to the roadway, she lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it rotating counterclockwise, crossing the centerline, and ultimately departing the roadway. The impact with the west ditch embankment caused the vehicle to roll multiple times before coming to a rest. While encountering a deer crossing the path can be unexpected and challenging to react to, the driver's decision to veer to the right and subsequently losing control of the vehicle suggests a lack of proper control and judgment, making the case vehicle primarily responsible for the accident.
