The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to his driving. He was looking for an address and may have been looking at directions or a map on the passenger seat, which caused him to drift into the parking lane and strike V2 (the 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser) in the rear. This indicates that V1's driver was not exercising proper care and control of his vehicle, leading to the collision.
