The driver admitted that she "wasn't paying attention to the car in front of her," indicating a lack of attention and negligence on her part. This inattention led to her striking the back of V2 (the 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee), which then caused V2 to move forward and collide with the back of V3 (the 2004 Mazda 6). Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and pay attention to the traffic ahead resulted in the chain reaction collision.
