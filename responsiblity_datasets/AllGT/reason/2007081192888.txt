The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the wheel assembly of the trailer detached from the vehicle, causing it to bounce over the center median and into the southbound lanes, ultimately striking V2. This detachment was due to the improper installation of the spindle nut keeper on the hub assembly of the wheel. The maintenance records indicate that the same trailer axle wheel assembly had detached three months prior to the crash, suggesting a recurring issue that was not properly addressed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the failure to properly maintain and secure the trailer's wheel assembly, resulting in its detachment and subsequent collision with V2.
