The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which means they had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V1, the 2005 Mercury Mariner, was traveling straight in the northbound lane and had the right of way. V2 failed to yield and turned in front of V1, resulting in the frontal impact and subsequent injuries to the driver of V1.
