The reason for this is that the driver of the Case Vehicle steered sharply to the left for an undetermined reason, causing the vehicle to leave the roadway and collide with the concrete center divider. The driver then lost control of the vehicle, causing it to veer across the southbound lanes and ultimately collide with the guardrail. The driver's actions and loss of control led to the accident and subsequent injuries to both occupants, with the front right seat passenger sustaining the more serious injuries.
