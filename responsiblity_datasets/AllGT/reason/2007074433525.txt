The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic, specifically V2, before making the left turn, resulting in the collision. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was encroached upon by V1. However, the critical reason for this event was "not coded to this vehicle," suggesting that V2's actions were not a significant contributing factor to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance while making a left turn at the intersection.
