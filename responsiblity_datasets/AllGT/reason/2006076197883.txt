The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of approximately 128 kmph (80 mph) while attempting to overtake and pass the non-contact vehicles. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle after returning to the southbound lane, which resulted in the vehicle rotating counter-clockwise and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 101 kmph, which exceeds the speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph). This indicates that the driver of V1 was driving at an excessive speed, which further contributed to the loss of control. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was found to have pending charges for possession of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia, DUI drugs, and endangerment. While these charges may not directly relate to the cause of the crash, they suggest that the driver may have been impaired or distracted, which could have affected their ability to maintain control of the vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, poor directional control, and potential impairment or distraction.
