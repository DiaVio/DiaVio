The reason for V1's responsibility is poor direction control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. This is supported by the fact that V1 departed the right side of the road into soft, loose soil and was unable to safely return to the roadway. Additionally, the vehicle made contact with a telephone pole and rotated before coming to a rest. The driver's inexperience and the road conditions (lack of shoulder or fog line) were contributing factors, but ultimately it was V1's failure to control the vehicle that led to the crash.
