The driver of V1, while waiting for the signal to turn green, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. This is evident from the fact that the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). Additionally, the driver's general discomfort with the intersection was coded as an associated factor. On the other hand, the driver of V2 had a green light and was traveling at the appropriate speed. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V1 turned left in front of V2. The driver of V2 claimed to have seen V1 before the crash but assumed that V1 would yield or at least slow down. This false assumption can be attributed to the driver's inexperience with this particular road. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and the driver's discomfort with the intersection. V2, on the other hand, had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision.
