The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) and the advisory speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) for the curve. Additionally, the driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling on the slushy surface, which was a result of the environmental factor of slick roads due to ice. The driver's decision to pass the parked truck on the left, while still in his lane, also contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the mountain. The external distraction of the stranded motorist may have further affected the driver's ability to maintain proper directional control.
