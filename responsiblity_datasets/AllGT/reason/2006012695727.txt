The driver of V1 admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the crash, with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .203, which is well above the legal limit. This indicates that the driver was impaired and not in a suitable condition to operate a vehicle safely. Additionally, the driver reported being in a hurry to get to his wife, which suggests a disregard for traffic laws and a potential lack of attention to the road. Furthermore, the critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for this event was coded as V1 being too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others. This indicates that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed, which compromised the driver's ability to react to the non-contact vehicle slowing down in front of him. Lastly, the driver of V1 mentioned being uncomfortable with the brakes on his vehicle, but the police inspection found no issues with the brakes. This suggests that the driver may have been looking for an excuse to explain his inability to stop in time. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired state, excessive speed, and potential lack of attention to the road.
