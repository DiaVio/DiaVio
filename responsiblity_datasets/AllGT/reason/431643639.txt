The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the double yellow line and impacted the left side of Vehicle 2 (V2) while entering the intersection. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way and caused the initial collision. Additionally, V1 continued into the southbound lane and collided with the front bumper of Vehicle 3 (V3), further indicating V1's failure to maintain control and avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the sequence of events described, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
