The reason for this is that V2 drifted into the northbound travel lane, causing the collision with Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2006 Chevrolet Equinox. V2's movement into the wrong lane resulted in the front-end impact with V1, leading to the activation of V1's seat belt retractor pretensioners and the deployment of both frontal airbags. Additionally, V1 underrode and was overpowered by V2, indicating that V2's movement into the wrong lane was a significant contributing factor to the severity of the accident.
