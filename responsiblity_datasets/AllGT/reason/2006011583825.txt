The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit, and engaging in aggressive driving behavior by passing another vehicle. Additionally, the driver was aware of the "dip" in the road and still chose to maintain a high speed. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with the depression in the roadway and the darkness, led to V1 becoming airborne and ultimately veering off the roadway, causing the collision with multiple trees. The driver's actions and decisions directly contributed to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
