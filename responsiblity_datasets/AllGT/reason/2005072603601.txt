The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that he applied the brakes, the parking brake, and put the vehicle transmission in "park," but the vehicle would not stop. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to properly maintain and operate the vehicle, as well as a lack of awareness of any potential brake issues prior to the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 steered left to avoid the pedestrians, which resulted in the vehicle striking a large planter in the median. This suggests a failure to properly control the vehicle and make appropriate decisions in response to the situation. Overall, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain and operate the vehicle properly, as well as their lack of awareness and appropriate response to the brake issue and the presence of pedestrians in the crosswalk.
