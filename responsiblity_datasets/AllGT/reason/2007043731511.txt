The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was fleeing the police after a failed burglary attempt. The driver was traveling at a high speed of 113 kmph (70 mph) in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, which is considered too fast for the curve on the road. This excessive speed caused V1 to depart from the left side of the road and crash into three small trees, resulting in the driver being ejected from the vehicle and sustaining serious injuries.
