The driver of V1 stated that she was attempting to merge into the left lane from the right lane, but the left lane was already occupied. She overcorrected and lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it exiting the roadway and colliding with the concrete median and a bridge support. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was a performance error: overcompensation. The driver's attempt to merge into the left lane and her subsequent overcorrection led to the loss of control. Additionally, contributory factors such as inadequate surveillance (failed to look to the left side), the presence of medications, and wearing prescription glasses were identified. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the contributing factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
