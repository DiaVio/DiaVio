The reason for this is that V2 drifted across the center-line and entered the path of V1, the 2011 Ford Edge station wagon. V1, the driver of the station wagon, attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, indicating that they were driving within their lane and taking appropriate action to avoid the accident. However, V2's drifting across the center-line caused the collision in a full frontal mode.
