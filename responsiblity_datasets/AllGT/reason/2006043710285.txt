The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. - The driver of V1 failed to see V2 in motion sooner, indicating inadequate surveillance. - The driver of V1 reported being distracted by her three occupants, which contributed to the inadequate surveillance. - V1's driver claimed that the traffic light blends in with the trees and sky, suggesting a lack of attention to the road and surroundings. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light, inadequate surveillance, and distractions.
