The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a left turn in front of oncoming traffic without adequately surveilling the intersection. The witness behind V2 stated that V2 did not stop or slow down and was traveling at a relatively low speed of 16 kmph (10 mph). This indicates that V2 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and did not yield the right of way to V1.
