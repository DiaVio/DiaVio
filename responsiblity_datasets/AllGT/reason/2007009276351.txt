The driver of V2 stated that she entered the intersection making a left turn and claimed that V1 ran the red light. However, the driver of V1 stated that she had the green light as she approached the intersection. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as this vehicle traveling and turning left at the intersection, with the critical reason being inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe the intersection and failed to stop for the traffic control device. Furthermore, it was observed that several people disobeyed the traffic control device in all directions, indicating a potential issue with compliance at this intersection. However, this does not absolve V2 of responsibility for failing to properly observe the intersection and stop for the red light. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to stop for the traffic control device.
