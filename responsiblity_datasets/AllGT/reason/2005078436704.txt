The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming prior to running off the roadway. This driver-related factor of inattention directly contributed to the vehicle departing the right side of the roadway and subsequently colliding with various objects, including a milepost sign, a barbed wire fence, and two dirt mounds. The driver's lack of focus and failure to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the accident.
