The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to exit from the entrance of the parking lot and execute a left turn to travel southbound. However, V2, the 1993 two-door Ford F250 4x4 pickup truck, was already traveling northbound on the two-lane road. V2 tried to avoid the crash by steering to the left, but was unable to do so and ended up impacting the left side of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash as it failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
