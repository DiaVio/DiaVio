The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the curve on the exit ramp. The posted advisory speed limit for the ramp was 56 kmph (35 mph), but V1 was reported to be traveling at 72 kmph (45 mph) according to the police report. This excessive speed caused V1 to lose control and veer off the left side of the roadway, resulting in the collision with a tree and subsequent rollover. Additionally, the driver's claim of rain at the time of the crash was not supported by the investigating officer or the researcher, who noted only condensation on the grass roadside. This suggests that the driver's perception of the weather conditions may have been inaccurate, further indicating a lack of attentiveness and decision-making error on the part of V1's driver. Furthermore, the driver's use of medication with potential side effects such as drowsiness, tiredness, tremors, dizziness, and light-headedness raises concerns about their ability to safely operate a vehicle. While the specific condition for which the medication was taken is unknown, the potential impact on the driver's alertness and coordination could have contributed to the decision error of driving too fast for the curve. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, lack of attentiveness to the roadway conditions, and potential impairment from medication side effects.
