The driver of V1 continued through the intersection even though the traffic signal was changing from green to yellow. Additionally, the passenger in V1 warned the driver that V3 (the 2007 Cadillac Escalade SUV) was turning in front of them. Despite these warnings, V1 failed to take any avoidance actions. Therefore, V1's failure to stop or take appropriate action to avoid the collision, despite being aware of the turning vehicle, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
