The reason for this is that V2 made an illegal maneuver by running a red light, which resulted in the collision with V1. The critical precrash event for V2 was when it began crossing over the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was a decision error. Additionally, the lack of an interview with the driver of V2 prevents any associated factors from being coded to her. However, it is clear that V2's decision to run the red light was the main cause of the accident.
