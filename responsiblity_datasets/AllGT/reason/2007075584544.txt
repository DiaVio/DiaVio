The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by observing deer off the left side of the road, causing him to veer off the right side of the road and ultimately collide with a sign post. Despite being familiar with the route and traveling at the speed limit, the driver's external distraction led to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road.
