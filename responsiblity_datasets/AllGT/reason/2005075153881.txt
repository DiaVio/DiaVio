The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and failed to see the traffic control, resulting in the collision with V2 (the Ford Crown Victoria). Additionally, V1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver and was inattentive, although the reason for the inattention is unknown.
