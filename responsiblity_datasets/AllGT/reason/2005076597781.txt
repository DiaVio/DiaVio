The driver of V1 was operating the vehicle at a very high rate of speed, which was reported by the driver herself. Additionally, she admitted to not having driven this vehicle or any other pickup truck before, indicating a lack of experience. Furthermore, she was under the influence of drugs (methadone and marijuana) and alcohol at the time of the crash, despite medical records indicating a BAC of 0.00. These factors, including speeding, lack of experience, and impaired driving, contribute to the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
