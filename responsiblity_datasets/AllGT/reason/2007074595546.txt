The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking left for the street sign, which caused her to not notice that V2 (2000 Lexus ES300) was stopped in front of her. This distraction led to V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and subsequently resulted in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 had the opportunity to observe V2 and avoid the crash if the driver had been paying proper attention. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
