The reason for V1's responsibility is that it traveled off the roadway to the right side, striking a utility pole and a tree. The driver's decision to leave the hospital without completing the necessary checks and blood test also indicates a lack of responsibility. Additionally, the fact that the critical reason for the vehicle traveling off the road is unknown suggests that the driver may have been at fault for not maintaining control of the vehicle.
