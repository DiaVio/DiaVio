The reason for this is that V1 crossed into the northbound lane and struck V2 in the left side with its front. The driver of V1 stated that there was gravel on the roadway, which caused him to slide into the oncoming lane. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the motorcycle while negotiating the curve, leading to the collision with V2. While V2 (the 2007 Ford Crown Victoria) was on a call to a domestic dispute and had his lights and siren on, the driver attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right. However, V2 was unable to avoid the motorcycle that had crossed into its lane. Therefore, based on the actions and statements of the drivers involved, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to losing control and crossing into the oncoming lane.
