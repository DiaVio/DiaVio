The critical pre-crash event for V1 was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was inadequate surveillance (failed to look but did not see). This suggests that V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic before making the left turn, leading to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the Ford F150) was also cited for aggressive driving/speeding and traveling too fast for conditions. While these factors may have contributed to the severity of the collision, V2's actions alone do not absolve V1 of responsibility for failing to yield the right of way and not properly observing the traffic before making the left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to inadequate surveillance while making the left turn.
