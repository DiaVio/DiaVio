The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it attempted to make a left turn from the northbound roadway onto the westbound roadway, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse coupe, which was traveling eastbound. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
