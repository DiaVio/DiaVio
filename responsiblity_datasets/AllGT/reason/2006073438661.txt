The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is considered a driver-related factor. The driver's fatigue, resulting from working a midnight shift and getting only four and a half hours of sleep per day, likely contributed to him falling asleep while driving. This caused V1 to veer off the road, collide with two utility poles, and crash into a fence. The fact that the driver was unable to see out of the vehicle to avoid the second pole and fence further supports the conclusion that the driver was not in control of the vehicle due to being asleep.
