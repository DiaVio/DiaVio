The reason for this is that V1 attempted to cross the southbound travel lane to execute a left turn, which means it was making a maneuver across oncoming traffic. V2 (the 1998 Toyota Avalon) was traveling in the southbound passing lane and had the right of way. V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and properly assess the situation resulted in the collision.
