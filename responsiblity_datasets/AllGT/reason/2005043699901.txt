The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 stated that he had difficulty seeing to his right due to an abundance of signs on the roadside and a hillcrest further down the road to the south. Despite waiting for approximately 10 seconds, V1 proceeded to cross the intersection without properly ensuring that it was safe to do so. This lack of proper surveillance led to the collision with V2.
