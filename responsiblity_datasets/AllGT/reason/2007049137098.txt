The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway on the west side and struck a tree, indicating poor directional control. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," further supporting the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of poor directional control.
