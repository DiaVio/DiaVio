The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted right and onto the westbound shoulder area, initiating a right steering maneuver but over-steering, which caused it to cross back and over the westbound travel lane and into the eastbound lane/shoulder area. This action ultimately led to the collision with Vehicle 1.
