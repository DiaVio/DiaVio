The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly observe the intersection and failed to notice V2 approaching from the westbound direction. V2, on the other hand, had the right of way as they were traveling in a through lane on the east/west roadway. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the crash and was simply crossing the intersection when V1 failed to yield. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to V2, who had the right of way.
