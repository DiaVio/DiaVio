The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before initiating her left turn. She stated that she did not see V2, which indicates a driver-related error of inadequate surveillance. This failure to observe the oncoming vehicle in the opposite direction led to the collision. While V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Malibu) did have an associated factor of traveling too fast, it is important to note that V1's failure to yield the right-of-way was the critical pre-crash event. V2's false assumption that V1 would yield the right-of-way can be seen as a contributing factor, but ultimately, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic is the primary cause of the accident.
