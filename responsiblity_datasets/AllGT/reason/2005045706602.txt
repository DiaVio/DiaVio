The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 departed the right side of the road at the beginning of the curve left, indicating a potential driver error. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was unrestrained, which could have contributed to the severity of the crash. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was coded as an unknown driver error. The driver's attempt to regain control by overcompensating and steering too far left also suggests a performance error on the part of the driver.
