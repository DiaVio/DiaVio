The reason for this is that V1 ran a red light and entered the intersection without stopping. The driver of V1 admitted to daydreaming and not seeing the traffic light or the cars stopped at the intersection. This inattention and failure to obey traffic signals led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at a red light and their inattentiveness make them primarily responsible for the accident.
