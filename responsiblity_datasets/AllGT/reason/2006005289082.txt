The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, crossing the path of V2 (the silver 1998 Lincoln Continental) which was traveling straight on the southbound roadway. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's failure to yield also led to a secondary collision with V3 (the maroon 2000 Hyundai Elantra), which was traveling northbound on the roadway. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
