The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic (specifically V2) before making a left turn. The driver's attention was focused on V3, which was stopped at the stop sign, and did not look in the direction of V2's oncoming approach. This failure to adequately surveil the intersection and properly assess the oncoming traffic led to the collision with V2.
