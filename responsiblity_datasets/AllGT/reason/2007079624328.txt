The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 disregarded the red light at the intersection, as observed by a witness. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic signal, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving in an aggressive manner, accelerating into the intersection and tailgating other vehicles. These actions further contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
