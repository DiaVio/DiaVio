The driver of V1 was traveling at 70 mph, which is the posted speed limit, but the critical pre-crash event was coded as "control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." This indicates that the driver was going too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of other road users. Additionally, the driver stated that a non-contact vehicle suddenly cut into his lane, causing him to brake and swerve to avoid a collision. However, the driver's response of overcompensating and swerving back and forth ultimately led to the loss of control of the vehicle. Contributing factors such as congestion due to another crash ahead and the driver's statement of being in a hurry also suggest that the driver's decision-making was compromised. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience, having only been driving for just over a year, and the possible side effects of prescribed medication taken for attention deficit disorder could have also played a role in the driver's inability to respond effectively to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error of traveling too fast for conditions and the subsequent loss of control.
