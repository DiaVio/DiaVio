The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve on the ramp, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver overcorrected when trying to avoid departing the roadway, which further contributed to the crash. The driver's lack of familiarity with the ramp and the fact that he had been on the road for two hours may have also played a role in the driver's inability to navigate the curve safely.
