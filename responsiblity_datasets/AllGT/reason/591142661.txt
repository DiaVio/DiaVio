The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was the vehicle involved in the crash and it left the roadway, resulting in a frontal impact with a tree. The driver of V1 steered right in an attempt to keep the vehicle on the roadway, but it still traveled left of the centerline and ultimately collided with the tree.
