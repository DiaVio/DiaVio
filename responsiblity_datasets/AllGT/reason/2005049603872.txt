The driver of V1 suffered a diabetic-related seizure and blacked out, which impaired their ability to control the vehicle. As a result, V1 veered into the third lane and collided with V2 (the 2002 Chevrolet 2500 Pick up). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 crossed into the adjacent lane. This, combined with the driver's physical impairment, establishes V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
