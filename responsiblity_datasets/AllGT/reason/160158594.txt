The reason for this is that V1 lost control on the wet pavement and departed the rightmost southbound travel lane, crossing in front of V2 (the 2001 Freightliner Classic tractor trailer). V2 attempted to avoid contact by changing lanes, but V1 continued across the center lane and entered the leftmost lane in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's loss of control and failure to maintain its lane of travel led to the collision, making it primarily responsible.
