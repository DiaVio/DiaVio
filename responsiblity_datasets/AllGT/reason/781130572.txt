The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to realize that V2, the 2001 Volkswagen Passat, was gradually slowing down in front of them. Despite attempting to brake, V1 still struck the back of V2 with its front, indicating a failure to maintain a safe following distance and exercise proper caution while driving.
