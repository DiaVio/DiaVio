The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver stated that the vehicle had bald tires and bad brakes, which could have contributed to the loss of control. The driver also mentioned feeling fatigued and taking medication for Attention Deficit Disorder, which may have affected their ability to safely navigate the curve. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed, poor vehicle maintenance, potential fatigue, and medication use.
