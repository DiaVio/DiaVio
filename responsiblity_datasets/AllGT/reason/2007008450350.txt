The driver of V1 is primarily responsible because he failed to take immediate evasive action when he noticed the deer in the field. Instead of braking immediately, he continued to watch the deer and only steered right when the deer entered the roadway. This incorrect evasive action caused V1 to strike the telephone pole and embankment. If the driver had braked immediately upon seeing the deer, he could have potentially avoided the collision altogether.
