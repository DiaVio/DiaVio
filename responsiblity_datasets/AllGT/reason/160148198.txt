The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection from the southbound roadway to the eastbound roadway. During this turn, V1's left side contacted the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2001 Lincoln Navigator, resulting in the collision. As the turning vehicle, V1 had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic and ensure a safe turn. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and make a safe left turn makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
