The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control and slid off the roadway due to the icy conditions. The clockwise rotation and lateral slide indicate a lack of control over the vehicle, which ultimately led to it rolling over multiple times and coming to rest in a damaged state. The driver's inability to maintain control in the icy conditions suggests negligence or failure to adapt to the weather conditions.
