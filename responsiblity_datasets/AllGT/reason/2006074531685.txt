The driver of V1 admitted to changing lanes without noticing V2 (the 1993 Honda Accord) stopped in lane one. This indicates a failure to maintain proper awareness of the road and surrounding traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he accelerated to avoid a potential collision with a pickup truck, which further suggests a lack of attention and poor decision-making. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to notice and avoid the stopped vehicle in front of them.
