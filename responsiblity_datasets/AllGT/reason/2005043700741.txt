The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a 77-year-old female, admitted to drifting off the right side of the road and then making an abrupt steering maneuver, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle. This poor directional control led to V1 crossing the center line, rotating, and ultimately impacting a patch of small trees. The driver's age may have been an associate factor contributing to the performance error.
