The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V1 admitted to creeping forward and looking to the right (west) for a cross street, indicating a lack of attention to the immediate surroundings. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 entering the intersection without ensuring it was clear, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle Two (V2) stated that she saw V1 stopped at the intersection and proceeded accordingly. Therefore, V2's actions were not the primary cause of the accident. In summary, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and ensure it was clear before proceeding makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
