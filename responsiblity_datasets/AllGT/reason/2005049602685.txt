The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted speed limit (72 kmph or 45 mph in a 56 kmph or 35 mph zone) and was unable to respond to the unexpected action of V1 (the Saturn Sl) stopping to make a left turn. V2's excessive speed prevented them from being able to stop or avoid the collision in time. Additionally, V2's claim of being in a hurry due to work-related delivery schedule suggests a lack of attention and potentially reckless driving behavior. On the other hand, V1, although stopped in the wrong travel lane to make a left turn, was not the primary cause of the accident. The driver of V1 was inexperienced and did not have a driver's license, which may have contributed to their decision to stop in the travel lane. However, V2's excessive speed and inability to respond to the situation were the critical factors that led to the collision.
