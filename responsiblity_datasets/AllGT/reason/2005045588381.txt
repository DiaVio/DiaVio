The reason for this is that the driver, a 14-year-old female, was driving without a license and was joyriding without her parent's permission. She was also inexperienced, having only driven a car a couple of times under her father's supervision. The critical pre-crash event was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating a performance error and poor directional control. The driver failed to take adequate evasive actions and made insufficient steering and braking inputs, leading to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
