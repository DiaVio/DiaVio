The reason for this is that V1 was traveling off the right side lane line onto the shoulder, indicating a deviation from the designated lane. The driver of V1 then overcorrected, causing the vehicle to move across three lanes of travel before impacting a concrete barrier. This suggests a lack of control and proper handling of the vehicle by the driver of V1, leading to the accident.
