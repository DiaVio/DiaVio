The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to observe the Yield Sign and misjudged the speed of V2. V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection without stopping or using a turn signal, causing V2 to collide with V1 on the left side. Additionally, V1 made no avoidance maneuver to prevent the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to yield, misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2, and disregard for traffic rules and signals make them primarily responsible for the accident.
