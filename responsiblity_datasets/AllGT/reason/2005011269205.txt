The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep at the wheel, leading to the vehicle drifting left, crossing multiple lanes, and ultimately crashing into a utility pole. The driver's fatigue and lack of control over the vehicle contributed to the accident, as evidenced by the absence of any evasive actions and the gradual run-off-road without attempts to avoid the crash.
