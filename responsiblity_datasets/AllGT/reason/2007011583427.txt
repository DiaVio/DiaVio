The driver of V1 had a medical condition that could cause loss of consciousness, and she was taking medication for it. The medical report states that there was a questionable loss of consciousness, and she tested positive for opiates. This suggests that the driver of V1 may have experienced a medical episode or impairment at the time of the crash, which would explain the lack of any avoidance actions. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Gillig city bus) was legally stopped at a marked bus stop with its flashers activated. The driver was following proper procedures and had just picked up a passenger when the collision occurred. There is no indication that the driver of V2 was at fault or contributed to the accident in any way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's medical condition and potential impairment.
