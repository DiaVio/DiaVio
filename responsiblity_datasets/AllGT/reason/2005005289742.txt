The reason for this is that V1 drifted over the left lane line and made contact with the front of V2 (the 2003 Honda Accord). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain their lane and collided with V2, which was stopped in the designated left-turn lane. V2 was following the traffic signals and was not at fault for the collision. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded for V1 was "traveling over the lane line left side of travel lane," indicating that V1 was not in proper control of their vehicle. The Critical Reason for this event was coded as an unknown decision error, further suggesting that V1's actions were responsible for the crash. It is important to note that the driver of V1 refused an interview and did not participate in the study, which may have provided further insights into their actions and decision-making leading up to the crash. However, based on the available information, V1's failure to maintain their lane and make contact with V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
