The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they overcompensated after an unidentified vehicle changed lanes in front of them. This overcompensation led to V1 losing control of their vehicle and ultimately colliding with the concrete traffic barrier on the right shoulder. The police report also indicates that V1 exhibited poor directional control and chose an inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive maneuver. Therefore, V1's actions and lack of control over their vehicle make them primarily responsible for the collision.
