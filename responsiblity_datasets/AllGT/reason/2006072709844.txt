The reason for this is that Vehicle Two was encroaching into the path of Vehicle One, which was already traveling through the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle Two failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle One, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there is no information suggesting any driver error on the part of Vehicle One. Therefore, Vehicle Two is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and encroachment into the path of Vehicle One.
