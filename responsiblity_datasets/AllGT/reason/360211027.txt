The reason for this is that V1 drove off the roadway to the left, across the paved shoulder, and into the grassy median. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the designated lane, leading to the subsequent collision with the light pole. The driver's reaction to brake just before impact suggests a lack of control and awareness, further supporting V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
