The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were traveling too fast for the conditions, which included heavy rain, wet roadway, and poor visibility. V1 failed to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2 (the 1994 Chevy C1500 Pickup) that had stopped for forward traffic ahead. This indicates that V1 was unable to respond to the unexpected action of V2 stopping due to their excessive speed.
