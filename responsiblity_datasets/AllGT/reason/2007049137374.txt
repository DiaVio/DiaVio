The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake pedal, causing the vehicle to unexpectedly accelerate and collide with the back of V2 (the 1990 GMC Sierra). This indicates a driver-related factor of poor directional control. While V2 was decelerating to stop for the red traffic light, V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and react appropriately, resulting in the collision. The driver of V1 had been following V2 for some distance and should have been aware of the presence of the vehicle in front. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper control of the vehicle and maintain a safe distance makes them primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
