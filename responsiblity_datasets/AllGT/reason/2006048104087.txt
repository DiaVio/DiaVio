The driver of V1 made a false assumption of the actions of the other vehicle (V2) by thinking it was a three-way stop instead of a four-way stop. This false assumption led to V1 entering the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield the right of way to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
