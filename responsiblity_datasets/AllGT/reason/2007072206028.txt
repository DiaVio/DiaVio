The driver of V1 attempted to change lanes abruptly without properly checking for other vehicles in the adjacent lane. This sudden lane change caused the driver to overcompensate by steering left when he realized there was a non-contact vehicle in lane one. This overcompensation led to V1 rotating counterclockwise and ultimately colliding with the jersey barrier in the median. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to speeding at the time of the crash, which is another contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly change lanes and overcompensation, as well as the involvement of speeding.
