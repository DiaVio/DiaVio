Reason: V1 lost control and started to rotate in a clockwise direction while attempting to negotiate a left-hand curve. V1 continued to skid off the right side of the roadway and ultimately struck the brick fence with the left side. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
