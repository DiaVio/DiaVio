The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the left, traversed multiple lanes of oncoming traffic, and ultimately left the road, resulting in the collision with various objects. The driver of V1 reported having no memory of the crash events and being under stress and fatigued from lack of sleep. Additionally, the driver suffers from bipolar personality disorder and takes multiple medications. The vehicle itself also had reported issues such as squeaky brakes, loose steering, and starter problems. These factors, combined with the obscured windshield, suggest that the driver's actions and the condition of the vehicle contributed to the collision.
