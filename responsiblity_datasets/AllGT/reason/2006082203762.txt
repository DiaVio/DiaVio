The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by something inside his vehicle and looked up too late to avoid the collision. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying attention to the road and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2). As a result, V1 rear-ended V2, causing a chain reaction with V2 subsequently rear-ending V3.
