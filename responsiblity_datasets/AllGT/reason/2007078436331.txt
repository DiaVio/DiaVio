The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it traveled off the left side of the road, indicating a driver error or lack of control. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation in steering right caused V1 to rotate and ultimately veer off the right side of the road, resulting in the collision with the concrete embankment and subsequent rollover. The associated factors of V1's speed and the driver's use of cannabinoids further contribute to the driver's impairment and potential lack of judgment, which likely played a role in the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Overall, V1's actions and the driver-related factors indicate that the driver's errors and impairment were the primary causes of the crash.
