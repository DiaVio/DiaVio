The driver of Vehicle #1 made a decision error by falsely assuming the actions of Vehicle #2. Despite seeing Vehicle #2 approaching with its right turn signal activated, the driver of Vehicle #1 incorrectly assumed that Vehicle #2 was turning onto the road that Vehicle #1 was coming from. This false assumption led the driver of Vehicle #1 to proceed to pull out and attempt to make a right turn, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was inexperienced, having been driving for less than a year. Inexperience can contribute to poor judgment and decision-making on the road. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error and inexperience.
