The reason for this is that the driver of V1 proceeded into the intersection without using the seat belt restraint, despite the vehicle being equipped with lap and shoulder belts. This failure to use the seat belt restraint contributed to the serious injury sustained by the driver. Additionally, V1 was struck on the left front, forward of the passenger compartment by the front plane of Vehicle 2 (V2), indicating that V1 may have failed to yield the right of way to V2.
