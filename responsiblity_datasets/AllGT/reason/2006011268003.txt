The driver of V1 made the decision to pass the van without being aware that there were other vehicles directly in front of the van. This lack of awareness and failure to anticipate the possibility of the van also attempting to pass resulted in V1 swerving onto the gravel shoulder to avoid a collision. This sudden maneuver caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, leading to the subsequent collision with the embankment and tree. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their unsafe passing maneuver and failure to properly assess the traffic situation.
