The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to pass two slow-moving medium/heavy vehicles by crossing the single broken yellow line into the southbound lane of travel. This action of crossing into the opposite lane resulted in V1 traveling off the road edge and impacting a tree, leading to the off-set frontal crash configuration.
