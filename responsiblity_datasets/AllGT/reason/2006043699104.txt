The reason for Vehicle 1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that he could not see the oncoming vehicle due to the roadway curvature. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed before entering an intersection, especially when there are stop signs controlling the other approaches. Vehicle 1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2.
