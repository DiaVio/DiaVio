V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and collided with V2, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way. This is evident from the physical evidence at the scene, which suggests that V1 attempted to brake prior to the collision. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V1 was coded as an unknown driver error, specifically an illegal maneuver of failing to stop for a traffic control device.
