The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was stopped at a stop sign, preparing to make a left turn. V2, the 2008 Toyota Prius four door hatchback, was traveling northbound through the intersection when V1 began to make the left turn. As V1 was making the left turn, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2.
