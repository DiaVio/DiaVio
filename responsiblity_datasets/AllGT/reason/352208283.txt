The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, while Vehicle 2 (the 2010 Mercedes-Benz C300 4-door sedan) was traveling straight through the intersection. Vehicle 1 turned left in front of Vehicle 2, causing the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 to collide with the frontal plane of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
