The reason for this is that V1, a 2000 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor model, was traveling westbound in lane two and for unknown reasons, changed to the number one lane to the right, went up onto the curb, and struck a light pole with its front. The presence of straight pre-crash braking skid marks indicates that the driver attempted to brake before the impact, suggesting that the driver had control of the vehicle at the time. Additionally, the driver's license had a suspended status, indicating a potential violation of traffic laws. Furthermore, the driver fled the scene after the crash, which raises concerns about their responsibility and accountability. Although the driver turned himself into the police several hours later, their initial decision to flee suggests a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic regulations. Therefore, based on the driver's actions, including the lane change, departure from the roadway, and subsequent impact with the light pole, Vehicle One (V1) is primarily responsible for the crash.
