The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the opposite lane of traffic, and according to the driver's statement, he did not adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before initiating the turn. The critical reason coded for V1 is "inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see." This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the situation and failed to notice the approaching vehicle (V2) until it was too late to avoid the collision. While V2 (the driver of the Hyundai Elantra) did not have her lights on at the time of the crash, this alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2's failure to have her lights on may have contributed to the visibility issue, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
