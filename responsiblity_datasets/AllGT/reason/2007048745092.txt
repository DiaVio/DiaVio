The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down at the gear shifter, which caused him to travel off the right side of the roadway. This distraction led to a loss of control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, being only sixteen years old and having been driving for only one year, contributed to the poor directional control and inability to recover from the initial mistake. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors, specifically internal distraction and inexperience.
