The reason for this is that V2 initiated a left turn at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. The critical reason for this event is listed as "Unknown Driver Error - Type of driver error unknown." This suggests that V2 may have made an error while making the left turn, such as misjudging the distance or speed of oncoming traffic. Additionally, V2 collided with V1 in the westbound lane, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. This further supports the conclusion that V2 is primarily responsible for the crash.
