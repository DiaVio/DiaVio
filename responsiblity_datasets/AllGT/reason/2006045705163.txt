The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they misjudged the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle (V1) while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. This misjudgment led to V2 turning left in front of V1, causing the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the windshield of V2 was dirty enough to obscure the driver's view, which could have further contributed to the misjudgment of the gap or speed of V1. Therefore, V2's misjudgment and failure to yield the right of way to V1 resulted in the accident, making them primarily responsible.
