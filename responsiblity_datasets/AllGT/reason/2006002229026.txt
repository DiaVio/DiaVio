The driver of Vehicle #1 went off the roadway to the left, struck a reflector pole, and then overcompensated, crossing three lanes and going off the road to the right. This indicates a recognition error and internal distraction on the part of the driver. The passenger's statement about handing the driver a bottle of water while she was eating a piece of dry cake suggests that the driver was distracted and not fully focused on the road. Additionally, the fact that the driver refused an interview and the witness did not return messages indicates a lack of cooperation, which further suggests responsibility on the part of Vehicle #1. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's recognition error and internal distraction.
