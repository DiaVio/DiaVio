The reason for this is that V1 broke traction on the wet pavement, departed the right pavement edge, and subsequently collided with a small diameter tree. The driver of V1 initiated a lateral trajectory in response to the impact force, indicating a loss of control. The damage to V1 and the injuries sustained by the driver suggest that V1 was the vehicle that caused the accident.
