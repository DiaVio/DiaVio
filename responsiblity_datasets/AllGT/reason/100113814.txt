The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 ran off the right roadside and onto the dirt shoulder while negotiating a left curve. The driver then steered the vehicle in an extreme manner, causing it to enter into a counterclockwise yaw and roll over as it exited the opposite side of the roadway. The vehicle ultimately collided with a dirt embankment, a barbed wire fence, and a wooden utility pole. The driver's actions of veering off the roadway and overcorrecting led to the loss of control and subsequent rollover, resulting in the fatal injuries to the driver and severe injuries to the front right seat passenger.
