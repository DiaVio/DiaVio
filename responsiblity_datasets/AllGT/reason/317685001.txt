The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve on a wet road. The loss of traction and subsequent departure from the roadway, as well as the multiple tree contacts, indicate that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that V1 was the only vehicle involved in the crash suggests that the driver's actions or lack of control were the main contributing factors to the accident.
