The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 80 kmph (exceeding the posted speed limit of 40 kmph) and drove off the right side of the roadway, ultimately colliding with trees. The Critical Reason coded for this crash was an unknown decision error, suggesting that the driver made a mistake or error in judgment that led to the vehicle leaving the road. Additionally, the presence of alcohol was mentioned as an associated factor, although it is unclear if it directly contributed to the crash since the driver could not be interviewed. However, if it is determined that the driver was under the influence of alcohol, it would further support V1's responsibility for the crash. Overall, V1's excessive speed, unknown decision error, and potential involvement of alcohol indicate that they are primarily responsible for the crash.
