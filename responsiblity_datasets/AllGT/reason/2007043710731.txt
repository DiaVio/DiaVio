The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an exterior distraction, which was looking at her side view mirror to check if it was clear to change lanes. This distraction caused her to fail to look ahead and recognize the danger in front of her, resulting in her colliding with the back of V2 (the 2007 Chevrolet G1500). Additionally, the driver of V1 reported being upset and having trouble recalling events, indicating a lack of focus and attentiveness while driving. Rush hour congestion was also a contributing factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver error and distraction.
