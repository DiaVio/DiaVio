The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 changed lanes from lane three to lane two, and as a result, the front of V2 (the Toyota Scion Xb) made contact with the back of V1. This indicates that V1 initiated the lane change, which led to the collision. Although V1's driver stated that he did not cut off the driver of V2, the statement from the driver of V2 contradicts this. The driver of V2 mentioned that the other driver (V1) suddenly and unexpectedly cut over into her travel lane, leaving her with insufficient room to avoid a collision. This suggests that V1's lane change was sudden and not properly executed, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "other motor vehicle in lane traveling in the same direction with higher speed," indicating that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than V1. This further supports the notion that V1's lane change was not conducted safely, as it failed to account for the higher speed of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their unsafe lane change, which resulted in the collision with V2.
