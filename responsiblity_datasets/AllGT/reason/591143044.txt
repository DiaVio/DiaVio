The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection while V2, the 1997 Chevrolet Astro Van, was traveling straight through. V1 entered the intersection simultaneously with V2, causing the front of V2 to strike the right side of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's improper use of seat belts by the 49-year-old female driver may have contributed to the severity of her injuries. Wearing the shoulder portion of the belt under her left arm and across her chest is not the correct way to wear a seat belt, and this improper belting may have increased the risk of injury during the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to yield the right of way and the driver's improper use of seat belts.
