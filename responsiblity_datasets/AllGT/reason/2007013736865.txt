The reason for this is that V1 proceeded through the intersection on a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic laws. The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which likely contributed to their failure to stop at the red light. Falling asleep at the wheel is a driver-related factor and can impair judgment and reaction time. V2 (the driver of the 2001 GMC Sierra) had the green light and was proceeding through the intersection lawfully. V2's involvement in the crash was a result of V1's failure to stop at the red light. V3 (the driver of the 2000 Chevrolet Silverado) was not involved in the first harmful event and was waiting to turn left when the crash occurred. Therefore, V3 is not considered primarily responsible for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their illegal maneuver of running a red light and falling asleep while driving.
