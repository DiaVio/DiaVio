The driver of V1 attempted to avoid a collision with a non-contact vehicle by steering to the right, but in doing so, entered lane 1 and struck the left side of V2 (the 1963 Austin Healey 3000 Mk II convertible). This indicates that V1 made an incorrect evasive action, which was the critical reason for the collision. Additionally, V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance as they looked but didn't see the encroaching V2.
