The reason for this is that the driver was traveling at a high speed of approximately 97 kmph (60 mph) when the right rear tread separated from the tire. This tire failure caused the vehicle to lose control and veer into the emergency lane, strike a guardrail and a wooden post, and ultimately roll over off the roadway. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the condition of the tires contributed to the crash.
