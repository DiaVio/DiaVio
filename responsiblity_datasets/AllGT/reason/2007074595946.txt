The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver's inadequate surveillance, possibly due to distraction from conversing with her passengers, led to her not seeing V2 (the motorcycle) approaching from the opposite direction. This resulted in V1 entering the intersection and being struck by the front of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
