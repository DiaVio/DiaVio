The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve, indicating that they were traveling too fast for the conditions. This is supported by the fact that the roadway was wet due to rain, which would have reduced traction, and the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle despite being well-rested and not under the influence of any medications. Additionally, the severely uneven tire wear on both front tires suggests that the vehicle may not have been properly maintained, which could have contributed to the loss of control.
