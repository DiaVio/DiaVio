The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by the presence of a call girl passenger, which was confirmed by the driver of V2 and the proximity of the crash scene to a seedy city park. This distraction likely caused the driver of V1 to not properly assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's refusal to cooperate with the investigation, including refusing to be interviewed and have the vehicle inspected, further suggests a lack of responsibility on their part. On the other hand, V2's driver was unable to be interviewed and contacted, making it difficult to determine any contributing factors or responsibility on their part. The evidence at the scene suggests that V2 attempted to brake with lockup, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. Overall, based on the available information, V1's distracted driving and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
