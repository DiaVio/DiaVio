The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the snowy and icy road conditions. The driver reported that he was traveling between 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph), which was too fast given the weather conditions. This resulted in the vehicle fishtailing and ultimately departing the roadway. The driver's failure to adjust his speed to the conditions and inability to maintain control of the vehicle led to the crash.
