The driver of V1 stated that he was going through the green light when he was struck by V2. This indicates that V1 likely ran a red light, causing the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was "traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," suggesting that V1 was not following the traffic signals properly. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light and failing to yield the right of way to V2.
