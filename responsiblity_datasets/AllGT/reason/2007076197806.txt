The driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive speed of 96 kmph (60 mph) in a 24 kmph (15 mph) zone, which is more than four times the posted speed limit. Additionally, the driver admitted to trying to impress the passengers with his driving skills, indicating a reckless and irresponsible behavior. The driver's decision to skip work and the passengers ditching school also demonstrate a lack of responsibility and disregard for the law. Furthermore, the smooth tread on the right front tire may have contributed to the loss of control during braking. Overall, the driver's excessive speed, reckless behavior, and lack of control on a curved road make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
