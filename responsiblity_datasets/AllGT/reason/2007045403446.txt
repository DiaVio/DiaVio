The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not stop before entering it. The driver of V1, an 83-year old female, was coded for driver-related inadequate surveillance and failed to look or see the approaching V2. Additionally, the driver's physical condition, including hearing difficulties and previous heart problems, may have contributed to her failure to properly observe the intersection. V2 (the Pontiac Grand Am) was traveling within the speed limit and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and veering slightly to the right. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident.
