The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was traveling eastbound in the alleyway and intending to turn left at the intersection. However, they failed to see Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2003 Hyundai Accent, 4-door sedan, which was already crossing their path in the southbound lane. As a result, the front right of V2 struck the right plane of V1, causing V1 to rotate and collide with Vehicle 3 (V3), the 1991 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan. Therefore, the failure of the driver of V2 to yield the right of way and properly observe the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
