The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 swerved to avoid an animal (dog) that approached or entered the travel path of the vehicle. As a result of this swerving maneuver, Vehicle 1 departed the access lane and collided with the concrete base of a parking lot lamp pole. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
