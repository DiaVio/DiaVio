The driver of V1 stated that he was unable to slow down for the traffic ahead and slid into the eastbound lanes, striking V2 head-on. The police charged him with driving faster than conditions allowed and failure to drive within lane lines. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the critical reason for this event was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the wet road conditions and maintain control of their vehicle within their lane.
