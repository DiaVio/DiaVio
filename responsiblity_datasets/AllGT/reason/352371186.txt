The reason for this is that the impact was a near side impact with the frontal plane of the Hyundai Santa Fe, indicating that the Subaru Forester (V1) was struck by the Hyundai Santa Fe. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the case occupant, such as the fractures and contusions, were likely a result of contact with the Hyundai Santa Fe's door panel and A-pillar.
