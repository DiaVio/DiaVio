The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling northbound and failed to stop in time to avoid a collision with Vehicle 3, which was stopped behind other vehicles at the south side of the intersection. Vehicle 2 attempted to steer to the left and brake, but was unable to avoid impact and collided with the back left of Vehicle 3. After this initial impact, Vehicle 2 continued across the double yellow line and collided with the front left of Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 2's failure to stop in time and subsequent collision with both Vehicle 3 and Vehicle 1 indicates that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
