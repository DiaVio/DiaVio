The reason for this is that V2 departed from its lane to the left, crossed the centerline, and entered the eastbound travel lane where Vehicle 1 (V1) was traveling. V1 attempted to avoid V2 by braking and steering right, but V2 also entered the shoulder, resulting in a collision between the front of V1 and the front of V2. This indicates that V2's actions of crossing the centerline and entering the eastbound travel lane caused the collision.
