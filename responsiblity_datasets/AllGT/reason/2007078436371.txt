The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. This is evident from the statement provided by the driver of V1, who admitted to not seeing the other car coming. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, further supporting their responsibility for the accident.
