The reason for this is that the driver fell asleep while driving, which was the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to falling asleep despite having a long sleep prior to the crash. This indicates a lack of attentiveness and awareness while operating the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's confusion about the day and time of the crash suggests possible cognitive impairment or fatigue. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's negligence in falling asleep while driving.
