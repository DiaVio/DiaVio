The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a false assumption of the other driver's actions. V1 stated that a westbound vehicle slowed down and waived them across the intersection, leading them to assume that the intersection was clear. However, this assumption was incorrect, as V2 (the driver of the 2004 Dodge Grand Caravan) was approaching in lane one and collided with V1. V1 failed to properly assess the situation and did not see V2 until the collision occurred. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to yield the right of way to V2 make them primarily responsible for the accident.
