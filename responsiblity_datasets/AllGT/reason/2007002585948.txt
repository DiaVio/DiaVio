The driver of Vehicle #1 was cited for intoxication and speeding, indicating that their actions contributed to the crash. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event was coded as "vehicle control loss, traveling too fast for conditions" and the Critical Reason was "driver related factor, aggressive driving behavior." These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle #1 was driving recklessly and at an excessive speed, which led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the guardrail. Furthermore, the driver's statement about a motorcycle cutting them off and causing the crash does not align with the evidence and the sequence of events described. The presence of a summons for speeding on the seat of Vehicle #1 also suggests a pattern of irresponsible driving behavior. Therefore, based on the driver's actions, the police citations, and the evidence provided, Vehicle #1 (the 2006 Nissan 350Z) is primarily responsible for the crash.
