The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Chevy C-1500 Pickup) who was already in the intersection. V1 stopped at the stop sign but entered the roadway without properly checking for oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V1 was the vehicle traveling and crossing the intersection. This further supports the conclusion that V1 failed to yield to V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance are the primary reasons for the accident.
