The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver of V1 stated that she looked left and right before entering the intersection but did not see V2 (the 1999 Pontiac Sunfire). This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming vehicle. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," further suggesting that V1 was the one who initiated the movement into the intersection. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
