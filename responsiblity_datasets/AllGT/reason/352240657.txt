The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the wrong direction (westbound in the eastbound travel lanes) for an unknown reason, possibly due to driver fatigue. This action directly led to the collision with the termination end of a guardrail, resulting in the driver's injuries and damage to the vehicle.
