The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver swerved to avoid the deer, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and slide through the median. This loss of control ultimately led to the vehicle tripping over its right wheels and rolling multiple times before coming to rest in the westbound lanes. The fact that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent the rollover indicates a lack of proper handling and caution, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
