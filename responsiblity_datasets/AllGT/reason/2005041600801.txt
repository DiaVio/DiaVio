The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 (V2) while attempting to make a left-hand turn. V1 turned into the left side of V2, resulting in a sideswipe collision. Additionally, V1 was issued a ticket for a left turn violation and for having an invalid driver's license. The driver of V1 also demonstrated a false assumption of other road users' actions by assuming that having a green light gave him the right of way. Furthermore, it was noted that the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the rules of the road and rarely drove on that roadway.
