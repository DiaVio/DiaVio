The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway, entered a brush-filled wooded area, and collided with multiple trees before ultimately striking a larger tree with its front right plane and axle. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with the tree.
