The reason for this is that V1 was the one who made an incorrect evasive action by steering left abruptly to avoid NCV2. This action caused V1 to travel over the center line and collide with V2. Additionally, V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," further indicating their responsibility in the crash.
