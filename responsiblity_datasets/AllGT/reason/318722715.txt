The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed into the oncoming lane of travel, indicating a failure to maintain proper control and stay within its designated lane. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer right resulted in a clockwise yaw, further indicating a loss of control. Ultimately, Vehicle 1 departed the road and collided with a large tree, causing severe injuries to the driver.
