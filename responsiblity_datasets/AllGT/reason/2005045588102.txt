The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and made a decision error by entering the curve at a speed that caused the vehicle to slide clockwise. This resulted in the vehicle losing control and crossing into the eastbound lane. The driver then overcompensated, causing the vehicle to return to the westbound lanes before ultimately departing the right side of the road and colliding with a utility pole. The driver's hurry to reach a business appointment also contributed to the decision error.
