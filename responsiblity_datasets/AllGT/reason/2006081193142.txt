The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the unknown loss of control. While there are contributing factors such as wet roads, under-inflated rear tire, low tread depth on rear tires, and potentially traveling above the posted speed limit, the exact cause of V1's initial loss of control is unknown. Without further information, it is difficult to determine if there were any human factors involved in V1's control loss.
