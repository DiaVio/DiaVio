The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by reaching for compact disks while negotiating curves in the road. This distraction caused V1 to initially depart the road on the right side. Although the driver attempted to correct the situation by jerking the steering wheel, she overcorrected and lost control of the vehicle. This ultimately led to V1 departing the left side of the roadway and colliding with a tree. Therefore, V1's distraction and subsequent loss of control are the primary factors that led to the accident.
