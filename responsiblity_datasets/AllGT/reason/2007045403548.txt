The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by an animal in the roadway, which caused her to focus on it instead of paying attention to the traffic ahead. This distraction led to her failing to notice that V2 (the Ford Expedition) was stopped in front of her, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she applied her brakes with lockup but was unable to avoid striking V2, indicating a lack of proper control of her vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
