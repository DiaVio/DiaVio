The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop for traffic and collided with the rear of V2 (the 1990 Honda Accord). This indicates that V1 was not paying attention to the road and was distracted by reaching down to retrieve her infant son's bottle while talking to him. The fact that V1 had an interrupted sleep pattern, averaging only five hours of sleep a night, and had taken Ibuprofen for a slight cold, suggests that she may have been fatigued and not fully alert at the time of the crash. Additionally, the coding of "internal distraction" and "inadequate surveillance" as associative factors further support V1's responsibility. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in lane one, in front of V1, and had been stopped for 5-10 seconds before the crash. While V2 may have been involved in the chain reaction collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to stop for traffic and causing the initial impact. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash due to her failure to stop for traffic and being distracted while driving.
