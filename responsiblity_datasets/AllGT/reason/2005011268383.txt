The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle on the loose gravel, which indicates a lack of proper control and skill in driving. Additionally, the driver was not complying with the corrective lenses restriction and was wearing non-prescription sunglasses instead. The over-inflated tires and reduced coefficient of friction on the freshly applied gravel also contributed to the loss of control. The high rate of speed observed by a witness further suggests that the driver was not exercising caution and was potentially driving recklessly.
