The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and then departed the south edge of the roadway, ultimately resulting in a rollover event. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the collision with the embankment and subsequent rollover.
