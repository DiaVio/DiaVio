The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2 (the 1997 Dodge Caravan) and failed to maintain a safe distance. When V2 decelerated due to traffic ahead, V1 was unable to react in time and collided with the back left of V2. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to respond to the unexpected actions of V2. Additionally, V1's attempt to avoid the collision by braking and steering left resulted in a clockwise yaw, causing V1 to strike V3 (the 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe) on its left side. This further demonstrates V1's failure to maintain control of their vehicle and avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the actions of other vehicles make them primarily responsible for the accident.
