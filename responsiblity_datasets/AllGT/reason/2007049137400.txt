The driver of V1 admitted to being momentarily inattentive and not accurately judging her position relative to the median while changing lanes. Additionally, she was engaged in distracting activities such as talking on her cell phone and applying make-up at the time of the crash. These internal distractions caused her to drive off the left side of the roadway onto the median, resulting in the collision with the concrete light pole base. Therefore, the driver's negligence and failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
