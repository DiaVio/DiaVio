The reason for this is that V1's driver stated that he was cut off by another vehicle, which caused him to crash into the back of V2 (the 1987 International refrigerated M/H Truck). However, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, and the critical reason was coded as an insufficient avoidance maneuver. This suggests that the driver of V1 could have braked as soon as the non-contact vehicle entered his lane, which would have prevented V1 from striking V2. Therefore, V1's failure to take appropriate action to avoid the collision makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
