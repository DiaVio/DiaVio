The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize and react to the slowing traffic ahead, indicating a lack of caution and anticipation. There were no avoidance actions taken by V1, suggesting that the driver was traveling too fast to anticipate the sudden stop of the forward traffic. Additionally, the lack of interview information and the driver's avoidance of interviews make it difficult to determine any external or internal distractions that may have contributed to the driver's failure to recognize the situation. Therefore, based on the available information, V1's failure to react to the slowing traffic and misjudgment of the speed and gap distance of the forward vehicle make them primarily responsible for the collision.
