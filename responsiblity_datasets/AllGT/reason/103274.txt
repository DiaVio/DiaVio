The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to veer left-of-center, cross the eastbound lane, and ultimately collide with two large trees. This indicates a lack of control and negligence on the part of the driver, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
