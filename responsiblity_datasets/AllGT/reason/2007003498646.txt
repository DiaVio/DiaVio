The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 reported that V2 (the Harley-Davidson motorcycle) cut him off, causing him to lose control and collide with the utility pole and the pedestrian. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way.
