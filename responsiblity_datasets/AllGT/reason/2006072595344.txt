The reason for this determination is that V1 swerved over the centerline and crashed into a building on the east side of the roadway. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, with the critical reason being an unknown type of driver error. This suggests that the driver of V1 made an error that caused the vehicle to veer off the road and ultimately crash into the building.
