The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 apparently had a seizure and lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with various objects, including a mailbox, a fence, and ultimately a pole. The driver's loss of control and subsequent collisions indicate that Vehicle 1 was the primary cause of the accident.
