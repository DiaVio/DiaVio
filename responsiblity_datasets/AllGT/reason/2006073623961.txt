The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. When the light turned green, V1 accelerated in anticipation of V2 moving forward as well. However, V2 did not immediately move forward, resulting in V1 striking the rear of V2. V2's driver was distracted by looking at a previous crash to his left, which delayed his movement when the light turned green. While this may have contributed to the accident, V1's false assumption and subsequent collision make them primarily responsible.
