The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted to change lanes to the right without ensuring it was safe to do so. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event coded as "This vehicle traveling - over lane line on right side of travel lane" and the critical reason coded as "Aggressive Driving Behavior". V1's decision to aggressively change lanes without proper caution resulted in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1992 Buick LeSabre) stated that V1 cut right in front of him and that he applied his brakes but couldn't avoid the collision. However, since V1's actions of changing lanes aggressively and crossing over the lane line were the primary cause of the crash, V2's inability to avoid the collision does not absolve V1 of their responsibility.
