The reason for this is that V2 was crossing straight through the intersection while V1, the Honda Civic sedan, was making a left turn. V2's front impacted the left side of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. This failure to yield resulted in the collision and subsequent severe injuries to the occupant of V1.
