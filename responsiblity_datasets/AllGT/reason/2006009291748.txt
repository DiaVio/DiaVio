The reason for this is that V2, driven by the unidentified male in the white jacket, pulled into the path of V1 while attempting to turn left onto the westbound roadway. This action caused the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V2 fled the scene, leaving the vehicle behind without providing any information. The description given by the driver of V1 supports the belief that the middle-aged male in the white jacket was indeed the driver of V2 and caused the accident.
