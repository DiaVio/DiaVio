The driver of V1 attempted to make a U-turn across the path of V2 without properly assessing the distance and speed of oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 misjudged the gap and made the U-turn at an inappropriate time, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had a tendency to be in a hurry while driving, which could have contributed to the decision to make the U-turn without sufficient caution. While the driver of V2 had a BAC level of .081 and may have been traveling too fast for conditions, it is stated that she saw V1 at the intersection but did not think he was going to pull out in front of her. This suggests that V2 had the right-of-way and was not expecting V1 to make the U-turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap and decision to make a U-turn at an inappropriate time.
