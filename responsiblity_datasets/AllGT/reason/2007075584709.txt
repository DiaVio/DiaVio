The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking in his left side mirrors and dropping his clipboard, which caused him to not notice the stopped traffic ahead. This distraction, along with the driver's failure to look far enough ahead and the congested traffic, contributed to the crash. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 80 kmph, which was the reported travel speed by the police, indicating that V1 was not able to stop in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.
