The driver of Vehicle #2 was attempting to turn left into the gas station from the northbound lanes. However, the driver made a decision error by turning with an obstructed view. This means that the driver did not have a clear line of sight and failed to ensure that it was safe to make the left turn. As a result, Vehicle #1 (1996 Mitsubishi 3000GT) collided with the right-front wheel of Vehicle #2. While there was a sightline restriction for Vehicle #1 due to a non-contact vehicle, it is the responsibility of the driver of Vehicle #2 to ensure that it is safe to make a left turn. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that the driver of the non-contact vehicle allowed him to enter the gas station, indicating that he had an opportunity to assess the situation before making the turn. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error and turning with an obstructed view.
