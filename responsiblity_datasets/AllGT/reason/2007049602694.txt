The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by talking to his girlfriend and not noticing that the signal was red until he was already in the intersection. This internal distraction caused him to fail to yield the right of way and collide with V2. While the sightline restriction created by the hedge was an associated factor in the crash, it does not absolve the driver of V1 from their responsibility to obey traffic signals and exercise caution while driving.
