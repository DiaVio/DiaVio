The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a significantly higher speed (120 kph or 75 mph) compared to V2 (approximately 64 kph or 40 mph). Additionally, V1 was approaching from behind V2 and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the back of V2. The fact that V1 underrode the dump truck further indicates that V1 was at fault for not being able to stop or avoid the collision.
