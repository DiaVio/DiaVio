The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were following too closely to react to unexpected actions. This is evident from the fact that V1 was unable to stop their vehicle in time to avoid hitting V2, even though V2 was able to slow down and avoid hitting the tractor-trailer that reentered the roadway. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that the wet roads caused their vehicle to skid slightly, indicating that they may not have been maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them given the road conditions. While V2 (the driver of the Toyota Tacoma pickup) also had associated factors such as sleep apnea and hypertension, it is important to note that V2 was able to slow down in time to avoid hitting the tractor-trailer. This suggests that V2 was maintaining a safer distance from the vehicle in front of them and was able to react appropriately to the unexpected actions of the tractor-trailer. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to following too closely and not being able to stop in time, even considering the wet road conditions.
