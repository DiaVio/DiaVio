The driver of V1 stated that he was traveling in the HOV lane at a speed of 45 mph (72 kmph) when the vehicle in front of him suddenly braked. Despite the wet road conditions and congested traffic, the driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance of less than five meters between his vehicle and the one in front. This indicates a driver-related decision error of following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to steer left to avoid the other vehicle but ultimately lost control of his vehicle, causing it to make contact with the concrete traffic barrier and roll onto its roof. This suggests a lack of proper control and handling of the vehicle in response to the situation. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the critical pre-crash event and reason provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
