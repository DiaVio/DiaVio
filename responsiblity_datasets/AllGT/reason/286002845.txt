The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a left turn and crossed into the path of Vehicle 1 (CV), the 2002 four door Cadillac Escalade, resulting in the front plane of V2 impacting the left side plane of CV. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to CV, causing the collision.
