The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicles ahead in time and was distracted by a conversation with the passenger. This recognition error and internal distraction led to the driver not paying attention to the road and being unaware of the traffic situation ahead. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle and relatively low frequency of driving on that particular roadway may have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's recognition error, internal distraction, and failure to stop in time.
