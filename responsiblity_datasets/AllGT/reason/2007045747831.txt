The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive and failed to notice that V2 had stopped in the traffic lane ahead of him until just a second before the impact. Additionally, the driver claimed to be traveling at a speed of 80 kmph (50 mph), which may have been too fast for the conditions and the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). The driver's inattention, combined with the failure to notice the stopped vehicle and the inability to stop in time, led to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the Honda Accord) also bears some responsibility for the accident. The driver made an illegal maneuver by stopping in a lane of a high-speed interstate highway, which is a dangerous action. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and reliance on the passenger for directions contributed to the lack of awareness and failure to take evasive actions before being struck. In summary, while both drivers share some responsibility for the accident, V1 is primarily responsible due to inattention and failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead.
