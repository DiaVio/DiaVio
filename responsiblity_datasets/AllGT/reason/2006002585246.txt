The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain proper control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. The driver stated that she was traveling at 20 MPH, which may have been too fast for the wet road conditions. Additionally, the driver mentioned that her tire blew out, which could have further contributed to the loss of control. Furthermore, the driver's lack of experience and recent acquisition of her driver's license may have played a role in her inability to properly handle the situation. The police report also indicated that unsafe speed was a factor, and a witness stated that Vehicle 1 was operating too fast. Overall, the combination of insufficient steering and braking inputs, wet road conditions, and the driver's lack of experience and control led to the accident, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible.
