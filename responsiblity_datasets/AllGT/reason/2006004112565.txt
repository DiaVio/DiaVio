The reason for this is that V1 ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver of V1 admitted to not noticing if any cars on his side of the road were entering the intersection and claimed to have never stopped or slowed down when approaching the intersection because he believed he had a green light the whole time. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inattentive to the driving task, as he was preoccupied with thoughts unrelated to driving. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and lack of attention to the road make them primarily responsible for the accident.
