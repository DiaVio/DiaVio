The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it failed to stop for the stop sign and entered the intersection illegally. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by holding an open candy bar containing nuts, despite having a severe allergy to nuts. This distraction and the physical effects of the allergy likely contributed to the decision error of running the stop sign.
