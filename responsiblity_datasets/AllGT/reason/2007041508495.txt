The driver of V1 was backing out of a driveway onto the roadway and failed to adequately survey the area before doing so. The driver's view was obstructed by a parked mail truck, which was a sight restriction. Additionally, the driver was engaged in a social conversation with the passenger, which may have distracted him from properly checking for oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, decision to back into the roadway with an obstructed view, and inexperience as a newly licensed driver.
