The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to being distracted by sun glare and did not realize they had crossed over the left lane line. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not paying attention to the road and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2. Additionally, Vehicle 1 refused inspection of their vehicle, which suggests a lack of cooperation and responsibility. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle 2 stated that they had moved onto the shoulder of the roadway to avoid the impact but ran out of room due to the line of large trees. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 2 took evasive action to avoid the collision, but was unable to completely avoid it due to the actions of Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to keep right and their admitted distraction.
