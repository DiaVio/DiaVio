The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep, causing V1 to drift out of its lane and collide with the back left corner of V2, a 1995 Freightliner tractor pulling a 1998 Great Dane flatbed trailer. This resulted in severe vehicle damage and serious spine injury to the front right seat passenger of V1.
