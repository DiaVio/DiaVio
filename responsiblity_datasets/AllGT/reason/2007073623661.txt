The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver's inadequate surveillance, inexperience, and distraction from conversing with her passenger were all contributing factors to the crash. V1 stated that she looked for traffic but did not see V2 prior to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle resulted in the crash.
