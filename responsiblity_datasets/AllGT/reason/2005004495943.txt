The reason for this is that V1, the 17-year-old female driver, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She looked but did not see V2 approaching in the southbound lane, resulting in the front of V1 striking the right side of V2. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2.
