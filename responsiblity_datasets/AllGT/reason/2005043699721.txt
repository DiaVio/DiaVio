The reason for this is that V2 was stopped at a crossing street facing east and proceeded to cross the roadway without properly judging the gap or the speed of oncoming traffic. This decision error led to V1 (the driver of the Ford Explorer) colliding with the left rear of V2. It is important to note that V1 stated that a vehicle from a crossing street on the right attempted to cross the road in front of him, but since V2 was facing east and crossed the roadway, it is likely that V1's statement is inaccurate or there may have been another vehicle involved that was not mentioned in the case summary. However, based on the given information, V2's decision error is the primary cause of the accident.
