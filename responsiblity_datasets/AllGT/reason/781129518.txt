The reason for this is that V1 crossed the median and traveled into the southbound lane, causing the collision with V2 (the 2007 Mercedes Benz CLK550). V2's driver observed V1 crossing into their lane and attempted to avoid the collision by slowing down and steering to the right. However, V1 was already fully in the southbound lane and the driver of V1 attempted to steer back into the northbound lane, resulting in the front of V1 striking the front of V2. This indicates that V1 was at fault for crossing into the opposing lane and causing the collision.
