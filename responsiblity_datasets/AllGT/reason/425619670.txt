The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the center line and began traveling partially in the oncoming lane of travel, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2 (the 2006 Ford F-150 large pickup). This indicates that Vehicle 1 was in the wrong lane and caused the crash by entering the path of Vehicle 2.
