The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 22-year-old female, admitted to seeing the yellow light but decided to continue into the intersection instead of stopping. This decision to disregard the traffic control device and proceed through the intersection illegally led to the collision with V2. V1's illegal maneuver of failing to stop for the traffic light was the critical pre-crash event and a driver-related decision error.
