The reason for this is that V2 initiated a left turn from the southbound lane, encroaching into the northbound lane where V1 was intending to make a left-hand turn. V2's false assumption of V1's actions, despite seeing V1 signal a left turn, led to the collision. Additionally, V2 did not begin braking until one second prior to impact, indicating a lack of attention and reaction time.
