The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver entered the intersection without slowing down and claimed to have a green light, despite a witness stating that V1 had a red light for 2-3 seconds. The critical reason for V1 was coded as a "decision error-illegal maneuver." This indicates that V1 made an illegal maneuver by entering the intersection against a red light, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and make an illegal maneuver makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
