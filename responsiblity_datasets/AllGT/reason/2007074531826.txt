The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the south side of the east/west roadway, striking various objects such as a sign, a ditch, a steel cable traffic barrier, and a chain-link fence. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; end departure," indicating that V1 veered off the road. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; inattention (i.e. daydreaming)," suggesting that the driver was not paying attention while driving. Additionally, the driver's wife mentioned that he did not recall the details of the crash but remembered realizing that he "missed his turn." This indicates a lack of focus and attention on the road. Furthermore, the driver admitted to traveling above the speed limit due to being late for work, which suggests a disregard for traffic laws. The driver's fatigue, as mentioned by his wife, could have also contributed to the crash. Fatigue can impair a driver's reaction time and decision-making abilities, making them more prone to accidents. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention, speeding, and potential fatigue.
