The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was distracted and not paying attention to the road. Just prior to the crash, she was looking inside her vehicle, which indicates a lack of focus on the road ahead. Although she looked back up at the roadway at the last minute, it was too late to avoid the collision. This distraction caused her to fail to notice that V1 had come to a stop due to traffic conditions, resulting in the collision.
