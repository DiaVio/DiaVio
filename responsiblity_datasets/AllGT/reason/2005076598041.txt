The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at excessive speed, which caused the vehicle to drift over the right fog line and onto the shoulder. Additionally, the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, as evidenced by the multiple rotations and loss of control. The driver's admission of fatigue further suggests a lack of attentiveness and impaired driving ability. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, poor directional control, and potential fatigue.
