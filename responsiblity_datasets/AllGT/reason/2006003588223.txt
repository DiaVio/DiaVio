The Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V1 was inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, there were no known associated factors coded to V1, as the driver refused to be interviewed regarding the crash.
