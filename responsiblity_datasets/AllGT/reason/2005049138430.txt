The reason for this is that V1 departed its original travel lane to the left and struck the back of V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Silverado). V1 then returned to the third travel lane and struck the left side of V3 (the 1990 Toyota Corolla). Since V1 was the vehicle that initiated the collision by departing its lane and striking the other vehicles, it is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
