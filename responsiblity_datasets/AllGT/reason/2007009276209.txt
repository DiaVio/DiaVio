The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Ford Taurus, was exiting a driveway and failed to notice V1, the Isuzu Rodeo, when pulling out. V2 began her right turn without having a clear view of oncoming traffic due to the obstructed sightline caused by the brick pillars. Additionally, V2 was distracted by being on a cell phone, which further contributed to the driver-related error. The icy road conditions and sightline obstruction were also factors associated with V2's responsibility for the accident.
