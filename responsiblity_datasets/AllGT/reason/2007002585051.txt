The reason for this is that the witness behind V1 stated that the vehicle had been drifting from one side of the lane to the other for quite some distance. Just prior to the crash, V1 sped up and crossed into the oncoming lane without making any attempt to avoid V2 or using brake lights. This indicates that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and made a reckless maneuver, resulting in the collision.
