The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not notice V2 (the 2002 Dodge Dakota) approaching in the number one lane. Additionally, V1 attempted to execute a right turn from the number two travel lane, which is a violation of traffic rules. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and awareness, leading to the collision.
