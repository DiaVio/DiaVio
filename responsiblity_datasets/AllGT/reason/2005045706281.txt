The reason for this is as follows: - Vehicle 1 crossed the dashed line to its right and impacted the left rear side of Vehicle 2, indicating a lane encroachment. - The driver of Vehicle 1 was charged with DUI and had narcotics in his system, indicating impaired driving. - The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle 1 was "This vehicle traveling: Over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," indicating a recognition error and internal distraction. - Another contributing factor for Vehicle 1 was poor directional control and fatigue, as the driver had slept only 2 Â½ hours before the crash and was in a hurry to get home. - The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to being on the phone just before the crash, which could have contributed to the distraction and loss of control. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to impaired driving, lane encroachment, recognition error, distraction, and poor directional control.
