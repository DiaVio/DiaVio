The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle traveling and crossing over the intersection, which was the critical pre-crash event. Additionally, the driver of V2 was found to have inadequate surveillance and was daydreaming, which was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. This indicates that the driver of V2 was not paying attention and failed to properly observe the intersection before crossing it, leading to the collision with V1.
