The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted while lighting a cigarette and looking down inside the vehicle. This internal distraction caused V1 to gradually depart from the right road edge, leading to the crash. Additionally, the driver's refusal to be interviewed and allow the vehicle to be inspected suggests a lack of cooperation, which further supports V1's responsibility.
