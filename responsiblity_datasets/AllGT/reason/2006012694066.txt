The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included a wet roadway due to heavy rain. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced, having only had a license for 12 months. The broken sway bar in V1 may have also contributed to the loss of control. Finally, the driver's panic and decision to let go of the steering wheel when she saw the semi truck further contributed to the crash.
