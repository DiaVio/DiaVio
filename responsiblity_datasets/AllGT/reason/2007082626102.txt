The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the path of V1. As a result, the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. Since V2 was the vehicle encroaching into the opposite lane, it can be concluded that V2 is primarily responsible for the collision.
