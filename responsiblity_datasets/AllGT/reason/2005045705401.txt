The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was making a left turn into the access road from the northbound left turn lane, and it impacted front to front with Vehicle #1, which was traveling south. Vehicle #2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #1, as it pulled out in front of Vehicle #1 without a turn signal. This action by Vehicle #2 caused the collision. Additionally, the associated factors coded to the driver of Vehicle #2, such as driver fatigue, nearsightedness without corrective lenses, smoking a cigarette, misjudging the speed of Vehicle #1, and taking a prescription birth control pill, may have contributed to the driver's decision error and false assumption of other road users' actions. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and the associated factors that may have influenced the driver's decision-making abilities.
