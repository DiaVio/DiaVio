The reason for this is that V2, the 1999 Plymouth Voyager, was stopped at the stop sign and turned right into the roadway without properly judging the gap or the speed of V1. This misjudgment of the gap or other's speed is a driver-related factor and indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
