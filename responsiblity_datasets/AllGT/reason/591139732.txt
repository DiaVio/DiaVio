The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it crossed fully into the oncoming southbound lane, into the path of V2 (the 2005 Nissan Altima). V2's driver attempted to avoid the collision by steering left, but V1's front end still struck the front of V2. This indicates that V1 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain its proper position on the road, resulting in the head-on collision.
