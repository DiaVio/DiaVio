The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 and turned in front of V2, causing the collision. V1's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed is considered a driver-related factor and the critical reason for the pre-crash event. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any critical reason coded to their vehicle. They attempted to avoid the crash by steering right and applying the brakes, indicating that they were taking appropriate actions to prevent the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their misjudgment of the gap or other's speed while making a left turn at the intersection.
