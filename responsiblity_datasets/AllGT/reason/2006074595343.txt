The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to make a left turn. Despite noticing V2, the driver of V1 believed there was enough time to complete the turn before V2 reached the intersection. This misjudgment led to the collision between the front of V1 and the left side of V2. V2, on the other hand, reacted appropriately by steering right and applying the brakes to avoid the collision. The driver of V2 realized that V1 was going to turn in front of their vehicle and took evasive action. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
