The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph) and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the logs extending off the back of V2's trailer. V1's inability to stop suggests that the driver may have been following too closely or not paying sufficient attention to the road conditions, such as the foggy weather and the deceleration of V2 ahead.
