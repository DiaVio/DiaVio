The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, resulting in inadequate surveillance and a driver error. This is supported by the fact that V1's Critical Precrash Event was "This Vehicle Traveling, turning left at intersection" and the Critical Reason was "Inadequate Surveillance (failed to look)". Additionally, witnesses confirmed that V1 crossed multiple lanes of traffic and caused significant damage to both vehicles.
