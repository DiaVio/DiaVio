The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a significantly higher speed (150 kph or 93 mph) compared to the estimated speed of V2 (97 kmph or 60 mph). Additionally, V1 struck the back of V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision.
