The driver of V1 admits to not seeing V2 until it was right in front of her vehicle, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over left lane line," suggesting that V1 crossed into the lane of V2, causing the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was making a right turn into a driveway, which is a legal maneuver. The Critical Reason for V2 was coded as "misjudgment of gap or velocity," indicating that V2 may have misjudged the distance or speed of V1, but this does not absolve V1 of responsibility for failing to yield or avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's lack of attention and encroachment into the adjacent lane.
