The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 drifted into the lane of V1, causing V1 to take evasive actions and ultimately lose control on the icy shoulder. V2's poor directional control while negotiating the left curve of the roadway, coupled with drifting into the adjacent lane, contributed to the crash.
