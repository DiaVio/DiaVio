The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart the right pavement edge and subsequently collided with two W-beam guardrails. The driver's lack of restraint use, evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seatbelt system, indicates a failure to take necessary precautions to prevent the accident. Additionally, contact evidence suggests that the driver was in a slumped posture, possibly asleep, at the time of the collision, further indicating a lack of attentiveness and control over the vehicle.
