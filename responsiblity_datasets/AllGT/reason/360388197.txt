The reason for this is that V2 impacted the left side of V1, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise and sustain damage. V2 continued traveling forward after the initial impact, indicating that it failed to yield or stop at the stop sign present on the intersecting east/west asphalt roadway. This failure to yield or stop resulted in the collision with V1, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
