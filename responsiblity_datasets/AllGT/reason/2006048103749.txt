The reason for V1's responsibility is that they attempted to turn left at the intersection from the southbound lane, which resulted in a collision with V2 (the driver of the 1997 Acura 3.2TL). V1's action of turning left from the lane designated for through traffic is a violation of traffic rules and is considered an improper maneuver. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 is coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that there was some form of driver error on the part of V1, although the specific details are not provided. Overall, V1's decision to turn left from the southbound lane and the lack of information regarding any mitigating circumstances or errors on the part of V2 indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
