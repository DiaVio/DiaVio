The reason for this is that V1 swerved into the northern parking lane and impacted the left side of V2, which was legally parked. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and failed to stay within the travel lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 fled the scene further suggests their responsibility for the accident.
