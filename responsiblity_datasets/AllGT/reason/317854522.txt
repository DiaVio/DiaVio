The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop in time and avoid contacting the vehicle ahead, resulting in V1 steering onto the roadside, contacting a ditch, and subsequently hitting a mailbox. This indicates that V1 was following too closely or not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a violation of traffic laws and a common cause of rear-end collisions.
