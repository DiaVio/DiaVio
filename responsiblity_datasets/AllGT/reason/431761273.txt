The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unrestrained, which is evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the driver's seat belt system. The lack of restraint use indicates that the driver was not properly secured in the vehicle, which could have contributed to the severity of her injuries. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to continue in a forward tracking mode and depart the south pavement edge, resulting in a series of collisions with roadside signposts, a silt fence, and ultimately, two large diameter trees. These collisions caused moderate overlapping damage to the front of the vehicle. Therefore, the combination of the driver's lack of restraint use and failure to maintain control of the vehicle makes Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
