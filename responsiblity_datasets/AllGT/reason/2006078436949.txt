The reason for V-1's responsibility is that it drifted to the right side of the roadway and struck the rear of V-2 (the 1995 Geo Metro coupe). V-1 continued to push V-2 for approximately 35 meters before V-2 came to a stop. V-1's failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within the lane resulted in the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event is listed as a driver-related factor of "Internal distraction." This suggests that the driver of V-1 was distracted internally, which likely contributed to the drifting and subsequent collision with V-2. Overall, V-1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, drifting into the right side of the roadway, and the internal distraction of the driver make V-1 primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
