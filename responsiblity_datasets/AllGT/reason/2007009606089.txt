The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an unsafe lane change without properly checking for other vehicles, resulting in a collision with V2. The driver of V1 then overcompensated by jerking the wheel to the right and then to the left, causing V1 to lose control and collide with V2 again. This sequence of actions by the driver of V1 ultimately led to the collision and subsequent rotation of both vehicles.
