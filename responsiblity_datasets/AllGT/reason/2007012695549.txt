The reason for this is that V1 lost control of her vehicle due to hydroplaning on the wet road. She hit a puddle of water, which caused her to start hydroplaning and ultimately spin into the path of V2. V1's loss of control and subsequent spin into the other lane initiated the chain of events that led to the collision with V2 and V3.
