The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was reportedly inattentive and struck the rear of V1. This impact caused V1 to lose control and enter into the westbound lane, resulting in the collision with V3. Therefore, the inattentiveness of the driver of V2 initiated the chain of events that led to the accident.
