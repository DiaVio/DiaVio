The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign posted at the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the stop sign and claimed to be looking for a particular street sign instead. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. While the pre-crash factors for V2 (the driver of the Ford F-series pickup) are unknown, it is stated that V2 was traveling in the correct lane and did not encroach into the path of V1. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be a contributing factor to the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance.
