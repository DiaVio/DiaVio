The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and keep it on the roadway. The driver admitted to drifting off the edge of the road and attempting to pull the vehicle back onto the road but was unsuccessful. This poor directional control led to the vehicle contacting a street sign and ultimately falling off the road into a creek bed. Additionally, the driver's engagement in other non-driving activities, such as delivering and possibly sorting mail while driving, contributed to the poor directional control. This distraction likely affected the driver's ability to focus on the road and maintain proper control of the vehicle. Furthermore, the roadway-related factors, including the lack of clear definition of the road, non-existent shoulders, and the presence of a hidden drainage pipe, may have contributed to the driver's difficulty in maintaining control. However, the primary responsibility still lies with V1 as the driver should have exercised caution and adapted to the road conditions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, engagement in non-driving activities, and the inability to adapt to the roadway conditions.
