The reason for this is that the driver of V2 moved into the westbound lane to pass slower traffic, which is a dangerous maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V2 failed to anticipate the presence of V1, which was traveling in the westbound lane. This lack of awareness and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision between V1 and V2.
