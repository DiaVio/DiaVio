The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it made an improper right turn onto the eastbound lane and then proceeded to make a U-turn into the westbound lane, ultimately colliding with the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2), the tractor-trailer combination. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 and did not exercise proper caution while making the turn, resulting in the collision.
