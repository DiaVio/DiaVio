The driver of V1 was inattentive to the driving task and failed to brake in time to avoid striking the rear of V2. This lack of attention and delayed reaction led to the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not locking up the brakes even when V2 had slowed almost to a stop, indicating inadequate evasive action. The impact between V1 and V2 then caused V1 to veer into oncoming traffic and collide with V3. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to react appropriately to the situation make them primarily responsible for the accident.
