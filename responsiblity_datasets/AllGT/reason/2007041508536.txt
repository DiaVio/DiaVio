The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a driver-related performance error by overcompensating when trying to avoid the motorcycle. The driver misjudged the high rate of speed at which the motorcycle was traveling and swerved to the right at the last second, causing them to lose control of the vehicle and collide with the concrete traffic barriers on both sides of the roadway.
