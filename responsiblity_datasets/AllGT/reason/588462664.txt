The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling southbound in the left southbound through lane and struck the left side of Vehicle 1 (the 2011 BMW 335d 4-door sedan) as it was turning left at the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
