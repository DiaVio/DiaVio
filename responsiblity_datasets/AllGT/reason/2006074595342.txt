The critical pre-crash event for V2 was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was attributed to inadequate surveillance. This means that the driver of V2 failed to properly look or failed to see the oncoming vehicle (V1) before making the left turn. This lack of attention and failure to yield the right of way resulted in the collision with V1.
