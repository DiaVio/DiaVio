The driver of V2 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being coded as "too fast for conditions." Additionally, the driver of V2 did not realize that caution was required, which further contributed to the accident. The wet roads, newly added bicycle lane, and rain were coded as roadway and weather-related factors, which may have affected the overall conditions of the road. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their speed and driving behavior accordingly. In contrast, V1 (the Honda Passport) was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane - over left lane line." This suggests that V1 was driving normally and was impacted by V2 from the rear. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the conditions and failing to exercise caution.
