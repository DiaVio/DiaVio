The reason for this is that Vehicle two attempted a lane change into the left lane without properly checking their blind spot and failed to see Vehicle one (the 1995 Nissan Maxima) attempting to pass. This resulted in the front of Vehicle two contacting the back of Vehicle one, causing the accident. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "driver related error: unknown recognition error," indicating that the driver of Vehicle two made an error in recognizing the presence of Vehicle one. Therefore, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly check their blind spot and recognize the presence of Vehicle one before attempting the lane change.
