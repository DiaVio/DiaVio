The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 105 km/h (exceeding the speed limit of 104 km/h) in poor road conditions caused by standing water. V1's front tires contacted a standing puddle of water, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and lose control. Despite attempting to regain control by letting off the gas pedal and steering left, V1's front tires suddenly regained traction, resulting in a violent clockwise rotation towards the embankment. This loss of control and subsequent collision with the embankment was primarily caused by V1's excessive speed for the road conditions and poor directional control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driving too fast for the conditions and poor directional control.
