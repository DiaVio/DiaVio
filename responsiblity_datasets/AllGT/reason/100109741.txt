The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to negotiate the right curve at the top of the hillcrest and continued straight, causing the vehicle to travel across the roadway and leave the opposite side. This decision led to V1 colliding with various objects, including an overhanging mail box, a telephone utility equipment post, and a large rock. The driver's attempt to steer right to avoid a collision with a brick fence line further contributed to the accident. Ultimately, V1 overturned multiple times and collided with a parked vehicle. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to navigate the curve and subsequent collision with various objects.
