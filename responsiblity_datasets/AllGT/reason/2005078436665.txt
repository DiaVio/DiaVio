The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light while other traffic was stopped. This is considered an illegal maneuver and shows a disregard for traffic laws and the safety of other drivers on the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a history of DUI arrests and left the scene of the accident, further demonstrating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
