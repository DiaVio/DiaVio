The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a U-turn in front of V2, failing to yield the right-of-way. This illegal maneuver and failure to yield resulted in the collision between the front of V2 and the right rear of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was a 17-year old with less than one year of driving experience, which suggests a possible factor of inexperience contributing to the decision error.
