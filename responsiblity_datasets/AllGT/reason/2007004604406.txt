The reason for this is that all available evidence points to the fact that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and simply departed the roadway. The driver's claims of being forced off the road by an unknown vehicle are inconsistent and unsupported by any scene evidence. Additionally, the driver's medical history, including conditions such as mild dementia, diabetes, hypertension, and syncope, along with the presence of multiple prescription medications, raises concerns about his ability to safely operate a vehicle. Furthermore, the passenger, who was the driver's wife, was unable to verify any of the driver's claims and had no details relating to the events. The lack of any avoidance maneuvers by V1 and the absence of any scene evidence indicating a loss of control further support the conclusion that the driver's poor directional control was the critical reason for the crash. Therefore, V1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
