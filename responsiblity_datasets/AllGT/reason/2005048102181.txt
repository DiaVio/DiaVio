The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a driver recognition error by failing to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see any traffic before proceeding into the intersection, indicating a lack of proper observation. This failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic from the left resulted in the collision with V2 (the 1991 Toyota Corolla), which was already in the westbound lane. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
