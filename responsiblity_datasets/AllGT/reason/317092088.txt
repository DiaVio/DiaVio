The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling at a speed of approximately 80 kph (50 mph) in a posted speed limit zone of 56 kph (35 mph). Additionally, V1 failed to negotiate the right-hand curve, crossed the northbound lane, and went off the road, ultimately colliding with a barbed wire fence and trees. The driver's failure to control the vehicle's speed and navigate the curve appropriately led to the accident.
