The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive maneuver. Instead of safely maneuvering around the animal in the roadway, the driver overcompensated, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle. This ultimately led to V1 departing the roadway, rolling over, and coming to rest on its top.
