The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 collided with Vehicle 1 (2008 Pontiac Grand Prix) while it was attempting to turn left into a business driveway. Vehicle 2 was traveling in the southbound lane and impacted the front right area of Vehicle 1, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and both vehicles to be redirected towards the southwest. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
