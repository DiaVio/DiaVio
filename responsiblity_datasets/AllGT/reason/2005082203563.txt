The reason for this is that V1 was changing lanes and failed to adequately surveil the adjacent lane before doing so. The driver of V1 admitted at the scene that she did not see the other vehicle (V2) before the collision occurred. This indicates a lack of proper observation and caution while changing lanes, resulting in the collision.
