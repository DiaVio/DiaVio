The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn out of the private driveway, intending to go east, and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. Despite the non-contact vehicle in lane one waving V1 on, V1 did not see V2 (the Nissan Altima) in lane two and was unable to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 had limited experience with the vehicle, as it belonged to her daughter and she had only driven it a few times in the past three months. She was also visiting from another state and not familiar with the area, which may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance. The rush-hour congestion and wet road conditions further hindered visibility and may have affected the driver's ability to react in time.
