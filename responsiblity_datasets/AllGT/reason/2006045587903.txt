The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to stop at the intersection, disregarding the stop sign on the side street. This failure to obey the traffic control device led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (1999 Plymouth Voyager) which was traveling on the arterial road. Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver was charged with driving on a revoked license and having no insurance, indicating a lack of responsibility and compliance with traffic laws. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and the associated charges.
