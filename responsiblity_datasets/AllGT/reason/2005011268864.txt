The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a heart attack or other physical impairment, which caused him to lose consciousness just before the crash. This physical condition, coupled with the driver's fatigue from playing golf in hot weather, led to the driver drifting left and ultimately crashing into a tree. Therefore, the driver's physical condition and fatigue were the leading factors in causing the crash.
