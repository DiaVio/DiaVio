The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they changed lanes to the right without adequately surveilling their blind spot, resulting in them striking V2 (the Saturn LS1 sedan). V1 admitted that V2 must have been in their blind spot, indicating a failure to properly check their surroundings before changing lanes. Additionally, the police report does not mention any contributing factors for V2's loss of control other than the fact that the vehicle was equipped with four studded winter tires. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1's failure to properly check their blind spot and safely change lanes makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
