The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the actions of V2. The driver of V1 assumed that V2 was turning right into the same driveway, based on seeing V2's right turn signal. However, V2 was actually continuing forward in the southbound lane. This false assumption led the driver of V1 to make a right turn into lane one, resulting in a collision with V2. Additionally, factors such as the driver's misjudgment of V2's velocity, unfamiliarity with the roadway, and driver inexperience contributed to the driver of V1 being primarily responsible for the accident.
