The reason for this is that V2 was in the process of making a left turn across the two one-way lanes when the collision occurred. V1, the Jeep Liberty, was traveling in its designated lane and had the right of way. V2's action of turning across the lanes without yielding to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision.
