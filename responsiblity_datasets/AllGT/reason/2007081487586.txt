The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a seizure while driving, which impaired his ability to act and resulted in poor directional control. This led to V1 departing the right side of the road, impacting a guardrail, and subsequently colliding with the rear of V2. The driver's reduced mental capabilities and lack of medication for high blood pressure further contributed to the driver's unconscious state prior to the crash events.
