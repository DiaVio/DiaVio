The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 hit the accelerator instead of the brakes when a passenger car crossed in front of them. This poor decision and lack of control over the vehicle led to V1 accelerating through the intersection, leaving the roadway, and ultimately impacting a brick column.
