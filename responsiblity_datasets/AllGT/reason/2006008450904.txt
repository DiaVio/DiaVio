The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the police reported travel speed of 64 kmph (40 mph) in an area with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). Additionally, the driver's inexperience and the wet road conditions may have contributed to the loss of control when the left rear tire blew out.
