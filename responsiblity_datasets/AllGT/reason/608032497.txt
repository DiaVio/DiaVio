The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to avoid a collision by steering to the left and grazed the left-rear bumper of Vehicle 2 (V2). This action caused V1 to lose control and cross the inside lane, ultimately resulting in a collision with the concrete median barrier and flipping over. The driver of V1's attempt to avoid the collision was not successful and ultimately led to the accident.
