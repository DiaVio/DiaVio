The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted by papers flying around in her car and was in the process of closing a window and turning on the air conditioner when the crash occurred. Additionally, the driver only had 11 months of driving experience, which suggests a lack of experience and potentially poor judgment in handling the situation. Vehicle #2 (Toyota Echo) was decelerating in traffic, waiting for another vehicle to make a left turn, and the driver stated that she did not see or have time to react to the impacting vehicle. This indicates that Vehicle #2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related error and internal distraction.
