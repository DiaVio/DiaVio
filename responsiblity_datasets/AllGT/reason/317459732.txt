The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which means it had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V2 (the 2012 Ford Explorer) was traveling in the far right lane of the westbound lanes and was crossing the intersection, which suggests that V2 had the right of way. The front of V1 made contact with the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield and caused the collision.
