The driver of Vehicle #1 was attempting a right lane change into lane 2 without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane. This recognition error led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (the 2006 Hino Flatbed tow truck). The driver of Vehicle #2 (the tow truck) was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as the Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #2 was the encroachment of Vehicle #1 into its lane. Therefore, Vehicle #2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the crash. Vehicle #3 (the 1990 Dodge Dynasty) was not involved in the initial impact between Vehicle #1 and Vehicle #2, and no Critical Pre-crash Event or Critical Reason was coded for Vehicle #3. Therefore, Vehicle #3 is not considered primarily responsible for the crash either.
