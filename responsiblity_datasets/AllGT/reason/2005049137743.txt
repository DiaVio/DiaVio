The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, attempting to make a left turn. This indicates that V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, which is a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted that the traffic signal was yellow when making the turn, suggesting that they attempted to make the turn even though it was not safe to do so. On the other hand, V2 (the 2005 Scion XA sedan) was approaching the intersection in the third lane, indicating that they were traveling in their designated lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the accident.
