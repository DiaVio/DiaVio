The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to pass V2 (the 1976 International Harvester 986 Tractor with a tri-deck mower attached) in a no passing zone, which is an illegal maneuver. Instead of slowing down and waiting for a safe opportunity to pass, V1 decided to pass V2 in the southbound lane. When V1 realized there was an oncoming vehicle, they tried to return to the northbound lane but ended up colliding with the center mower and left support wheel of V2. In summary, V1's decision to illegally pass in a no passing zone and failure to properly assess the situation led to the rear-end crash.
