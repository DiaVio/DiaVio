The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was impaired due to alcohol consumption, as evidenced by the presence of a half-empty gallon of vodka in the trunk. The driver's impairment led to incapacitation and a lack of memory of the crash. This impaired state likely caused the driver to fail to turn at the T-intersection and instead drive straight through the intersection and into the grassy field, ultimately resulting in the collision with the embankment.
