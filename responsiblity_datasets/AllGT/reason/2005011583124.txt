The reason for this is that V1 lost control and spun out in front of the semi-truck. The driver of V1 reported that a truck in lane 2 began to merge into lane 1 and made contact with V1's left quarter panel. However, the investigating officer determined that V1 lost control and spun out, indicating that V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was eating and conversing with other occupants at the time of the crash. While there were no indications of fatigue, emotional or work stress, the fact that the driver was engaged in activities other than focusing on the road may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
