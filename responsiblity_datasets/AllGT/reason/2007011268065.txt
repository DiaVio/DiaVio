The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn at the split in the road without properly checking for oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she was looking to the right at the other vehicle and did not see V2 approaching from the opposite direction. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by the vehicle in front of her that was braking and slowing down. This distraction, combined with the driver's concerns about financial and work-related matters, may have contributed to her failure to look far enough ahead and properly assess the traffic situation. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX) was driving within the posted speed limit and did not exhibit any reckless behavior. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to a recognition error and inadequate surveillance while making a left turn at the intersection.
