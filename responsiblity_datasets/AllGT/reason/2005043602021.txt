The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road before making a left turn. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was "inadequate surveillance." V1's driver stated that she was watching her uncle who was moving a vehicle in her driveway, which was an exterior distraction. This distraction likely contributed to her failure to properly observe the oncoming Vehicle 2 (V2) and accurately judge the distance and speed at which it was approaching. As a result, V1 turned into the path of V2, causing the collision.
