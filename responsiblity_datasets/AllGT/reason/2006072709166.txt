The reason for this is that V1, the taxicab, was traveling downhill on the entrance ramp and failed to maintain a safe distance from Vehicle two (V2), which was stopped at the control light at the bottom of the ramp. V1's front impacted the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was not able to stop in time or maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 had one tire with low tread depth, which could have contributed to reduced traction and braking ability, further supporting V1's responsibility for the accident. Since V2 left the scene and the driver was not interviewed, it is not possible to determine if there were any contributing factors on their part. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1.
