The driver of Vehicle one admitted to changing lanes to the right without seeing the other vehicle (Vehicle two). This indicates a failure to properly check blind spots and exercise caution while changing lanes. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as inattention, suggesting that the driver was not fully focused on the road at the time of the crash. While Vehicle two (2000 Chevrolet Tahoe) was involved in the crash, there is no indication that the driver of Vehicle two was at fault. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that Vehicle one crossed into Vehicle two's lane. In summary, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly check blind spots and exercise caution while changing lanes, as well as the coded critical pre-crash event of inattention.
