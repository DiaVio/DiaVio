The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before crossing. The driver stated that the shrubbery in the median blocked his view, but he still proceeded without ensuring it was safe to do so. This indicates a lack of proper observation and caution on the part of the driver. Additionally, V1's estimated travel and impact speeds were significantly lower than V2's speeds. This suggests that V1 may not have been able to accurately judge the distance and speed of oncoming traffic, further contributing to the driver's failure to avoid the crash. Overall, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to exercise caution at the intersection make them primarily responsible for the accident.
