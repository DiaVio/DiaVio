The reason for this is that the driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the 2005 Freightliner truck) would continue forward, even though V2 had stopped for the red light. This false assumption led to V1 impacting the rear of V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had a myopic eye condition but was not wearing his corrective lenses at the time of the crash. This could have impaired his vision and contributed to his false assumption of V2's actions. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to wear corrective lenses are the primary factors that make V1 responsible for the accident.
