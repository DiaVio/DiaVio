The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which was identified as a driver-related error. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 97 kmph (60 mph), which exceeded the posted speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph). The fact that the driver was inexperienced due to her young age further contributes to her responsibility for the crash. The tire deficiency, with dangerously low tread, was also identified as an associated factor, indicating a lack of proper vehicle maintenance.
