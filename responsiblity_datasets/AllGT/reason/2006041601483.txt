The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was following too closely to the vehicle in front of her and was unable to respond in time to the sudden stop. This decision error led to V1 colliding with the concrete barrier on the left side of the roadway. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as the traffic ahead had come to a stop due to a nearby crash. These factors contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
