The reason for this is that V1 experienced a tire tread separation on the left rear tire, which caused the vehicle to run off the left side of the roadway. This indicates a vehicle-related factor, specifically tire/wheel failure, as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 was arrested for unrelated charges, suggesting a lack of attention or control over the vehicle at the time of the incident.
