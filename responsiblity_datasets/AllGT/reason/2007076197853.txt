The driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, poor directional control and overcompensation were associative factors for the driver. The lack of shoulder on the right side of the roadway due to the embankment was considered a roadway factor, but the driver's actions were the main cause of the accident.
