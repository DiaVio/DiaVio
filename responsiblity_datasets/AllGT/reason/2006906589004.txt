The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 admitted that her shoe/sandal got stuck under the gas pedal, causing her to lose control of the vehicle and collide with Vehicle 1. This is considered a performance error on the part of the driver of Vehicle 2. Additionally, an associated factor coded to the driver of Vehicle 2 is that she failed to stop for the traffic control device (TCD), indicating that she did not properly respond to the red light at the intersection. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's performance error and failure to stop for the traffic control device.
