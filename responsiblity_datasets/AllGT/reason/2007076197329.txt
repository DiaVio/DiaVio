The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was arrested for extreme DUI and had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.264, which is more than three times the legal limit. Additionally, a witness stated that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 112 kmph (70 mph) while negotiating the right curve, which is significantly above the posted speed limit and advisory speed for the curve. The driver's impaired state due to alcohol consumption and excessive speed are clear indications of negligence and disregard for traffic laws and safety. These factors directly contributed to V1's departure from the road, contact with the guardrail, and subsequent impact with the embankment. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's extreme DUI, high speed, and failure to negotiate the curve safely.
