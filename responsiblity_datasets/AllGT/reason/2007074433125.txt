The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and had an obstructed view. The driver stated that he did not see V1 (the Buick LeSabre) prior to the crash. This indicates that V2 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," further supporting the driver's responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." However, this event was not coded to V1, indicating that V1 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to turning left with an obstructed view and failing to see V1 before the collision occurred.
