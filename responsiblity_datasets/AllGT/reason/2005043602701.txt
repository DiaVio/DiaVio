The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling too fast for the curve, which caused them to depart the left side of the road and enter the grass median. This ultimately led to V1 becoming airborne, striking a tree, and then being struck by V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Lumina) in the southbound lanes. V2, on the other hand, reacted appropriately by steering to the right and braking hard when she saw V1 rolling towards her. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
