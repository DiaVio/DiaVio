The reason for V1's responsibility is that the vehicle traveled off the right side of the roadway, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle within the designated lane. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation after returning to the roadway led to the counterclockwise rotation and subsequent rollover of V1. The exact cause of why V1 initially departed the roadway to the right is unknown, but it is clear that the driver's actions and inability to regain control of the vehicle ultimately resulted in the accident.
