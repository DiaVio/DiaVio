The reason for this is that V2 was traveling downhill on a 1% grade just after a hillcrest, while V1, the 2009 BMW 528i sedan, was crossing through the intersection on a 5% uphill grade before leveling out at a hillcrest. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and should have yielded to V1. The left side impact occurred when V1 began crossing the intersection and was impacted by the front of V2. The subsequent rotation of both vehicles and the sideslap pattern further indicate that V2 was primarily responsible for the collision.
