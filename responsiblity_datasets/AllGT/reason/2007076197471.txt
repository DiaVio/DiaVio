The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were driving too fast for the conditions. The speed limit was 89 kmph (55 mph), but there was an advisory speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) for the curve and downhill elevation. Additionally, the roadway was wet due to rain. Despite these conditions, V1 failed to adjust their speed accordingly and was unable to safely negotiate the curve. As a result, they collided with the guardrail on the left side of the roadway and their trailer contacted the back end of V2, pushing it into the dirt embankment on the right side of the road. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in the #1 lane due to a prior crash and was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the crash.
