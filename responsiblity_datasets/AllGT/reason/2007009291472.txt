The reason for this is that V2, the 2007 Ford Edge SUV, made a sudden maneuver by braking hard and steering right to avoid a collision with a blue Mitsubishi Eclipse that had stopped in the left turn lane. However, in doing so, V2 veered into lane two, where V1, the 1997 Ford F-Series Super Duty truck, was traveling. V1 was unable to avoid the collision and crashed into the back right side of V2. Therefore, V2's sudden maneuver and encroachment into lane two caused the crash.
