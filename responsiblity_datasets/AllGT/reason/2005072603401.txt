The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver panicked and overcorrected while attempting to change lanes. This resulted in poor directional control of the vehicle, causing it to fishtail and ultimately collide with V2 (the 2005 Honda Civic). V1's decision to change lanes without properly assessing the situation and reacting in a controlled manner led to the loss of control and subsequent accident.
