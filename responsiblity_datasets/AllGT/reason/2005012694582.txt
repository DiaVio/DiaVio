The reason for this is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 118 kmph (70 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph) and considered too fast for the wet road conditions. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the vehicle felt "funny" from the start of the trip, indicating a potential mechanical issue or unfamiliarity with the vehicle. These factors, combined with the driver's lack of experience with the vehicle and poor directional control, led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the wall.
