The reason for this is that V2 failed to negotiate a complete right-hand turn and crossed over the cement median strip, entering into the eastbound travel lane just west of the intersection. This action resulted in a collision with Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe, which was traveling in the right center eastbound travel lane.
