The case vehicle (V1) changed lanes to the right and struck the left side of POV 1 (V2), causing an initial impact. Then, the case vehicle veered to the left and its right rear struck the left side of POV 1 (V2) in a side slap impact. This sequence of events indicates that the case vehicle initiated the collision. Additionally, after the initial impacts, POV 2 (V3) struck the case vehicle in a glancing sideswipe type impact. However, this secondary impact occurred after the case vehicle had already been involved in the collision with POV 1 (V2). Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the actions of the vehicles involved, the case vehicle (V1) is primarily responsible for the crash.
