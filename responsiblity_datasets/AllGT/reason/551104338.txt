The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it failed to yield the right of way at the intersection. V1 crossed the eastbound lanes and stopped in the median, but failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic in the westbound lanes before continuing to cross. This resulted in the collision with Vehicle Two (V2), which was traveling westbound and had the right of way.
