The reason for this is that V1 experienced a tire tread separation, which caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The driver's attempts to brake and steer actually worsened the situation, leading to V1 colliding with the guardrail, rolling over, and ultimately coming to rest on its roof. While the driver claims that the tire blew out and she was unable to react or gain control of the vehicle, it is important to note that the responsibility for maintaining the vehicle's tires lies with the owner. The driver mentioned that she could not remember the last time her tires were serviced, indicating a lack of proper maintenance. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the tire failure/deficiency and the driver's incorrect evasive actions.
