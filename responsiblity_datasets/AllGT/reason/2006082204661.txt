The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2000 Subaru Outback station wagon) who was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1's view of V2 was obstructed by an intervening vehicle, but V1 made a false assumption that it was safe to make the turn without realizing that V2 was behind the truck. This decision error by V1 led to the collision.
