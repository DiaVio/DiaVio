The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the roadway to the right and struck a utility pole. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene on foot, indicating a potential attempt to avoid responsibility or legal consequences. Since the critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as "type of driver error unknown," it further suggests that V1's actions were the main contributing factor to the accident.
