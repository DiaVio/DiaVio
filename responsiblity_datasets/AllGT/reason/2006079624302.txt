The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of approximately 112 kph (70 mph) on a curve with an advisory speed limit of 40 kph (25 mph). This indicates that the driver was going too fast for the curve, which led to V1 departing the left edge of the off-ramp and ultimately causing the collision. Additionally, the driver was not wearing her eyeglasses at the time of the collision, which may have impaired her vision and contributed to the incident.
