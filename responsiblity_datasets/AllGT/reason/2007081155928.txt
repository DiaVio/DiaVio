The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn in front of oncoming traffic, which is a risky maneuver. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 (the driver of the Land Rover Discovery) approaching. This lack of surveillance and failure to detect the oncoming vehicle led to the collision. Additionally, V1 proceeded through the intersection when the traffic light turned yellow, indicating that there may not have been enough time to safely complete the turn before oncoming traffic arrived. Overall, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic were the critical factors that led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
