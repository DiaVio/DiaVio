The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the roadway. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and critical reason codes provided, which indicate that the loss of vehicle control was due to traveling too fast for the curve/turn. Additionally, the driver's alcohol breath test result of .240 indicates that they were impaired, which likely contributed to their poor directional control and inability to navigate the curve safely.
