The driver of V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn. Despite stopping and checking left for traffic, the driver failed to look left again to note the position of V2 approaching prior to entering the roadway. This misjudgment of the gap or V2's speed led to the collision. V2 (the driver of the Mazda pickup) also bears some responsibility for falsely assuming that V1 would yield the right of way. However, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
