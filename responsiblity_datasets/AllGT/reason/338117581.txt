The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that it failed to stop in time and collided with the rear of vehicle V2, the 1999 Sterling 3-axle straight truck, which was already stopped and waiting for traffic to proceed. V1 underrode the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was traveling at a higher speed or failed to brake adequately to avoid the collision.
