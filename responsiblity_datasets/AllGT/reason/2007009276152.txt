The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a black out due to a diabetic problem, which impaired his ability to act and caused him to lose control of the vehicle. This is supported by the fact that V1 traveled out of its lane, struck a light post, crossed over multiple lanes of traffic, and ultimately collided with V2. The driver's pre-existing medical condition and the use of insulin to treat it are associated factors that contributed to the driver's black out.
