The reason for this is that V1 was crossing through the intersection and impacted V2 on its right plane with V1's front plane. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor: misjudgment of gap or other's speed. This indicates that V1 failed to accurately assess the distance and speed of V2, leading to the collision. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from crossing the street across the path. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their misjudgment of the gap or other's speed.
