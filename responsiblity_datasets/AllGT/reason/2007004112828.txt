The reason for this is that V1 misjudged the speed of V2 and proceeded to accelerate, thinking she had enough time to safely cross the roadway. However, she did not have enough time and was struck by V2. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 and made an unsafe maneuver, resulting in the collision.
