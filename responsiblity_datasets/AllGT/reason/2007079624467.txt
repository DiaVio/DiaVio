The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and was unable to control the vehicle while negotiating the left curve. The driver's poor directional control and overcompensation led to V1 crossing all lanes and ultimately colliding with the south curb, street sign, and light pole. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the travel lanes indicates their responsibility for the accident.
