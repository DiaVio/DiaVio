The reason for this is that the driver took his eyes off the road to look for his ringing cell phone, which caused the vehicle to veer off onto the soft dirt shoulder. Although the road conditions were described as having narrow shoulders comprised of soft dirt adjacent to a non-transversable slope, the critical pre-crash event was coded as vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions. This is because the driver had already departed the roadway and was attempting to return to it when the vehicle subsequently rolled over down the embankment. Therefore, the driver's distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the primary factors that led to the accident.
