The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to assuming that V2 (the driver of the 1997 Dodge Neon) would continue through the yellow light. This false assumption of V2's actions led to V1 not maintaining a safe following distance and subsequently colliding with the rear of V2. Additionally, V1 stated that she always drives in a hurry and was in a rush to get to a fast food restaurant during her lunch break. This indicates a disregard for traffic laws and a lack of attention to the road, contributing to the collision. Furthermore, V1 had four teenagers in the vehicle with her, which may have caused distractions and impaired her ability to focus on the road. Overall, V1's false assumption of V2's actions, combined with her reckless driving behavior and potential distractions, make her primarily responsible for the rear-end collision.
