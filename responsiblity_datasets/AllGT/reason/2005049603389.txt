The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to cross the eastbound lanes of traffic from the third lane of the northbound roadway, in order to reach a business parking lot located north of the westbound lanes. V2 (the driver of the 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was traveling east in the second lane and recognized V1 crossing its lane of travel. V2 tried to avoid the collision by steering to the left, but V1 entered the second lane of the westbound traffic lanes, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the right side of V2. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed while attempting to cross the eastbound lanes of traffic is the primary reason for the crash.
