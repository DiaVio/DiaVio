The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the critical reason for this event was inadequate surveillance. The driver of V2 failed to properly look or see the lane change, which resulted in the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as she had only been driving for twelve months, was an associated factor.
