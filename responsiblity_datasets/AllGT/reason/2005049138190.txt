The driver of V1 admitted to running a red light, indicating that they entered the intersection without the right of way. This action directly led to the collision with V2 (2002 Toyota Echo) and subsequent collisions with V3 (2003 Infinity G-35). The driver of V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and recognize the traffic light signal resulted in the accident.
