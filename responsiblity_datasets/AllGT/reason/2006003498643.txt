The driver of Vehicle # 1 attempted to go straight from the left turning lane, which is marked for left turns only. This illegal maneuver violated traffic rules and contributed to the collision with Vehicle # 2. Vehicle # 2 (the Scion XB) was traveling in the correct lane and did not encroach into the lane of Vehicle # 1. Therefore, Vehicle # 2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
