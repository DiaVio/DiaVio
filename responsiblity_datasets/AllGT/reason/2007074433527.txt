The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that she looked left and right before entering the intersection but did not see V2. However, it is the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to ensure that the intersection is clear before proceeding. In this case, V1 failed to do so, resulting in the collision with V2. While V2 was reportedly speeding and talking on a cell phone, these factors are considered associated factors and not the primary cause of the accident. The primary cause lies with V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
