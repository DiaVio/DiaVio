The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it lost control on the wet pavement, crossed the eastbound travel lane, and departed the south edge of the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle under the prevailing road and weather conditions, leading to the rollover collision.
