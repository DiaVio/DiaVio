The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was engaged in internal distraction, specifically looking at the interior controls while driving. This distraction likely caused the driver to cross over into the northbound lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one admitted to speeding and was test-driving the car for the first time, indicating a lack of familiarity with the vehicle and the roadway. The underinflated tires may have also contributed to the driver's loss of control. While the driver of Vehicle two was traveling in the opposite direction, their critical pre-crash event was simply being in the lane, which suggests they were not at fault for the collision. In summary, the driver of Vehicle one's internal distraction, lack of experience with the vehicle, speeding, and underinflated tires make them primarily responsible for the crash.
