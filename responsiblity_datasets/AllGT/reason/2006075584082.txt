The reason for Vehicle one's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of Vehicle one failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn. Despite the driver's claim of the cloudy day and the vehicle blending into the green scenery, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure it is safe to proceed with the turn. The driver's failure to see Vehicle two (1994 Subaru Impreza) approaching from the westbound lane resulted in the collision.
