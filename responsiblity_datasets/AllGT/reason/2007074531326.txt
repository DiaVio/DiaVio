The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Chevrolet Malibu). V1 stated that he looked to the left and assumed that V2 had a right turn signal on, leading him to believe that V2 was turning right at the intersection. However, V2's right turn signal was not on, indicating that V1's assumption was incorrect. V1's false assumption of V2's actions led him to enter the intersection without ensuring that it was clear, resulting in the collision with V2. This driver-related factor of false assumption of other's actions is the critical reason for the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
