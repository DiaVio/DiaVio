The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at a red light, as witnessed by two on-scene witnesses. Additionally, V1 was cited for failure to stop at a traffic control device and was driving without proof of insurance. The driver's statement that he was unable to stop in time due to the cargo and heaviness of the truck indicates a lack of proper control and awareness while approaching the intersection.
