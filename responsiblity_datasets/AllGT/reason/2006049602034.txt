The driver of V1 ran a red light, which was coded as an illegal maneuver. This is supported by the fact that the driver of V1 stated she saw a white passenger car stopped in lane 1 of the southbound lanes, indicating that her light must have been red if she was coming from the northbound highway exit road and turning left to drive under the underpass. V2 (the 2005 Ford F-450 tow truck) was traveling in the second lane of the southbound lanes and had a green light, according to the driver. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as another vehicle encroaching into the lane, indicating that V1 crossed into the path of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for running a red light and causing the collision.
