The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted into the westbound travel lane, causing a head-on collision with Vehicle 1. The case summary states that there was an attempt at an evasive maneuver by one or both vehicles, suggesting that Vehicle 1 may have tried to avoid the collision. However, the collision still occurred due to the drift of Vehicle 2 into the wrong lane.
