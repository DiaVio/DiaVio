The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. This indicates that the driver was not paying attention to the road and surroundings, leading to the vehicle traveling off the left side of the roadway and subsequently rolling over. Additionally, the driver's statement of looking out of her left window into the desert suggests a lack of focus on the task of driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
