The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn into the parking garage and turned with an obstructed view. The driver of V1 reported that traffic in the second and third eastbound lanes stopped to allow her to proceed, but she could not see traffic in the first eastbound lane. This indicates that she did not have a clear view of oncoming traffic before making the turn. V2 (the driver of the 2000 Toyota Camry) reported that he saw V1 as it entered his lane and applied the brakes, but was unable to stop in time. This suggests that V2 was already in the correct lane and taking appropriate action to avoid a collision. Therefore, V1's decision to turn with an obstructed view and without ensuring it was safe to do so makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
