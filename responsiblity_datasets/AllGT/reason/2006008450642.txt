The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed, reported to be around 96-113kmph (60-70mph), on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 56kmph (35mph). Additionally, the driver of V1 was not wearing his prescription lenses that correct a myopic condition, which could have impaired his vision. The driver also admitted to going too fast and being unable to make the bend in the road. Furthermore, there were indications of alcohol impairment, with a strong smell of alcohol coming from the driver and vehicle, and the driver was later charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. These factors, including excessive speed, impaired vision, and alcohol impairment, all contributed to the driver's decision error of going too fast for the curve, resulting in the crash.
