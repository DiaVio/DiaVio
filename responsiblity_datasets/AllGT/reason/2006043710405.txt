The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 ran a red light, which is a violation of traffic laws. This is indicated by the driver's statement that he guesses he ran the red light and his lack of recollection of the crash events. Additionally, the critical precrash event for V2 was other motor vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 crossed over the left lane line of the opposite direction. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the red light and encroachment into the opposite lane make them primarily responsible for the accident.
