The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed (105 kmph) compared to V2 (40 kmph) and failed to maintain a safe distance between the vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by the request of the second row occupant to retrieve a dropped cup, which caused her to turn her attention away from the road. As a result, V1 collided with the back of V2, causing both vehicles to sustain damage and come to a rest in different locations. Therefore, V1's higher speed, failure to maintain a safe distance, and internal distraction are the primary factors contributing to the accident.
