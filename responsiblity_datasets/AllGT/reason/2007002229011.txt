The reason for this is that V1 admitted to not seeing V2 prior to the crash and made an improper left turn by entering the first northbound lane without ensuring it was clear. The driver of V1 should have exercised proper surveillance and waited until it was safe to enter the lane. If V1 had turned into the second northbound lane, the crash would not have occurred. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Cutlass) stated that V1 was partly in her lane during the turn, but this does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2 also admitted to not seeing V1 prior to impact and panicking, which may have contributed to the subsequent collision with a utility pole. Overall, V1's failure to properly surveil the roadway and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
