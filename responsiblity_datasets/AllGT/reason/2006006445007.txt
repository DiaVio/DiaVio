The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in lane 3 and failed to recognize the deceleration of traffic ahead. V1 attempted to avoid striking V2 by braking and steering to the right, but was unsuccessful and rear-ended V2. This initial impact caused V2 to veer to the left and scrape along the traffic barrier before being struck again by V1 on the right passenger side. Additionally, V1 fled the scene after the collisions, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions.
