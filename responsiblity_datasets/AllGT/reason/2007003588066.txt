The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver reported that the accelerator pedal got stuck, causing him to lose control of the vehicle and ultimately collide with the light pole. The critical pre-crash event and critical reason for the crash were both attributed to a vehicle-related factor, specifically a stuck accelerator pedal. Additionally, an associated factor coded to the driver was an inadequate/incorrect evasion, indicating that the driver did not take sufficient steering and braking actions to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to control the vehicle and the vehicle-related factor of a stuck accelerator pedal.
