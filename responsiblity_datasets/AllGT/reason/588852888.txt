The reason for this is that the case occupant was the driver of V1 and was involved in a severe frontal impact with a non-breakaway traffic light support pole. The injuries sustained by the case occupant, including head trauma, chest injuries, fractures, and contusions, were a result of the impact with the steering wheel, frontal airbags, and intruded interior components of V1.
