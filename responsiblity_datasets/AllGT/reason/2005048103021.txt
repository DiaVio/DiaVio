The reason for this is inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. The driver of V1 failed to adequately look or failed to see the oncoming V2 (the 1998 Western Star tractor pulling one empty semi-trailer) before entering the intersection. This lack of surveillance resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
