The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve on a wet roadway. This resulted in the vehicle sliding to the left, eventually vaulting off the roadside and landing on the embankment. The impact caused the frontal impact airbags to deploy, indicating a significant force of the crash. The subsequent counterclockwise rotation and landing in the V-shaped depression further suggest a loss of control and failure to maintain the vehicle on the roadway.
