The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a wet and slushy roadway after a heavy snowfall. The driver's inexperience with winter driving conditions and overcompensation while trying to regain control of the vehicle contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted to being unfamiliar with driving in snow and ice, which further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
