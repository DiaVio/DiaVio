The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline and depart from the pavement edge onto the left shoulder. This resulted in the vehicle entering a wooded area and colliding with a large diameter tree. The offset damage pattern indicates that the engagement with the tree continued rearward down the vehicle's left side surface, causing severe damage. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver was not awake at the time of the crash, and evidence suggests that the driver was not wearing a seat belt properly. The absence of loading marks on the available driver three-point manual lap and shoulder belt system, along with the improper routing of the shoulder webbing behind the driver seat back, indicates that the driver was not properly restrained. The deployment of the vehicle's airbags and the presence of scuff marks and deformations on various components suggest that the driver experienced a forward trajectory and impact with the vehicle's interior. Blood trails and pooling indicate that the driver came to a final rest position slumped into the right floor pan area. Therefore, based on the driver's actions of crossing the centerline, departing from the road, and the lack of proper seat belt use, Vehicle 1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
