The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions in the congested traffic. The driver of V1 stated that he was looking for his exit and did not see V2's brake lights. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating," further suggesting that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and react appropriately to the slowing traffic ahead. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and respond to the decelerating vehicles ahead makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
