The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down behind V2 (the Nissan Pathfinder) and collided with the rear of V2. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by talking to his passenger and occasionally glancing down at his manifest while driving. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only been driving this type of vehicle for a year and may have been inexperienced in handling large vehicles. V2, on the other hand, was decelerating due to traffic slowing in front of him, which suggests that V2 was responding appropriately to the congested highway conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance, being distracted, and potentially being inexperienced in driving a large vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
