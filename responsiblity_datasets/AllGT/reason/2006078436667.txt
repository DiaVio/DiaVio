The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the speed of V2 (the 1990 Honda) just prior to making a left turn. V1 was decelerating in the left turn lane to make a left turn, but failed to accurately assess the speed of V2 approaching from the opposite direction. This misjudgment led to V1 making the left turn in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 did not make any evasive efforts to avoid the collision, indicating a lack of awareness or reaction to the approaching vehicle. V1's claim that V2 was traveling too fast further suggests a failure to accurately assess the situation and adjust their actions accordingly. Overall, V1's misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2, as well as the lack of evasive efforts, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
