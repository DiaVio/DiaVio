The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver stated he steered right to avoid a non-contact vehicle encroaching into his lane from the left. This indicates that the driver made an incorrect evasive action, which was the critical reason for the crash. The driver's decision to steer right instead of taking appropriate measures to avoid the potential collision led to V1 departing the road, impacting with a curb, going up the embankment, and ultimately colliding with the concrete wall. While the driver's use of medication (Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Flomax) may have potential side effects such as anxiety, nervousness, and drowsiness, it is important to note that the case summary does not provide any evidence or indication that these medications directly contributed to the driver's incorrect evasive action. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 and its driver's decision-making.
