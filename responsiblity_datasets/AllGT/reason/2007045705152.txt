The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was fatigued and inattentive, as indicated by her work and driving schedule, and her failure to notice the traffic slow-down/congestion until she was on top of it. Additionally, V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions (congested traffic) and failed to maintain adequate surveillance by not looking far enough ahead. The driver's claim of sun glare as a factor does not absolve her of responsibility, as it was still her responsibility to adjust her driving accordingly. V2 (the 1999 Nissan Maxima) is not primarily responsible for the crash, as the critical precrash event for V2 was the encroachment of V1 over the left lane line. No other contributing factors were coded to V2, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash.
