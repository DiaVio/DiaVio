The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The witness stated that V1 hit an icy patch on the road, causing the vehicle to skid and lose control. This indicates that the driver was not adjusting their speed to match the wet and icy road conditions. Additionally, the witness mentioned that if V1 hadn't come to rest in the opposite lane, their vehicles would have collided, suggesting that V1's loss of control was a contributing factor to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed for the slick road conditions.
