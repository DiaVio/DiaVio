The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling above the posted speed limit for the roadway, which ultimately led to the control loss and the vehicle running off the right side of the roadway. The driver's decision error of driving too fast for the curve, along with aggressive driving and overcompensation, contributed to the crash.
