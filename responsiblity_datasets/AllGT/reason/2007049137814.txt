The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of safe driving practices. The driver's drowsiness and lack of sleep, combined with the fact that he had been driving for a long period of time, likely contributed to his inability to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in it veering off the road and colliding with the light poles.
