The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not adequately survey the intersection before crossing it. Additionally, the driver was inattentive due to thinking about a future event and had a sightline restriction created by the presence of a large construction dumpster. These factors contributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance and ultimately led to the collision with V2.
