The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 overcompensated while trying to regain control of the vehicle after traveling off the road to the right. This overcompensation led to V1 rotating clockwise and ultimately rolling over to the left side of the road. The driver's poor directional control, combined with the slushy condition of the roadway, were contributing factors to the crash.
