The reason for this is that V1 initiated the lane change without properly checking for other vehicles and made contact with V2. V1's action of changing lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so led to the collision and subsequent loss of control by V2. Additionally, V1 left the scene of the crash, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions.
