The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn out of the private driveway, crossing the path of V2 (the driver of the 2007 Toyota Yaris) who was traveling straight in the westbound lane. V1's left turn was made without yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1 made a "false assumption of other's actions" suggests a lack of attentiveness or awareness on the part of the driver. The presence of multiple medications taken by V1, including Atenolol, Xanax, Captopril, Welbutrin, and Lovestatin, may have also contributed to impaired judgment or reaction time. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and potential impairment from medication usage make them primarily responsible for the collision.
