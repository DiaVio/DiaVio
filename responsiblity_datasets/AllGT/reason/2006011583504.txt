The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the roadway before turning left. She admitted to being distracted by her cell phone ringing and reaching for it, which caused her to not realize that she had entered the roadway. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. While V2 (the 81-year-old male driver of the Jeep Liberty) did attempt to brake to avoid the collision, he was unable to do so due to V1's sudden entry onto the roadway. V2's age and physical condition may have been contributing factors, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly checking for oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
