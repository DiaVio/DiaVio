The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by her cell phone ringing and took her eyes off the forward traffic for too long. As a result, she failed to notice that traffic ahead of her was at a complete stop and collided with the rear of V2 (the 1999 K1500 Suburban), which then caused a chain reaction involving V3 (the 1990 Subaru Legacy) and V4 (the 2004 GMC Yukon). Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued from running a 5K marathon four days prior to the collision, which may have further impaired her ability to react to the situation. The fact that she was consuming an alcoholic beverage as an energy drink and had an open container in the vehicle also raises concerns about her level of attentiveness and responsibility while driving.
