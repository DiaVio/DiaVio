The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to notice the vehicles slowing down ahead and did not apply the brakes in time to avoid a collision. This resulted in V1 colliding with the rear of V2 (the 2007 Dodge Express cargo van), which then pushed V2 into the rear of V3 (the 2009 GMC Acadia). The fact that V1 was the vehicle that initiated the chain reaction of collisions indicates that it bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
