The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking to his left at a dog kennel and trying to read the phone number. This external distraction caused him to not notice the stopped vehicles in front of him until it was too late. Despite activating the ABS and attempting to brake, he was unable to stop in time and collided with V2 (the 2004 Ford Ranger), which was then pushed into V3 (the 1984 Porsche 911). Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road ahead are the main reasons for the crash.
