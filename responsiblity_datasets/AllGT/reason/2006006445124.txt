The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was internally distracted while driving. He was attempting to buckle his seat belt and was looking down to find the buckle, taking his attention away from the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being tired, which likely contributed to his lack of awareness of the bus stop and the fact that the bus had stopped to pick up passengers. V2 (the driver of the 2002 New Flyer bus) does not bear primary responsibility for the accident as there is no evidence to suggest any fault on their part. The bus was stopped for a short period of time to pick up passengers, and there were no associated factors coded to the driver of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to internal distraction and a false assumption about the actions of V2.
