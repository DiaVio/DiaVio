The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver of V1 stated that he looked left and right but did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surroundings, which resulted in V1 entering the intersection when it was not clear to do so. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2001 Honda Civic) saw V1 stopped at the intersection and took appropriate action by applying the brakes and steering to the right. This suggests that V2 was attentive and reacted in a reasonable manner to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and ensure it was clear before entering makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
