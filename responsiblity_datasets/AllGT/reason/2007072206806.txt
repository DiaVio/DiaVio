The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly observe the intersection before proceeding, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, the associated factor of V1's speed also contributed to the crash. Although the specific speed of V1 is not reported, it is mentioned that the driver tried to stop when realizing the signal was turning red but did not have enough time. This suggests that V1 may have been traveling at a speed that made it difficult to stop in time, further exacerbating the collision. Therefore, based on the inadequate surveillance and associated speed factor, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
