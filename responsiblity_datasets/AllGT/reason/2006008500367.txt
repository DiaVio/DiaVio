The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive to the driving task due to personal circumstances, which likely contributed to her failure to notice V2 (the 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck) approaching the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to apply her brakes and steer to the right to avoid the collision, indicating that she was aware of the situation but unable to prevent the crash. On the other hand, V2 stopped for its stop sign and proceeded into the intersection assuming that V1 would stop as required. While this assumption was incorrect, it does not absolve V1 of responsibility for failing to obey the stop sign. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her failure to stop for the stop sign and her inattentiveness to the driving task.
