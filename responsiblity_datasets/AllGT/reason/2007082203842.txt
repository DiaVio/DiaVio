The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to change lanes without fully establishing lane two as its travel lane. As a result, V1 impacted the rear of V2 (the Ford E350 Cargo Van) while it was stopped behind a vehicle yielding the right of way to turn left onto a side street. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and misjudged the gap or speed of V2, leading to the collision.
