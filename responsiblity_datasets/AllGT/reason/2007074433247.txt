The reason for this is that V1 failed to realize that the vehicles ahead were stopped until the last minute, indicating a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the other vehicles. Additionally, V1's BAC (blood alcohol concentration) was reported to be .202, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This suggests that the driver of V1 was impaired and likely contributed to the misjudgment and inability to react in a timely manner. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and react appropriately to the stopped vehicles ahead, combined with the driver's impaired state, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
