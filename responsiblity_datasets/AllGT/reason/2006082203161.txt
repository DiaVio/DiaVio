The reason for this is that V1 drifted out of the travel lane and struck both V2 and V3, causing damage to both vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported that she "blacked out" possibly due to prescription medications she had been taking, indicating a driver-related factor. The fact that V1 driver was taking medications for high blood pressure, bipolar disorder, and depression, along with a recent increase in one of the medications, may have contributed to her falling asleep at the wheel.
