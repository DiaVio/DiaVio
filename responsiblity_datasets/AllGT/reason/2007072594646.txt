The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe the intersection before crossing it. This suggests that V1 did not exercise the necessary caution and failed to look or see the oncoming vehicle (V2) before entering the intersection. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. The driver of V2 stated that he saw V1 just prior to the crash and attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly observe the intersection before crossing it.
