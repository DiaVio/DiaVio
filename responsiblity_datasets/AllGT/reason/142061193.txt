The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was traveling in the left travel lane and for some unknown reason, the driver lost control and traveled off the north road-edge, ultimately impacting the metal guardrail multiple times before coming to a rest on the roadway. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lane indicates that Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
