The reason for this is that V2 failed to recognize the speed change of Vehicle three (V3) and collided with its rear, causing V3 to drive into the median. V2 then continued and struck the rear of Vehicle one (V1), which resulted in V1 rolling over and coming to rest in the median. Finally, V2 continued further and struck the rear of Vehicle four (V4). Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe distance and react to the changing traffic conditions led to a chain reaction of collisions, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
