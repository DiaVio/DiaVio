The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a tire blowout. The driver stated that he felt the right front tire blow out, causing the vehicle to pull to the right. Despite attempting to steer back onto the road, the driver was unable to avoid the utility pole. The inspection of the tire revealed that it had only 1/32" of tread and had been worn unevenly, indicating that it was in poor condition. This tire failure was the critical reason for the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
