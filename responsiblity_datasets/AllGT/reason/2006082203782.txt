The reason for this is as follows: - The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the left curve, indicating a failure to properly handle the curve. - Witnesses reported that the driver was speeding and weaving in traffic before the crash, suggesting reckless driving behavior. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," indicating that the driver was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the wet road conditions and the curve. - The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for curve/turn," further emphasizing the driver's responsibility for the crash. - Additionally, the worn tread on the left front and right rear tires, which were associated factors, may have contributed to the loss of control, but the primary responsibility still lies with the driver for driving too fast for the conditions. Therefore, V1 (the driver of the 1993 Toyota Corolla) is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to control the vehicle while traveling too fast for the curve and the wet road conditions.
