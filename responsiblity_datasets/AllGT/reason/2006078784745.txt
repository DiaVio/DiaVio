The driver of V-1 failed to adequately surveil the area behind him before initiating his left turn. This lack of surveillance resulted in V-1 pulling out in front of V-2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Silhouette Minivan), who was about to pass. Therefore, V-1's failure to properly check for oncoming traffic and yield the right of way to V-2 led to the collision.
