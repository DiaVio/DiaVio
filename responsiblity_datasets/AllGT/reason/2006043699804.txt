The reason for this is that V2 was stopped in lane one, which was under construction, and then began accelerating and moving into lane two, where V1 (the Toyota Corolla) was traveling. V2 encroached into V1's lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V2 was "poor directional control," indicating that the driver lost track of where his vehicle was located on the roadway. Therefore, V2's actions of encroaching into the oncoming lane and poor directional control make them primarily responsible for the accident.
