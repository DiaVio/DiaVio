The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 experienced a loss of control due to the icy roadway surface condition and departed its travel lane, entering the northbound travel lane where Vehicle 1 was traveling. Vehicle 1 attempted to brake and steer to avoid the collision, but the offset frontal impact occurred. Therefore, the loss of control by Vehicle 2 and its entry into the wrong lane caused the accident.
