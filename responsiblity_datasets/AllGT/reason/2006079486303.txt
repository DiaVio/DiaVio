The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle, veered off the road, and struck the curb. This poor directional control ultimately led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the fact that V1 veered off the road and impacted the curb indicates a lack of proper attention and control by the driver. V2 (the driver of the 1993 Toyota T-100 pick up) may have contributed to the collision by not having a valid license and potentially not being familiar with the roadway. However, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other - vehicle not involved in first harmful event," indicating that V2's actions were not directly responsible for the collision. Overall, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and veering off the road is the primary reason for the collision, making V1 primarily responsible.
