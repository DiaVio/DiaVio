The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the other vehicle's actions. The driver of V1 thought that V2 had to yield to their vehicle while making a left turn at the intersection. However, V2 was simply traveling straight through the intersection and did not have an obligation to yield. This false assumption led to V1 initiating the left turn without giving V2 enough time or space to pass through the intersection, resulting in the collision.
