The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to pay attention to the traffic controls and the changing traffic signal. The driver admitted to not realizing that the light had turned red until just prior to the crash. This indicates a lack of awareness and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. While V2 (the driver of the 2000 Chrysler Cirrus) was involved in the critical pre-crash event of crossing the street across the path of V1, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. Therefore, V2's responsibility is considered secondary in this case. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to pay attention to the traffic controls and the changing traffic signal.
