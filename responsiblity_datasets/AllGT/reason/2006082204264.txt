The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the adjacent lane before changing lanes. This is evident from the driver's statement that she didn't look before changing lanes. As a result, V1 cut across lane 2 and entered lane 1, causing the collision with the front left corner of Vehicle 2 (V2).
