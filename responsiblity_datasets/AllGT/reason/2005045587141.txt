The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control and began to fishtail on the wet pavement. The driver's attempt to steer to the right and subsequent overcorrection to the left resulted in the vehicle rotating counterclockwise and ultimately colliding with the center barrier wall. The driver's claim of a phantom vehicle (a tractor-trailer in the left lane) forcing him to slow and steer right does not have any supporting evidence, as he was unable to provide any description of the truck. Therefore, based on the available information, the driver of Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to poor directional control and traveling too fast for the conditions.
