The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was slowing down and almost completely stopped in the right northbound lane while attempting to turn right into a private lot. This indicates that Vehicle #2 was not following the flow of traffic and was not maintaining a consistent speed. Vehicle #1, on the other hand, was traveling at a rapid rate and was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision. Additionally, Vehicle #2's underride guard was bent to an almost horizontal position, suggesting that Vehicle #2 was not properly equipped or positioned to ensure the safety of other vehicles on the road. Therefore, Vehicle #2's actions of slowing down and attempting to turn without proper caution make it primarily responsible for the crash.
