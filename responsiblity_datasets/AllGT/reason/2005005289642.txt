Reason: V1 attempted to pass V2 illegally by crossing the double yellow lines, which is a violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver led to the collision between the right side of V1 and the left front of V2. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a high speed of 80 kmph (50 mph) in a 48 kmph (30 mph) zone, which indicates excess speed and aggressive driving. The driver of V1 also falsely assumed that V2 would stay in her lane, further contributing to the accident.
