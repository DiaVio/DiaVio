The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by a group of young men walking along the sidewalk, specifically one of them letting his pants slide down his legs. This distraction caused V1 to not notice the vehicle ahead and the lack of brake lights due to the bright sunlight. As a result, V1 collided with the rear of V2 (the 1997 Ford Expedition), which then pushed V2 into the rear of V3 (the 2000 Chrysler Sebring). Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to react to the traffic ahead is the primary cause of the accident.
