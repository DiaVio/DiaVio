The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before entering the roadway, which is considered a driver-related error. This lack of attention and failure to look again to the left before pulling out resulted in the collision with V2 (the 1997 Ford Taurus). The driver of V1 admitted to being upset and distracted after visiting a family member at the nursing home, which likely contributed to the inadequate surveillance and driver inattention.
