The reason for this is that V1 was exiting a commercial drive and crossing three lanes of traffic to make a left turn. V2 (the 1998 Ford F-150 pickup truck) was traveling straight in its designated lane. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and crossing the path of oncoming traffic.
