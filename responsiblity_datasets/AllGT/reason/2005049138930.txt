The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass the traffic ahead by departing the travel lanes to the right, which resulted in striking a retaining wall and losing control. This action of attempting to pass in an unsafe manner and subsequently losing control led to the collision with V2 (the 1999 Ford Explorer driven by the 28-year-old male). Therefore, V1's decision to pass in an unsafe manner and subsequent loss of control is the primary reason for the crash.
