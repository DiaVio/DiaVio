The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2) proceeding straight through the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right-of-way to V2 resulted in the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
