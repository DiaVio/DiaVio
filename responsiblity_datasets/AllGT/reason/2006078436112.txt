The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the forward traffic. The driver turned his head to the right to look at traffic in the adjacent lane, which caused him to miss the fact that V2 had stopped in front of his vehicle. Although V1 attempted to brake and avoid the collision, the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in time led to the impact. V2, on the other hand, was following the normal traffic flow and had stopped behind the non-contact vehicle turning left. V2 observed V1 approaching in the rearview mirror and braced for the impact. Due to the congested traffic on either side, V2 was unable to move the vehicle to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front.
