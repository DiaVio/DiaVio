The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 drifted across the broken yellow center line into the southbound lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane control. This action led to the sideswiping of a utility pole and subsequently striking another utility pole, resulting in disabling damage to V1. The driver's failure to stay within their designated lane and control the vehicle's movement ultimately caused the accident.
