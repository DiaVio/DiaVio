The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 129 kmph (88 mph), which is significantly above the speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). Additionally, the driver of V1 was taking medication for hypertension and post-traumatic stress disorder, which may have impaired his ability to control the vehicle. The police officer also reported that V1 traveled off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating poor directional control. These factors, including excessive speed and medication use, contributed to the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
