The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, an eighteen-year-old male, did not have a valid driver's license. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating poor directional control. The associative factors of rain and a wet roadway may have contributed to the loss of control, but ultimately it was the driver's lack of skill and experience, as well as the absence of a valid driver's license, that make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
