The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 braked but started to slide on the wet roadway, causing the vehicle to slide into and through the intersection, ultimately colliding with the curb and descending the embankment. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle on the wet surface suggests a lack of proper caution and control, making Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
