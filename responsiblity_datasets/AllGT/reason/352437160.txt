The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 skidded on the wet roadway surface and entered the southbound lane, causing the collision with Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 2 failed to maintain control of their vehicle while negotiating the curved and graded section of roadway, which resulted in the collision.
