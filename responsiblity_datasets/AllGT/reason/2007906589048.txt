The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway on the right side and made contact with the parked vehicles (V2, V3, V4, and V5) in the parking lane. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was being arrested for DUI, indicating that impaired driving may have been a contributing factor to the crash.
