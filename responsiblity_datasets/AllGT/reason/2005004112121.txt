The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 drifted off the right side of the roadway and struck a tree. The driver of V1 stated that she was traveling around 30 MPH and did not know why she hit the tree. Additionally, she mentioned that her steering wheel was not working properly, which may have contributed to the crash. As the driver of V1, she had the responsibility to maintain control of her vehicle and stay within the roadway. The failure of the steering system, if proven, could be a contributing factor, but ultimately, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle.
