The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they entered the intersection even though their light had turned red. This indicates a violation of traffic laws and failure to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1996 Nissan XES) who had the green light. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being "stuck" and unable to react in time to stop at the red light. This suggests a recognition error and inattention on the part of the driver, possibly due to fatigue from working long hours. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the red light and their recognition error/inattention make them primarily responsible for the accident.
