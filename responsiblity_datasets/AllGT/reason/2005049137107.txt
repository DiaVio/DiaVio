The reason for this is that V1 was traveling off the road to the left side, entered the curbed median, and impacted a light pole. Additionally, the driver of V1 was arrested for public intoxication and had been drinking, although he did not admit to operating the vehicle. The police reported that the driver's critical non-performance was unknown, as there were no driver interviews or witnesses. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impairment and the vehicle's movement off the road.
