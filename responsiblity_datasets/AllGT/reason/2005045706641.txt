The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to adequately surveil the road ahead. The driver admitted to being distracted by something in the rearview mirror and did not notice Vehicle 2 stopped on the highway until it was too late to avoid a collision. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance contributed to the accident.
