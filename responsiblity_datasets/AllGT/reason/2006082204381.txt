The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing anyone approaching the intersection or the red light, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving. Additionally, the driver was fatigued due to a long day of work and school, which could have impaired their ability to react to the situation on the road. Furthermore, it is mentioned that this was a new route for the driver, and they were lost in thought while driving. This lack of familiarity with the roadway, combined with being mentally distracted, likely contributed to the driver's failure to notice the approaching vehicle (V2) and the red light. On the other hand, there is no known pre-crash information about the driver of V2, and no critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the available information, V2 does not appear to be primarily responsible for the accident.
