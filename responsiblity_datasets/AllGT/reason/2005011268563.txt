The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the 43-year-old male driver of the Ford Crown Victoria). V1 did not realize that V2 was stopping to make a left-hand turn and collided with the back of V2 when she saw it stopped in front of her. Additionally, the contributing factors of V1's limited driving experience (only three months) and unfamiliarity with the vehicle (only had it for two weeks) may have played a role in her inadequate surveillance and false assumption.
