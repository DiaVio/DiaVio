The reason for this is that V2 struck V1 from behind while V1 was stopped in the intersection due to the approaching ambulance. V2 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of V1. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, stopped in the lane," indicating that V2 was aware of V1's presence but failed to react appropriately.
