The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 pulled out into traffic without yielding the right of way to V2, causing the collision. The eyewitness account confirms that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and then entered the intersection for an unapparent reason, directly in front of V2. This action by V1 is a violation of traffic rules and indicates a failure to exercise caution and yield to oncoming traffic.
