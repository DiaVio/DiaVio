The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver claimed to have come to a complete stop at the stop sign for more than 10 seconds, but still failed to see V1 approaching. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and failure to ensure the intersection was clear before proceeding. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned that the roadway design made it difficult to see, which suggests a lack of awareness and preparedness while driving. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly check for oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
