The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being internally distracted, specifically looking at items in the front seat area that started to fall. This distraction caused the driver of V1 to take their eyes off the road, resulting in them not being able to stop in time and colliding with the rear bumper of V2. V2 (the 1997 Dodge 2500 pickup) was stopped to make a left turn at the 'T' intersection, indicating that V2 was following proper traffic rules and was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain proper attention on the road make them primarily responsible for the accident.
