The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound in the left travel lane when it impacted the left side of V1, which was executing a left turn to travel southbound. V2 had the right of way as it was traveling straight through the intersection, while V1 was required to yield and ensure it was safe to make the left turn. The impact occurred on the left side of V1, indicating that V2 had the right of way and V1 failed to yield. Additionally, both vehicles rotated counterclockwise (CCW) after the initial impact, suggesting that V2 had the momentum and V1 was struck by the front of V2. This further supports the conclusion that V2 was primarily responsible for the crash. It is important to note that the deployment of airbags and the injuries sustained by the occupants may be relevant in determining the severity of the crash and the potential liability of each party involved, but it does not change the primary responsibility for the accident.
