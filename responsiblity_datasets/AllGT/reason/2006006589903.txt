The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound and crossed over the intersection against a red light. The witness confirmed that V2 drove through the signalized red light, and the driver of V2 admitted that he thought he had the green light. This illegal maneuver of running the red light directly caused the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 was inexperienced with driving this particular vehicle and rarely traveled on this roadway, which may have contributed to his misjudgment of the traffic signal.
