The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 passed through the intersection while the traffic light was red, indicating a decision error. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 2 stated that she was unable to stop in time due to poor braking performance, which suggests that she was traveling too fast for the wet conditions. The hydroplaning situation further supports the conclusion that Vehicle 2 was not driving at an appropriate speed for the weather conditions.
