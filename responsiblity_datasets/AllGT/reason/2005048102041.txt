The reason for this is that V1 lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions, specifically slick roads caused by heavy rain. V1 hydroplaned and rotated counterclockwise, ultimately colliding with V2 (the driver of the 2005 Dodge MPV) in the merging lane. The overinflated tires and the fact that V1 was traveling at an unknown speed also contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
