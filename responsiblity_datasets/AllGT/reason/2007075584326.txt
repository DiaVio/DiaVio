The driver of V1 was legally intoxicated with a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.236, which is almost three times the legal limit. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 113 kmph (70 mph), which is twice the posted speed limit. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was impaired and driving recklessly, resulting in the initial collision with V2 and subsequent collisions with V3, V4, and V5.
