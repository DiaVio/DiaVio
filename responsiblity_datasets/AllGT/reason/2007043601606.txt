The reason for this is that the driver reported that the trailer began to "shimmy and sway" after driving over a small bump in the road. Instead of properly controlling the situation, the driver lightly tapped the brake pedal, which only made things worse. This indicates a lack of proper handling and control of the vehicle and trailer. Additionally, the driver admitted to being unfamiliar with the truck, as it was only the third time he had driven it. This lack of familiarity with the vehicle, combined with the fact that he had never towed anything with this truck before, suggests a lack of experience and knowledge in handling a trailer. Furthermore, the driver mentioned that he may have loaded too much weight behind the trailer's wheels, indicating a potential error in properly distributing the weight of the cargo. This improper loading of the trailer could have contributed to the instability and loss of control. Overall, the driver's lack of proper handling, unfamiliarity with the vehicle, and potential error in loading the trailer make him primarily responsible for the accident.
