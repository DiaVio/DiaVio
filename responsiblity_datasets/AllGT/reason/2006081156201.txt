The critical pre-crash event for V1 was that it was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which resulted in the vehicle crossing into oncoming traffic and colliding with V2. The driver of V1 was found to have lost control of the vehicle and was traveling too fast for the curve, considering the wet road conditions and under-inflated tires as contributing factors. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 (the 1996 Dodge Caravan) was listed as "other motor vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's loss of control and crossing into oncoming traffic.
