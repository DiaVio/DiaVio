The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 accelerated from its parked position and collided with Vehicle 3, causing it to cross over the median and enter the eastbound travel lanes. As Vehicle 1 approached from the west, Vehicle 2's frontal plane struck the front left area of Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 initiated the chain of events that led to the collision.
