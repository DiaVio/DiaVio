The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was found to be severely intoxicated, which was confirmed by the police officer on the scene who smelled alcohol on the driver and conducted a field sobriety test. The driver's intoxication likely impaired their ability to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the vehicle drifting off the road and ultimately colliding with a utility pole.
