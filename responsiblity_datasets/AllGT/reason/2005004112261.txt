The reason for this is that V2, the 1993 Chevy Corsica Sedan, failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and proceeded through the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. The driver of V2 admitted to looking but not seeing V1, the 2005 Dodge Stratus Sedan, before the collision occurred. Additionally, the driver of V2 was distracted by conversing with passengers at the time of the crash. These factors indicate that V2's actions and lack of attention were the main cause of the accident.
