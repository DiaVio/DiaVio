The reason for this is that V2 attempted to merge into V1's lane, crossing a solid double line, which is an illegal maneuver. V2's right side sideswiped the left side of V1, causing damage and dragging V1 several feet. Additionally, V2 fled the scene immediately after the crash, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
