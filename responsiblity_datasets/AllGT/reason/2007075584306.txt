The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the driver of the GMC Yukon) while making a left turn at the intersection. This misjudgment, combined with the influence of her mother's statement that she could make the turn, and her own inexperience as a driver (only seven months of driving experience), led to the collision. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. However, the critical reason for the crash was not coded to V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her misjudgment and inexperience.
