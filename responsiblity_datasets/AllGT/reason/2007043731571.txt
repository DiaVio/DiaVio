The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by reaching for a bottle of water on the front right seat. This distraction caused her to drive off the right side of the roadway and lose control of the vehicle when she tried to swerve back onto the roadway. Additionally, the driver was operating the vehicle during a time when her license permit restricts her from driving. These factors, combined with the driver's inexperience, contributed to the accident.
