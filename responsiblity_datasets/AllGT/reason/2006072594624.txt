The driver of V1 stated that they were unable to recognize that traffic had stopped due to sun glare from the back-light of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others, as the rush hour traffic was stop and go. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and rear-ending V2 initiated the chain reaction that led to the collision with V3.
