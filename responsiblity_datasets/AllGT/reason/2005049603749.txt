The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection without having a protective left turn from oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the driver of the 1996 Ford Ranger pick up) would make a right turn since it was using the right travel lane. This false assumption of other's actions by the driver of V1 led to the collision with V2, resulting in the crash.
