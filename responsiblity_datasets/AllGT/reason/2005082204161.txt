The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop in time and collided with the back of V2 (the Toyota Celica), which then collided with the back of V3's trailer. V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down at his cell phone, which caused him to not notice the stopped traffic ahead and not have enough time to brake and avoid the collision. This distraction and failure to pay attention to the road are clear indications of negligence on the part of V1.
