The driver of Vehicle #1 was intoxicated, as evidenced by being videoed at a local nightclub in an intoxicated state prior to the crash. This impaired state likely contributed to the driver's inability to negotiate the curve properly, resulting in the vehicle edging off the left side of the road. Additionally, the driver's overcorrection and poor directional control further exacerbated the situation, leading to the vehicle departing the right side of the road and ultimately crashing into the guardrail and rolling down the embankment. The driver's failure to wear a seatbelt also contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained in the crash.
