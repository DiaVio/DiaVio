The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 accelerated while negotiating the curve of the entrance ramp, which caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise and lose control. This indicates poor directional control and traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. The driver's inexperience may have also contributed to the inability to regain control of the vehicle.
