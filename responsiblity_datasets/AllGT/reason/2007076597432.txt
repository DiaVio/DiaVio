The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (60 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph) for the wet road conditions. The driver failed to recognize the need for caution and adjust their speed accordingly, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent rollover.
