The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed that was 16 kmph (10 mph) above the posted speed limit. This indicates that the driver was exceeding the safe speed for the conditions of the roadway, which was a downhill left curved roadway. The critical per-crash event was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," further supporting the driver's responsibility. Additionally, the driver stated that he steered right to avoid other vehicles, suggesting that he may have been distracted or not fully focused on the road, contributing to the loss of control. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed and inability to respond to unexpected actions of others, as indicated by the critical reason coded in the police report.
