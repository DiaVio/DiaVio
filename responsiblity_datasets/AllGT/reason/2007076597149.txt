The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being coded as a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver's statement that she glanced into the left door mirror to check for traffic suggests that her attention was not fully focused on the road ahead, contributing to the collision with V2. It is important to note that V2 (the driver of the 1996 Toyota Tacoma pickup) was also involved in the crash, but the critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the accident based on the information provided.
