The reason for this is that Vehicle one was traveling southbound in the north leg of the alley and attempted to turn left onto the roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic. Vehicle two (1985 Toyota Camry) was traveling westbound on the roadway and had the right of way. The front of Vehicle two struck the left side of Vehicle one, indicating that Vehicle one failed to yield and turned into the path of Vehicle two. Therefore, Vehicle one's failure to yield and turn left without ensuring it was safe to do so makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
