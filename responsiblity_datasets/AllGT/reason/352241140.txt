The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, while traveling eastbound, entered the westbound travel lane and collided with Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Mercedes-Benz C230 4-door sedan) in a head-on type collision. This indicates that Vehicle 1 crossed over into the opposing lane of traffic, resulting in the collision.
