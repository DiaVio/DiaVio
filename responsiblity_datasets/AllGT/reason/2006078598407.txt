The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded through the intersection illegally. This is indicated by the critical pre-crash event for V1 being coded as a driver-related factor: illegal maneuver. V2 (the driver of the 1989 GMC Jimmy) stated that V1 did not stop at the stop sign but slowed down and then proceeded through the intersection. This suggests that V1's failure to stop at the stop sign was a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and proceed through the intersection illegally makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
