The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 fled the scene after the collision, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. Additionally, the police report states that the vehicle's brakes were inoperative, which is a vehicle-related factor that contributed to the loss of control. Despite the brake failure, the driver should have maintained directional control and brought the vehicle to a controlled stop. The driver's failure to do so further supports their primary responsibility for the collision.
