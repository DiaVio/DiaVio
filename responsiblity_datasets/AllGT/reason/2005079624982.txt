The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The driver of V1 admitted to glancing both ways but did not see V2 approaching due to parked vehicles blocking their view. This indicates a recognition error on the part of V1, as they failed to look properly and did not see the oncoming vehicle.
