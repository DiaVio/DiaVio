The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a curved icy road. The driver admitted to feeling that she was going too fast and applied her brakes, causing her vehicle to slide into the back of Vehicle two (the 1998 Dodge Caravan). This indicates a decision error on the part of the driver of Vehicle one. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one stated that she steered right after the initial impact, causing her vehicle to hit a utility pole and then steer left, ultimately sliding across the road and coming to rest facing southward. This suggests inadequate and incorrect evasive actions taken by the driver. Therefore, based on the driver's inexperience, driving too fast for the conditions, loss of control due to weather, and inadequate/incorrect evasive actions, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash.
