The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive speed, as indicated by the Critical Pre-Crash Event being control loss due to excess speed. This excessive speed prevented the driver from being able to respond effectively to the unexpected actions of another vehicle on the road. Additionally, the witness statement suggests that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and came up fast upon a slower-moving vehicle. The driver's sudden braking and sharp steering maneuver to avoid the slower vehicle ultimately led to the loss of control and the subsequent collision with the cement barrier. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to maintain control of the vehicle in response to the situation make them primarily responsible for the crash.
