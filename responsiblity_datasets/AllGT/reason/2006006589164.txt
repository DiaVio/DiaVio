The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by adjusting the radio control, which was coded as an internal distraction. This distraction likely caused her to fail to notice the stopped vehicles ahead of her and subsequently collide with the rear of V2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina). Although V1 mentioned being tired and getting less sleep than usual, fatigue was coded as an associated factor rather than the primary cause of the accident. The driver's fatigue may have contributed to her reduced attention and slower reaction time, but the primary responsibility lies with the distraction caused by adjusting the radio. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors, specifically the internal distraction of adjusting the radio control.
