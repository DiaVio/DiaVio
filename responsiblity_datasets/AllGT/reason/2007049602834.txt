The driver of V1 stated that she stopped at the stop sign but did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, which is classified as a driver-related error of inadequate surveillance. On the other hand, no critical reason was coded for V2, suggesting that the driver of V2 did not contribute to the accident.
