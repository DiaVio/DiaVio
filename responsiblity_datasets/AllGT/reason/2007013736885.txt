The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced diabetic shock, which impaired his ability to act and control the vehicle. This physical impairment led to V1 departing the roadway and subsequently colliding with various objects. The driver's lack of recollection and inability to provide insight further support the conclusion that V1's driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle due to his medical condition.
