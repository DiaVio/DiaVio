The driver of V1 admitted to making a mistake by accelerating through the intersection even though the traffic signal was turning red. This decision error and illegal maneuver, along with the false assumption that traffic would yield the right of way, led to the collision with V2. V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and exercise caution while entering the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
