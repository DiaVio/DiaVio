The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2, resulting in a full frontal collision. The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline while negotiating a right curve, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the lack of restraint use by the driver of Vehicle 1, as evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seat belt system, contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained in the accident.
