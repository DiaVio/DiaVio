The reason for this is that V1 was driving with a newly purchased used tire that had a partial tread and bead/rim separation, which ultimately led to a blowout. Additionally, V1 admitted to not checking the tire pressure in his tires and was unaware that two other tires were below the recommended tire pressure. These factors contributed to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent crash into the guardrail.
