The reason for this is that V1's driver departed her lane to the left while attempting to exit the freeway at the off ramp area. V1 then continued north and ultimately ended up in the ditch, resulting in the deployment of the side curtain airbags. This indicates that V1's driver lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, leading to the accident.
