The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that her view of the roadway was obscured by sun glare immediately after turning onto the eastbound roadway. Despite this, she proceeded down the road without being able to see clearly and ultimately struck the rear of V2 (the 2002 Freightliner tractor-trailer) that was stopped in traffic. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes at the last moment, indicating a lack of proper judgment and reaction time. While V2 was also affected by sun glare and unfamiliarity with the roadway, V2 was stopped in traffic and took no avoidance maneuver. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not being able to see clearly and failing to avoid the collision.
