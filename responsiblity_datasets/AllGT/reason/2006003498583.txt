The driver of V1 stated that she was pulling out of the parking spot on the left side of the roadway and did not see V2 (the 1996 Plymouth Neon). The critical reason for the critical event involving V1 was inadequate surveillance, specifically that the driver looked but did not see V2. This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic before pulling out, resulting in the collision.
