The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2 (the Ford Taurus) without adequately surveilling the intersection. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see any approaching vehicles before making the turn and was focused on his left side, failing to look far enough ahead. Additionally, the driver claimed that the curvature of the roadway north of the intersection blocked his view, but the researcher's approach photos show that the curvature was not a factor and V2 should have been visible. On the other hand, V2 was traveling within the speed limit and preparing to go straight through the intersection. The driver of V2 did not see V1 and took no evasive actions before the impact. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
