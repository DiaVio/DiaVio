The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control while exiting a right curve, crossed the double yellow line, and traveled off the south road edge. This resulted in the vehicle rolling over and ultimately colliding with a large tree. The driver's loss of control and failure to stay within the lane contributed to the crash.
