The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she entered the intersection and turned left without seeing V2 (the 2006 Chrysler Town and Country) approaching from the opposite direction. This indicates a failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, which is a common cause of left-turn accidents. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted and frustrated due to an argument with her passengers, which could have further impaired her ability to properly assess the traffic situation. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was driving within their lane and did not contribute to the crash. However, V2's inadequate surveillance was mentioned as an associated factor, indicating that they could have potentially taken measures to avoid the collision if they had noticed V1's improper left turn earlier. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn and her distracted state. V2's inadequate surveillance is mentioned as an associated factor but does not absolve V1 of her primary responsibility.
