The reason for V2's responsibility is that he failed to maintain control of his vehicle and was unable to stop or steer properly, resulting in him colliding with the rear of V1 (the Ford Escape SUV). V2 stated that his vehicle had lost power and his brakes were not working, indicating a vehicle failure, specifically a transmission or engine failure. This failure led to the loss of control and subsequent collision. Additionally, V2 attempted to steer to the right after the initial impact, but was unable to stop the vehicle, ultimately crashing into an electrical box off the roadway. This further demonstrates V2's inability to control the vehicle and avoid the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain control of his vehicle and the resulting collision make him primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
