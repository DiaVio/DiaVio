The reason for this is that the case vehicle, the 2005 Dodge Magnum station wagon, was traveling on a seven-lane divided traffic-way and had the right of way. V2, on the other hand, was southbound on the intersecting eight-lane divided traffic-way and failed to yield to the case vehicle. V2 crossed the path of the case vehicle, resulting in a collision where the front of V2 struck the right fender of the case vehicle. This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
