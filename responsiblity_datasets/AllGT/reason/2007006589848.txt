The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a seizure, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and enter the intersection at a high rate of speed. The passenger, who was interviewed as a surrogate, confirmed that the driver had a seizure and was unresponsive during the incident. The witness also observed the driver slouching in his seat and then suddenly speeding up. The critical pre-crash event coded to V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," which indicates that V1 veered off the road and crashed into the building due to the driver's physical impairment caused by the seizure. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's medical condition and resulting loss of control.
