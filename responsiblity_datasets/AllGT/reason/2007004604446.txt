The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through it, even though she stopped at the stop sign. This lack of surveillance led to her not seeing V2 (the Jeep Cherokee) approaching from the left side, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield the right of way to V2 makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
