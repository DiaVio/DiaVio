The driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to travel onto the sod median, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver overcompensated after the roadway departure, leading to a clockwise rotation and subsequent rollover. The driver's poor directional control and failure to adapt to the icy and slick road conditions further contribute to their responsibility for the accident.
