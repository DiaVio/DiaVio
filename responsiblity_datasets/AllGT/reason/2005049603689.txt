The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to making an illegal maneuver by not stopping at the stop sign and attempting to cross through the intersection without ensuring it was clear. Additionally, the driver admitted to drinking and not having a driver's license or insurance, which further demonstrates negligence on their part. V2 (the driver of the 1990 Buick LeSabre) was traveling straight and had the right of way since they were on the main road with no stop sign. Therefore, V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1's illegal maneuver, failure to stop at the stop sign, and impaired state make them primarily responsible for the accident.
