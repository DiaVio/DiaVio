The reason for this is that V1 was traveling north in the second lane and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical reason for the crash was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2) traveling west in the first lane. This resulted in V1's front impacting the left side of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield the right of way to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
