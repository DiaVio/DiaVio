The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was overcompensating while attempting to steer back into the right lane. This overcompensation caused V1 to rotate clockwise, leading to the collision with the east curb and subsequent rollover. Additionally, the driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .128 two hours after the crash indicates that they were driving under the influence, which likely impaired their judgment and ability to control the vehicle properly.
