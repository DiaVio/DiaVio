The reason for this is that V1's driver departed the roadway to the right while negotiating a left curve. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the wire fence and tree. Additionally, the driver was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of the injuries sustained.
