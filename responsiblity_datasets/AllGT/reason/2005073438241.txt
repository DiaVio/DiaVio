The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, according to witnesses. Additionally, the investigating officer's report stated that the driver of V1 was legally intoxicated. This combination of disregarding the stop sign and driving under the influence constitutes a decision error and an illegal maneuver, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
