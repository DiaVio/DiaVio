The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a false assumption of the other vehicle's actions. The driver stated that he got halfway out and stopped, assuming that the other vehicle would go around him. However, Vehicle #2 (the 2005 Nissan Altima) was traveling on the main road and had the right of way. Vehicle #1 should have yielded to the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, it should be noted that the driver of Vehicle #1 takes prescription medications for high blood pressure and back pain, which state drowsiness as a possible side effect. This could have impaired the driver's judgment and reaction time, contributing to the false assumption and the failure to yield. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's false assumption and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
