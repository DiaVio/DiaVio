The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she turned left across the westbound lanes without having a clear view of V2 (the Dodge Intrepid) due to an obstructed view caused by a non-contact large truck in the eastbound lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 may have been emotionally distressed and fatigued, which could have affected her decision-making and judgment. Therefore, V1's failure to ensure a clear and safe left turn, despite the obstructed view and potential distractions, makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
