The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident. The vehicle went over the curb, sideswiped a tree, ran over two tree stumps, and ultimately struck a tree with its left-front bumper. The rotation of the vehicle around the tree indicates a loss of control, suggesting that the driver was unable to maintain proper control of the vehicle in the wet and rainy conditions. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
