The eyewitness account states that V1 crossed the double-yellow lines and drove directly into the path of V2. This indicates that V1 was in the wrong lane and driving in the opposite direction of traffic. Additionally, the witness mentioned that V1 appeared to have intentionally driven into oncoming traffic, suggesting a deliberate action on the part of the driver. Without further information or interviews from the drivers, it is difficult to determine the exact reason for V1's actions. However, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that V1's decision to cross into the opposite lane and drive into oncoming traffic was the primary cause of the accident.
