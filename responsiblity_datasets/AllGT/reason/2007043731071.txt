The driver of V1 was distracted by talking to her children and possibly turning her head to look at them, which caused her to veer off the right side of the road. This distraction led to the vehicle striking a culvert, a fence, and a tree. Additionally, the driver's mental health issues and use of medication for her illness may have contributed to her lack of driving skills and ability to maintain control of the vehicle.
