The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. This is evident from the fact that V1 struck the rear of V2 when V2 slowed down due to congested traffic ahead. The driver of V1 claimed to be attentive to the driving task and aware of V2 in front of him, but he could not stop in time and had to apply the brakes as an evasive maneuver. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from V2, which resulted in the collision.
