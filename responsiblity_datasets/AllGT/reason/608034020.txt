The reason for this is that V2 entered the path of the case vehicle (V1) while it was crossing the intersection. V1 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, indicating that V1 had the right of way and was already in the intersection when V2 entered. The impact occurred when V2 struck the left side of V1, causing both vehicles to rotate and sustain damage. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident as it failed to yield the right of way and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision.
