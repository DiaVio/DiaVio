The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: false assumption of other's actions. Additionally, inadequate surveillance was identified as an additional factor. This suggests that V2 failed to properly assess the situation and wrongly assumed that V1 would yield or take a different action. This false assumption, combined with inadequate surveillance, led to the collision. Therefore, V2 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
