The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a coughing spell and having his head turned downward, which caused him to drift across the road and collide with the parked vehicle. Additionally, the driver's illness and medication may have impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling over the lane line on the left side further supports the driver's lack of control and attention.
