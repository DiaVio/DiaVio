The reason for this is that V2 lost traction after striking a pool of water in the roadway, causing it to travel off the left side of the roadway and into the northbound lane where V1 (the 2008 Nissan Altima) was traveling. The collision occurred when V1's front left struck V2's front left in an offset frontal configuration. Therefore, V2's loss of control and crossing into the opposite lane led to the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
