The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at a stop sign, preparing to turn right, but failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2002 Chevrolet half-ton Silverado pick-up) who was traveling southbound. V1 attempted to make a right turn into the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and inattentive, as she was talking on a cell phone and getting directions from her passenger. This further supports the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
