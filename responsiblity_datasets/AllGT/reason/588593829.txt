The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 62-year-old male driver, entered the intersection at the same time as Vehicle 2 (the 2002 GMC Sierra) and attempted to steer right to avoid a collision. However, this steering maneuver was unsuccessful, resulting in the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 striking the right front plane of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, causing the collision.
