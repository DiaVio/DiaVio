The reason for V2's responsibility is that they encroached over the left lane line, which resulted in the collision with V1. Since V2 was traveling east in lane two and negotiating a left curve, they should have maintained their lane and not crossed over into the opposite lane. This encroachment caused the front of V1 to impact the front of V2, leading to the loss of control of V1 and subsequent collision.
