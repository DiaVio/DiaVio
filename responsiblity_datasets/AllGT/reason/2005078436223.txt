The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that initially braked and tapped the rear bumper of V2 (the 1986 Honda Accord). This action caused V2 to stop in traffic, leading to the subsequent collision with V3 (the 1979 Chevrolet Camaro). V1's external distraction was identified as a driver-related factor, indicating that the driver's lack of attention likely contributed to the accident.
