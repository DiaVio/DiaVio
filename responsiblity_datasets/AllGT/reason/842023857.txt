The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling on a two-lane rural roadway and departed the right pavement edge, resulting in a series of impacts with mailboxes, roadside brush, a small sign, and the ground. These impacts caused minor to moderate damage to Vehicle 1. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 sustained serious injuries and had to be transported to a hospital for treatment. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the resulting damage and injuries, Vehicle 1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
