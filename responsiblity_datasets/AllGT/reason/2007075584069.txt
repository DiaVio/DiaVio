The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making her left turn. She did not look towards her left front as she turned, as her attention was focused on the cross traffic. This failure to properly observe her surroundings led to her not seeing the presence of V2 (the driver of the 1998 Dodge Ram) before the impact occurred. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look towards her left front as she turned are the main factors that contributed to the accident, making her primarily responsible.
