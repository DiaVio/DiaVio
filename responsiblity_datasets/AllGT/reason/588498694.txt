The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the left southbound travel lane and collided with the front right plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Venture minivan) while it was making a left turn. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
