The reason for this is that V1 was intoxicated with a BAC of .18, which is well above the legal limit. Intoxication impairs judgment, reaction time, and coordination, making it highly likely that the driver's ability to safely navigate the intersection was compromised. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as turning left at the intersection, indicating that V1 was attempting a left turn without yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic. While the wet road conditions and rain may have contributed to the accident, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's intoxication and failure to yield.
