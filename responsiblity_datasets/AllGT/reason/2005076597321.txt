The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Additionally, the driver failed to adjust their speed to the road and atmosphere conditions, specifically the sun glare that obstructed their vision of the upcoming curve. This lack of visibility, combined with the driver's excessive speed, led to their inability to successfully negotiate the curve, resulting in V1 going off the road and ultimately rolling over. The driver was issued a citation for speed not reasonable and prudent, further indicating their responsibility in the accident.
