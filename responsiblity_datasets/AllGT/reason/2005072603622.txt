The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost track of the location and passed the intended exit. When the driver realized this, they made a sudden lane change without proper control, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle. This overcompensation by the driver led to the vehicle colliding with a large concrete bridge support wall. Additionally, the driver's fatigue and hurry to get home to sleep may have contributed to their lack of attention and poor decision-making while driving.
