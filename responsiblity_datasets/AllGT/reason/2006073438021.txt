The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn on the exit ramp. This is evident from the fact that V1 began to slide in a clockwise rotation while negotiating the curve, indicating excessive speed. Additionally, the driver admitted that he waited too long before entering the curve, further confirming that he was not adequately prepared for the turn. Furthermore, the driver's lack of familiarity with the roadway and the vehicle, as well as his distraction due to conversing with the passenger, contributed to his inability to safely navigate the curve. The driver's fatigue and emotional concerns may have also impaired his judgment and reaction time. Overall, V1's excessive speed, lack of preparation, distraction, and potential impairment make them primarily responsible for the crash.
