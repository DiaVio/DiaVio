The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield to V2 (the driver of the Mercedes) who was going straight. V2 stated that he saw the truck at the intersection and believed that the driver of V1 saw him coming, but V1 continued to turn left in front of him. This indicates that V1 made a decision error and displayed aggressive driving behavior by not yielding to oncoming traffic. Additionally, V2 attempted to avoid the collision by swerving to the left and jamming on the brakes, further indicating that V1's failure to yield was the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while turning left at the intersection.
