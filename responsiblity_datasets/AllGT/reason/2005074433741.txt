The driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, crossed over into lane one, and collided with V2 in a sideswipe impact. V1 then continued south and collided with the left side of V3. The critical reason for the crash was coded as "sleeping, that is actually asleep" for V1. The associative factor of driver fatigue due to working excessive hours in hot weather and insufficient sleep pattern further supports V1's responsibility for the accident.
