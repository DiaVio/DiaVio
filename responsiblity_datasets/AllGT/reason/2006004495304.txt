The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was fleeing from the police after being involved in two prior traffic crashes. V1 was under the influence of alcohol and was traveling at a high rate of speed while attempting to evade the police. The driver of V1 engaged in aggressive acts such as speeding, rapid/frequent lane changes, and ignoring traffic control devices. Additionally, V1 made a false assumption that the driver of V2 would yield the right of way and chose inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action by attempting to go around V2 instead of yielding. On the other hand, V2 (the 2001 Ford Crown Victoria) was stopped just over the centerline in an attempt to apprehend V1. The driver of V2 was talking on a police radio at the time of the crash and was also experiencing work-related stress due to a rotating shift schedule. However, these factors do not contribute to V2's primary responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their illegal maneuver, aggressive driving, and failure to yield to V2.
