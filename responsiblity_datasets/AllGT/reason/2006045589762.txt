The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2003 Nissan Sentra) while making a left turn at the intersection. V1 claimed to have a solid green light with no turn arrow, but V2 was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V1 was a driver-related factor, specifically a false assumption of others' actions. This indicates that the driver of V1 made an incorrect assumption about the actions of V2, leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to yield and making a false assumption about the actions of the other vehicle.
