The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 71-year old female driver, struck the right side plane of Vehicle 2, the 2001 Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling east and intended to cross through the intersection. The collision occurred when Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and collided with the right front corner of Vehicle 2. Therefore, based on the sequence of events described, Vehicle 1's failure to yield and resulting collision with Vehicle 2 suggests that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
