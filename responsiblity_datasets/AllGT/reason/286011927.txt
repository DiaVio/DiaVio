The reason for this is that V1 was traveling behind V2 and impacted the back end of V2 in an offset manner. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 continued to travel off the roadway and ultimately impacted a utility pole, indicating a lack of control or negligence on the part of the driver of V1.
