The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it entered a clockwise rotation, departed the roadway on the right, and entered a cultivated field. This indicates that V1 veered off the road and lost control, resulting in the rollover. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. However, it is important to note that the critical reason for the crash is listed as "unknown reason" due to the lack of available information from the driver or witnesses.
