The reason for this is that V1 was unable to avoid hitting the deer that suddenly bolted into the roadway. The driver attempted to steer right to avoid the deer, but ultimately ended up losing control of the vehicle and crashing into an embankment and utility pole. The driver's inability to avoid the collision with the deer is considered an other recognition error, as it was a sudden and unexpected event.
