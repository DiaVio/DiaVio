The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the red light and turned left through the intersection, causing the collision with V2. V2, on the other hand, entered the intersection when the traffic signal had turned green for her, indicating that she had the right of way. V2 stated that she had slammed on the brakes but could not avoid V1, indicating that she took appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for the red light and turning left through the intersection against the traffic signal makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
