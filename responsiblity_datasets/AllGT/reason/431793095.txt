The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling at a high speed and failed to negotiate a left curve, causing it to veer off the road and into a wooded area. The driver's steering inputs, possibly in an attempt to avoid the impending collision, redirected the vehicle towards a stand of trees. This resulted in multiple impacts with trees, causing moderate damage to the vehicle. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the subsequent collisions indicate that Vehicle 1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
