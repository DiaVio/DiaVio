The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to stop behind V2 (the 1999 Toyota Camry) when V2 had already come to a stop on the ramp, waiting for an opening in the traffic to enter the roadway. V1's false assumption of V2's actions led to the collision. Despite V1's claim of slamming on the brakes, they still struck V2 and then hit the guardrail. V2, on the other hand, had stopped in the merge lane due to traffic approaching and was waiting for an opening. While V2's internal distraction of engaging in conversation with her children may have contributed to the crash, it does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to stop in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stop behind V2, resulting in the collision.
