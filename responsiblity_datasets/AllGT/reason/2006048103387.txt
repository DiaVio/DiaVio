The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver changed lanes from lane three to lane four without ensuring it was safe to do so. This lane change was made in response to the front right passenger's instruction to make a left turn. However, V1 failed to properly check for other vehicles in the adjacent lane before changing lanes, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2003 Ford Windstar van). Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event of V1 was coded as internal distraction due to passengers giving directions. This suggests that the driver's attention was diverted from the road, further contributing to the driver's failure to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's improper lane change and internal distraction.
