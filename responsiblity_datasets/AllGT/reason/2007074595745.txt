The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and daydreaming, which led to him not paying attention to the road and failing to notice that V2 was stopped. This inattention and failure to react in time resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction that led to V2 colliding with V3. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
