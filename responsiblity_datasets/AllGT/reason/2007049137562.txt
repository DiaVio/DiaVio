The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling on the wrong side of the road (southbound in the northbound lane). This is a clear violation of traffic rules and regulations, as well as a failure to recognize the roadway as a two-way street. V1's critical pre-crash event of traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane indicates that they were not in the correct lane and were not properly positioned on the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that they believed the road to be a one-way street, which further demonstrates their lack of recognition and understanding of the roadway conditions. While V2 (the driver of the 1998 Buick Century) was traveling in the correct lane, their critical pre-crash event of encountering another motor vehicle in the opposite direction suggests that they were not at fault for the crash. The responsibility lies with V1 for their incorrect positioning and failure to recognize the roadway as a two-way street.
