The reason for this is that V-1 pulled onto the right shoulder and stopped, intending to make a U-turn to travel eastbound. However, V-1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V-2 (the Ford F-250 pick-up), which was traveling behind V-1 in the westbound lane. As V-1 began to make the U-turn, it was struck on the left side by the front of V-2. V-2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering to the left and braking, indicating that V-2 was taking evasive action to prevent the accident. The critical reason for V-2's involvement in the accident was a "False assumption of other's actions," suggesting that V-2 assumed V-1 would not make the U-turn or would yield the right of way. However, V-1's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe U-turn is the primary cause of the accident.
