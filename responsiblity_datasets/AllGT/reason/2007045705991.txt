The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the traffic before attempting to cross the arterial road. The driver admitted to looking to her left but failed to look to her right, which resulted in her pulling in front of V2 (the 1998 Nissan Altima) and causing the collision. Additionally, V1 was coded as an inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic. V2, on the other hand, was changing lanes from left to right and had just looked over her right shoulder to check if it was clear. V2's critical precrash event was the encroachment of V1 from the driveway across her path. While V2 was traveling at a relatively high speed, it can be argued that V1's failure to yield the right of way was the primary cause of the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
