The reason for this is that V1 entered the middle turn lane before it was supposed to, prior to the break in the painted lane lines. This action caused V2 (the driver of the 1996 Toyota Corolla) to collide with the right side front area of V1. V1's early entry into the turn lane created a situation where V2 did not have enough time to react and avoid the collision. Additionally, V1's obstructed view and sightline restriction, caused by the vehicles that had stopped to allow V2 to enter the roadway, contributed to the accident. V1's decision to enter the turn lane early, combined with the obstructed view, led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their improper entry into the turn lane and the resulting collision with V2.
