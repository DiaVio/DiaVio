The reason for this is that V1 lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise while approaching a left curve. It crossed the southbound lane, departed the road, and rolled multiple times before coming to a rest on its right side. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the rollover crash.
