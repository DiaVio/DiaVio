The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to not paying attention and possibly being distracted. He stated that he was not concentrating on any one thing and applied full ABS application only when he realized V2 was slowing down in front of him. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to maintain a safe following distance, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the 2001 Toyota Camry) is not considered to have contributed to the crash as the driver was decelerating for the traffic that was already stopped at the light. There is no indication of any fault or negligence on the part of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to stop for the traffic ahead.
