The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy conditions on the road. The driver stated that she was traveling at 64-72 kmph (40-45 mph), which is within the advisory speed limit for the roadway. However, considering the icy and slushy conditions, it can be inferred that the driver should have been driving at a lower speed to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that V1 began to rotate and the driver was unable to regain control suggests that the speed was a contributing factor to the loss of control and subsequent crash. The police reported travel speed of 64 kmph (40 mph) for V1 further supports the conclusion that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the icy road conditions.
