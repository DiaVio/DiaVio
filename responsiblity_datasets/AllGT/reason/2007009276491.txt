The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver intentionally disregarded the traffic signal and entered the intersection while being chased by police. Additionally, the driver was under the influence of drugs, specifically crack cocaine, which impaired their ability to drive safely. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, history of criminal activity, and the presence of a tire deficiency also contribute to their primary responsibility for the crash.
