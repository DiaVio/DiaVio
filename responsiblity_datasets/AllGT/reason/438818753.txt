The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 lost control in the wet conditions while negotiating a right curve on an uphill grade. It rotated clockwise, crossed over both lanes of the roadway, and struck a guardrail before being redirected into the path of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 2's loss of control and subsequent actions caused the collision.
