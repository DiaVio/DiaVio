The reason for this is that V1 struck V2 (the 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis) in the left front quarter panel, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, which was in the process of turning left to proceed east. This suggests that V1 may have been at fault for not properly observing and yielding to oncoming traffic.
