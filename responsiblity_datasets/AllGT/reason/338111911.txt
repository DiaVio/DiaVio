The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to pull up to a gas pump. V1 traveled off the gas station lot, rode over a curb, and impacted an embankment, ultimately coming to rest against a concrete wall. The driver of V1 was the only occupant and sustained critical injuries in the crash.
