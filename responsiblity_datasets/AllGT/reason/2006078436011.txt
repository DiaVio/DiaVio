The reason for V1's responsibility is that the right rear tire of the vehicle failed while it was going around a slight curve to the left. This tire failure caused V1 to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in it rotating counterclockwise and traveling across both lanes of travel. The vehicle then changed rotation and began to rotate clockwise in the eastbound lane before sliding off the left side of the roadway and rolling until it came to rest on its top. The critical event for V1 was the vehicle control loss due to the blowout/flat tire, specifically the right rear tire failure. This tire failure is considered a vehicle-related factor, which ultimately led to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the tire failure and subsequent loss of control.
