The driver of V1 made an illegal U-turn in front of V2, which caused the collision. The driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 would wait for him to complete the U-turn, leading to a false assumption. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversations with passengers and was not adequately surveilling the road before initiating the U-turn. These factors contribute to the primary responsibility of V1 for the accident.
