The driver of V1 failed to come to a complete stop at the stop sign, performing a "California stop" instead. This indicates inadequate surveillance and a failure to make an adequate check for cross traffic before entering the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to not fully stopping for the stop sign and did not have enough time to make a proper check for oncoming vehicles. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Honda Passport SUV) saw V1 coming from the side road and attempted to react by braking. However, she was unable to stop in time, suggesting that she had less time to react due to V1's failure to stop at the stop sign. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and adequately check for cross traffic before entering the intersection.
