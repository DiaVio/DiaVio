The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Land Rover L2) which was approaching from the opposite direction. The witness behind V1 stated that it appeared that V1 "just decided to turn left" and almost looked as if they were going to stop in the middle of the intersection. Additionally, there was no information obtained from the operator of V1 because no one in the vehicle spoke English. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and the lack of communication or signal indicating the turn contributed to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
