The driver of V1 was traveling too fast in the rain and rush hour traffic, and was unable to stop in time when the vehicle in front of him, V2, slowed down for the yellow light. This resulted in V1 striking the rear of V2. The driver of V1 admitted to not being able to respond to the unexpected actions of V2, indicating that he was traveling too fast to react appropriately. Additionally, the lack of interview and refusal of vehicle inspection by the driver of V1 suggests a lack of cooperation and responsibility.
