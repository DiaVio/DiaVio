The driver of V1 made an unexpected left turn in front of V2 without sufficient clearance and without signaling. This action directly caused the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .157, indicating intoxication at the time of the accident. The driver of V1 was also unrestrained, which resulted in being ejected from the vehicle and sustaining fatal injuries. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired judgment, failure to signal, and making an unsafe left turn.
