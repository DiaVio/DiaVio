The driver of V1 admitted to driving too fast for the conditions, stating that he was going about 30-35 mph on a snow-covered roadway. He also mentioned that he hit a slick spot, causing his vehicle to swerve across the centerline. Despite attempting to correct the skid and re-enter his own lane, V1 ultimately collided with V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was identified as "vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," with the critical reason being a decision error of driving too fast for the snowy road conditions. The driver of V1 also mentioned driving on an unfamiliar roadway, the blowing snow, and the snow-covered roadway as associated factors. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that she was driving at a slow speed and was on her usual route to work. She saw V1 lose control and enter her lane, but she decided against steering away from it due to oncoming traffic in the southbound lanes. She stayed in her lane and was surprised when V1 attempted to return to the southbound lane, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driving too fast for the snowy conditions and losing control of the vehicle.
