The driver of V1 was distracted by another vehicle turning in front of him and failed to properly observe his surroundings before making a left turn. This distraction caused him to not see V2 (the Pontiac Grand Am) approaching in the southbound lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not wearing his glasses at the time of the crash, which may have impaired his vision and contributed to his failure to see V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors such as distraction and failure to properly observe the road before making a turn.
