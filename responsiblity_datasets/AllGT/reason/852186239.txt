The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to a large tarp becoming unsecured from a non-contact commercial vehicle traveling ahead. This caused the driver to brake and steer left, resulting in V1 departing the roadway and impacting the ditch/culvert. The driver's loss of control and subsequent rollover can be attributed to the actions taken by the driver of V1 in response to the unsecured tarp.
