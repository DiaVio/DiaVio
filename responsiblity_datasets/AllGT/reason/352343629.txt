The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 17-year old male driver, drifted left and crossed over the northbound lane, ultimately departing the roadway and colliding with a guardrail and a tree. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position while negotiating the right turning curve.
