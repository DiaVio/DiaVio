The reason for this is that V1 lost control and began to rotate in a counterclockwise direction, crossing into the travel lane of V2. The witness stated that V1's headlights were in her face as V1 crossed from right to left in front of her, indicating that V1 was not in control of its movement. Additionally, V2 attempted to avoid V1 by swerving to the left, suggesting that V2 was not the initiating factor in the collision. Therefore, V1's loss of control and encroachment into the travel lane of V2 led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
