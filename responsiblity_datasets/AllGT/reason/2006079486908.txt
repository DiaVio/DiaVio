The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The driver's recognition error, specifically inadequate surveillance, led to the collision with V2. Despite wearing prescription bifocals, the driver did not see V2 approaching and initiated the turn, resulting in the impact. V2 (the driver of the 1997 Toyota RAV-4) also shares some responsibility for the collision. The driver of V2 reported seeing V1 waiting to turn and attempted to brake but was unable to stop in time. However, the critical reason for the collision was not attributed to V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
