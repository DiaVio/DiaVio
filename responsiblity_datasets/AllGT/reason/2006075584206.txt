The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving too fast for the road conditions, which were icy and slushy due to snowfall. The driver's inexperience and panic also contributed to the accident, as she overcompensated when the vehicle initially ran off the roadway and then ran off the left road edge. Additionally, the driver was distracted by talking to the right frontal passenger, which may have further impaired her ability to maintain control of the vehicle.
