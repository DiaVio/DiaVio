The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that she thought V2 "was going to go through the intersection" and applied the brakes when she realized that V2 was stopped. This indicates that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2, leading to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2002 Mazda Protégé) stated that she did not see V1 prior to the crash. While V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with higher speed," the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. Therefore, it can be inferred that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption of V2's actions.
