The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control of her vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions. She overcompensated by steering too abruptly to the right when a non-contact vehicle moved into her path. This overreaction led to the rotation and subsequent collision with the delineator and rock embankment. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle #1 stated in the medical report that another driver cut in front of her, but there is no additional information available to support this claim. Therefore, based on the available information, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed and overcompensation.
