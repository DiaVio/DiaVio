The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering right in an attempt to avoid a head-on collision with the non-contact vehicle. This action caused V1 to strike V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Silverado) from the front right side. Additionally, V1 continued forward, drove off the roadway, and struck a tree. The driver of V1's decision to steer right instead of braking or taking other appropriate actions contributed to the collision with V2 and subsequent crash.
