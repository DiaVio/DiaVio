The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the 2005 Suzuki Forenza sedan, attempted to make a U-turn across the southbound lanes without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 crossed the lane line and did not see V2, the 1994 Freightliner Day Cab tractor, approaching from behind. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he froze and took no further action when he saw V2 approaching, indicating a performance error on his part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and a performance error.
