The reason for this is that V1 made an unknown decision error by attempting to move from the HOV lane to lane four, resulting in the vehicle striking the traffic barrels and subsequently colliding with V2. The driver of V1 claimed to have been cut off by another vehicle, but there is no evidence of another vehicle at the scene. V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche) is not primarily responsible for the crash, as the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other: not involved in first harmful event" and the critical reason for the event was not coded to V2. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their decision error and subsequent actions.
