The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1998 Honda CR-V) who was traveling straight in the opposing direction. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's statement that he had a protective green left turn arrow is contradicted by the fact that the left turn arrow is only activated after the southbound lanes have turned red, indicating that V1 should have yielded to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's travel speed make them primarily responsible for the crash.
