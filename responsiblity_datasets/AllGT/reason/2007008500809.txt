The driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by crossing the double yellow line to pass the other vehicles. This action, combined with the slick conditions of the roadway, led to the loss of traction on the black ice. The driver then overcompensated by steering hard right, causing the vehicle to rotate clockwise and ultimately leave the roadway, striking a utility pole. The excessive speed of 137 kmph (85 mph) reported by the police further indicates that V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. Additionally, the driver was not wearing a seat belt, which contributed to their ejection from the vehicle during the rollover.
