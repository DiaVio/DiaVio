The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver stated that the two vehicles in front of him merged quickly to the right, and due to the wet road conditions, he didn't have enough time to stop. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicles in front, which resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 estimated his impact speed to be 48 kmph (30 mph), which suggests that he was traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). This further supports the notion that V1 was not driving with due care and caution, contributing to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and potentially exceeding the speed limit.
