The reason for this is that V1 lost traction on a patch of ice while negotiating a curve and was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions, which was a driver-related factor contributing to the accident. The driver's inexperience with the vehicle and unfamiliarity with the particular roadway also played a role in the accident.
