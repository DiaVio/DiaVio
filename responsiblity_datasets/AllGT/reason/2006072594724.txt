The reason for this is that V1 was entering the roadway from a private driveway and intending to turn left to go eastbound. V2 (the 1993 Ford Aerostar van) was already traveling in the westbound lane when the collision occurred. V1's left turn across the westbound lane would require yielding to oncoming traffic, which V1 failed to do. Although the exact cause of V1's failure to yield is unknown due to a lack of driver interview, it is clear that V1's actions of entering the roadway and turning left without yielding to oncoming traffic contributed to the collision.
