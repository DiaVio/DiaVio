The driver of V1 ran a red light and hit the left side of V2, causing the collision. The driver admitted to being distracted and unfamiliar with the vehicle and roadway. Additionally, he was an inexperienced driver and was not paying attention to the roadway as he was trying to find his friend's house. These factors, along with the illegal maneuver of running the red light, indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
