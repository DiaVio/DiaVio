The reason for V1's responsibility is that she panicked and froze while making a left turn at the intersection. This caused her to proceed in front of V2 (the driver of the Volkswagen Golf) despite the horn blowing from behind. V1's panic and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
