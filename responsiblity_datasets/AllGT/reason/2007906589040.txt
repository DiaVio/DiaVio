The driver of Vehicle 1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included heavy rain, wet roads, and congested traffic flow. This resulted in Vehicle 1 colliding with the back of Vehicle 2, initiating the chain reaction of collisions. The driver of Vehicle 1 lost control due to the weather conditions and their excessive speed, leading to the subsequent impacts with Vehicles 2, 3, and 4.
