The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle that entered the intersection and crossed the path of V1. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V2 was the one who misjudged the gap or the speed of V1. Additionally, V2 stated that they saw V1 about fifty feet away as they crossed the intersection, suggesting that V2 had the opportunity to see and yield to V1 but failed to do so. Therefore, V2's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
