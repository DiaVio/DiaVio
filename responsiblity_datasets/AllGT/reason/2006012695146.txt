The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the intersection, disregarding the stop signs posted on each side of the roadway. V1's driver was disoriented and distracted by looking at road signs, which led to a recognition error and external distraction. This resulted in V1 entering the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. While V2 (the Buick Regal) also had a sightline restriction from shrubbery, it is important to note that V2 was traveling within the speed limit and did not see V1 approaching the intersection. However, V2's lack of awareness or attempt to take any avoidance actions does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to stop at the stop signs. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the intersection and their recognition error caused by external distraction.
