The critical reason for V2 was inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to properly check for oncoming traffic before initiating the left turn. This recognition error led to the collision with V1 (the 1995 Chrysler Lebaron convertible). Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned limited sight distance as an associated factor due to the grade of the roadway, which may have contributed to the failure to see the oncoming vehicle. The use of prescription medications to control high blood pressure was also mentioned as an associated factor for V2.
