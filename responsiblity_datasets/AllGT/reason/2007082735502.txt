The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to going too fast for the road conditions and lost control of her vehicle when transitioning from the asphalt roadway to the metal bridge decking. She also failed to heed the warning sign of a slippery surface ahead and failed to realize that caution was required. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper care and caution while driving, leading to the loss of control and subsequent collision with V2.
