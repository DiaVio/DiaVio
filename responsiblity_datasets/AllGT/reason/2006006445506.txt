The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn onto an intersecting street without yielding to oncoming traffic. This action resulted in V1 colliding with the front left of V2 (the 1998 Dodge Stratus), which was traveling straight in the northbound lane. Additionally, the associated factors coded to V1 driver, such as inadequate surveillance, failure to use a turn signal, and failure to yield to oncoming traffic, further support V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was also described as being totally deaf, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to properly perceive the oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield and make a safe left turn.
