The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it struck the back end of the city bus, indicating that V1 was following too closely or failed to maintain a safe distance from the bus. Additionally, the fact that V1's front end collided with the back end of the bus suggests that V1 may have been traveling at a higher speed than the bus or failed to brake in time to avoid the collision.
