The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection and impacted the front right of V1 (the 2004 Ford Escape). V2's entry into the intersection without yielding or having the right of way suggests that V2 failed to obey traffic laws or failed to notice the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
