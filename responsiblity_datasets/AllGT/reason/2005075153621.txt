The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it experienced a blowout of the right rear tire, which led to a loss of control. This caused V1 to travel partially into lane two and rotate counterclockwise, ultimately resulting in it departing the roadway and rolling over. While the blowout itself may have been unexpected, it is the responsibility of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle in such situations. V1's driver failed to do so, leading to the accident.
