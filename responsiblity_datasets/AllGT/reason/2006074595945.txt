The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; false assumption of other's actions." This indicates that the driver of V2 falsely assumed that V1 would stop prior to the intersection, leading to the collision.
