The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at a row of garages on the left side of the road. This external distraction caused her to take her eyes off the road, resulting in her failure to notice that V2 (the driver of the 2007 Ford Mustang) had stopped in front of her. Additionally, V1 made a false assumption that V2 would continue to proceed, which further contributed to the accident. While V2 was stopped for a few seconds, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as she failed to maintain a safe distance and react in time to avoid the collision.
