The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle after running over a manhole cover that split in half. This caused V1 to jump the c-curb and enter the southbound lanes, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 2001 Chevrolet Astro van) and subsequently striking V3 (the 2000 Dodge Caravan) and V5 (the 1987 Chevrolet Astro van). V1's loss of control and subsequent collision with the other vehicles was directly caused by the manhole cover breaking, which is considered an environment-related factor.
