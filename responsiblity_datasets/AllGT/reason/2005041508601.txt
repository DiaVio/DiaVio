The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 misjudged the speed of V2 (the Dodge Neon) and failed to realize that it was stopped. This misjudgment led to V1 attempting to overtake V2 at the last minute, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there is a strong possibility that the driver of V1 was distracted by using a cell phone at the time of the crash, which could have contributed to her failure to notice the stopped vehicle in front of her. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment of speed and potential distraction.
