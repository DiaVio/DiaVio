The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two made a left turn at the intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver stated that he was stuck in the intersection on a red light and decided to make the left turn when the vehicle ahead of him made the turn. However, the driver did not see Vehicle one approaching, resulting in the collision. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic is the critical reason for the collision and makes Vehicle two primarily responsible.
