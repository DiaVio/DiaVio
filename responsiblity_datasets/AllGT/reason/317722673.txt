The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at a stop sign and began to accelerate from a stop in an attempt to crossover the westbound lanes. V2 (the 2009 Toyota Camry) was traveling in the far left straight lane of the westbound lanes and attempted to pass through the intersection. The front of V2 contacted the left side of V1, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2.
