The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 reportedly fell asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to cross the centerline and depart from the left side of the road. This resulted in the vehicle striking an overhanging tree branch and subsequently impacting two small ornamental yard statues. The driver's falling asleep and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle led to the accident.
