The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn onto the two-lane roadway. This is evident from the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event, which was coded as "Driver Related Factor, Inadequate Surveillance." The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted that he looked but did not see any cars before proceeding to make the left turn. Therefore, the lack of proper surveillance by the driver of Vehicle #1 led to the collision with Vehicle #2. Vehicle #2 (the Chevrolet Lumina) was driving on the road when Vehicle #1 suddenly came out in front of it. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that she tried to avoid the collision by steering, but it was too late. However, since Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and Vehicle #2 had the right of way on the road, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1.
