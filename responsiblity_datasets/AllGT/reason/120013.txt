The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was reportedly confused while attempting to disengage the cruise control system and could not avoid striking V2. Despite attempting to steer right to avoid V2, V1 still ended up colliding with the rear of V2 in an offset manner. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle and was unable to avoid the collision.
