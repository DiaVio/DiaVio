The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention and being distracted by personal thoughts, which caused her to fail to notice that the traffic light was red. Additionally, she assumed that the light would turn green for her, which further demonstrates her lack of attention and awareness. As a result, V1 entered the intersection against a red light and collided with V2 (the 1998 Honda Accord) that was making a left turn with a green arrow. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to obey the traffic signal make her primarily responsible for the accident.
