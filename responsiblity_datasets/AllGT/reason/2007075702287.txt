The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to maintain proper surveillance and did not take correct evasive action. Despite seeing that she couldn't stop in time to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicles in front of her, she changed lanes and applied the brakes but still failed to stop, resulting in the impact with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix) was stopped in the travel lane, waiting to make a left turn, and was impacted from behind by V1. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as another motor vehicle in the lane traveling in the same direction with a higher speed. However, since V1 failed to maintain proper surveillance and take appropriate evasive action, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
