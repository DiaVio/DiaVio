The reason for V1's responsibility is that he admitted to running a red light. He stated that he took his eyes off the roadway to swat an insect in his truck cab, causing him to miss the red light and enter the intersection. This lack of attention and failure to obey the traffic signal resulted in the collision with V2 (the Honda CR-V). Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the red light and his distraction by the insect make him primarily responsible for the accident.
