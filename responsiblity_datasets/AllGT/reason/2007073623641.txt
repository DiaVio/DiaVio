The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly observe the surroundings before making a U-turn, which resulted in the collision with V2. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the crash, as V1's inadequate surveillance caused the encroachment into V2's lane. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to properly observe the traffic and make a safe U-turn.
