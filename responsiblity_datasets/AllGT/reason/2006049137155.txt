The reason for this is that V2 was cited for "inadequate surveillance" as the critical reason for the accident. V2 admitted that he did not see V1 (the driver of the Ford Tempo coupe) until he was entering the intersection. This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
