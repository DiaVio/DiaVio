The driver of V1 entered the intersection against a red light, indicating a failure to obey a traffic control device. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the traffic light and stated that she was not focused on the driving task, indicating inattention. The driver's inadequate surveillance and false assumption also contributed to the accident. The driver's potential fatigue may have further impaired her ability to safely navigate the intersection. V2, on the other hand, had the right of way as indicated by the green light. The driver of V2 stated that he observed the green light and continued at a steady speed. He attempted to avoid V1 by braking and steering right, but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to obey the traffic control device, inattention, inadequate surveillance, false assumption, and potential fatigue.
