The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires the driver to yield to oncoming traffic. V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn, resulting in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 stated that they saw a vehicle to their right, indicating that they were aware of the presence of other vehicles, but they failed to properly assess the situation and ensure that it was safe to proceed with the turn. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
