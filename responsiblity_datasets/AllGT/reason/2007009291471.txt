The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that V2 failed to notice V1 entering the roadway from the driveway and took no evasive actions to avoid the collision. V2's inattention and failure to see V1 blocking his lane of travel contributed to the crash. Additionally, the witness testimony supports the fact that V1 was in the correct lane and attempting a right turn, while V2 was traveling at a high rate of speed in lane two. It is important to note that the witness's hostility and unfounded accusations against the driver of V1 do not provide any substantial evidence to shift the responsibility from V2 to V1. The evidence of the crash and the sequence of events clearly indicate that V2's lack of attention and failure to yield to V1's right of way were the primary factors leading to the accident.
