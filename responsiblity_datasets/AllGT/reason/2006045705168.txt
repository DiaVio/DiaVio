The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and made an unsafe lane change. The driver admitted to being in a hurry, reaching for his cell phone, and not being able to see anyone next to him. This distraction caused V1 to strike the left side of V2 (the 1995 Saab 900S convertible) while attempting to change lanes. V1 then crossed back into its original travel lane and collided with V3 (the 2002 Lexus RX300) in a front-to-front impact. V2's critical pre-crash event was the encroachment of V1 from the adjacent lane over the left lane line. However, no critical reason was coded to V2, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and unsafe lane change, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
