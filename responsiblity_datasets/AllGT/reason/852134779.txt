The reason for this is that V2 was changing lanes into the travel lane of V1, and the left side of V2 impacted the right side of V1. This indicates that V2 was attempting to merge into V1's lane without yielding or properly ensuring that it was safe to do so. This action caused the collision between the two vehicles, leading to the subsequent events and damages.
