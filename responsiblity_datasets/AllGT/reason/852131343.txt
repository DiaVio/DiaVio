The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling in the wrong direction, northbound in the southbound lane. This is a clear violation of traffic laws and poses a significant risk to other vehicles on the road. The impact occurred when V1's front collided with the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2000 Volvo tractor-trailer, which was traveling in the correct direction in lane three. V2's actions were not the cause of the accident, as it was traveling in its designated lane. Additionally, V2's impact forced V1 rearward, indicating that V1 was not able to maintain control or avoid the collision. The fact that V1 was damaged and towed further supports the notion that it was primarily responsible for the accident. It is important to note that the age and condition of the drivers and passengers involved do not directly contribute to the determination of responsibility for the accident. The primary factor is the violation of traffic laws and the actions of the vehicles involved.
