The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control exhibited by the driver. The driver stated that he was drifting across the right edge of the roadway and attempted to correct by applying left-hand steering. However, V1 continued off the right road edge and ultimately collided with the guardrail. This indicates a lack of proper control over the vehicle, leading to the crash. Additionally, an associated factor mentioned in the case summary is fatigue. The driver admitted to having difficulty sleeping and had been driving for several hours prior to the crash. Fatigue can impair a driver's alertness, reaction time, and overall ability to control the vehicle, further contributing to the driver's responsibility for the accident.
