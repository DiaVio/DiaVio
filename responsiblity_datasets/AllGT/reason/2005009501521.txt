The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver's statement that she was upset from an earlier argument with her boyfriend suggests that her emotional state may have affected her ability to focus and properly assess the situation. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling crossing over passing through intersection," indicating that V1 was the vehicle in motion at the time of the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the 1998 Ford E250 Van) stated that he saw the other vehicle but did not anticipate it pulling out into the intersection. While V2 may have had some responsibility to exercise caution, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not adequately surveilling the intersection and failing to yield the right of way to V2.
