The driver of V1 made a decision error by incorrectly taking evasive action to avoid a collision with a phantom vehicle. This evasive maneuver caused V1 to encroach into the travel lane of V2 (the Toyota RAV-4). As a result, V2 was unable to take any avoidance actions and collided with the right rear corner of V1. While V2 was traveling at the posted speed and did not contribute to the crash, the driver of V1's actions were the main cause of the accident.
