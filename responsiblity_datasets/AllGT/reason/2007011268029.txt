The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the Eagle Talon, failed to adequately survey the intersection before initiating the left turn. Despite being stopped at the stop sign for at least 10 seconds and looking both ways, V1 did not see V2 approaching from the left. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness on the part of V1. Additionally, contributing factors such as the driver's inexperience with the intersection at that time of day and being an inexperienced driver overall further support V1's responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, V2, the driver of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle, took appropriate actions by attempting to avoid the collision. He saw V1 pull out and swerved left and braked in an attempt to avoid hitting V1. This indicates that V2 was attentive and reacted in a reasonable manner to the situation. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and a lack of awareness of the approaching vehicle.
