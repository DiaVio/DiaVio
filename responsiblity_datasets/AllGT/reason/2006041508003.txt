The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including speeding, ignoring traffic controls, and driving off the roadway. The driver's decision to engage in these illegal maneuvers, along with other associated factors such as driver inattention and inadequate surveillance, contributed to the collision with V2.
