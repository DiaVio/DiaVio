The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, as witnessed by another motorist who was nearly hit by V1, further supports this conclusion. Additionally, the driver's limited experience and questionable comfort level with the borrowed vehicle may have contributed to the loss of control. While there were roadway-related factors such as wet roads and a dip in the roadway, these factors alone do not absolve the driver of responsibility. It is the driver's responsibility to adjust their speed and driving behavior according to the road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to drive too fast for the conditions and exhibit aggressive driving behavior.
