The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for V2 was "inadequate surveillance." This suggests that V2 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic before making a left turn at the intersection. The driver's inadequate surveillance, possibly due to being distracted after getting directions, led to the collision with V1.
