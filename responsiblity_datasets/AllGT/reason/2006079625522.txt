The reason for this is that Vehicle two was traveling across all lanes towards Vehicle one, resulting in the front of Vehicle two contacting the rear of Vehicle one. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle two claimed that the brakes failed, but the skid marks on the highway contradict this claim. Furthermore, the driver of Vehicle two was not licensed, which indicates a lack of proper qualifications and experience to operate a vehicle. Finally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," and the critical reason was attributed to poor directional control. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's poor control of the vehicle and failure to maintain proper lane position.
