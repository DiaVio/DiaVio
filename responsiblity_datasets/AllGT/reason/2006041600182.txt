The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 made a decision to change lanes in wet and rainy conditions, which were already deemed to be slick. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced, having only had his license for 1 year. These factors, combined with the uneven lanes due to recent re-paving, likely contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the concrete barrier wall.
