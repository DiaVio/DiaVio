The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver of Vehicle #1 edged off the right (east) side of the road as it entered the curve, and then overcorrected, causing the pickup to cross into the southbound lanes and strike the left side of Vehicle #2. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the proper lane. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was reported to be in a hurry and late for an appointment, which may have contributed to her overcompensation and loss of control. The driver's reported stress at work and the fact that she was taking multiple medications for sleep apnea, bipolar disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder could have also affected her ability to safely operate the vehicle. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (the 2003 Kia Rio) attempted to avoid the collision by steering right but was unsuccessful. While the driver of Vehicle #2 was unbelted, it is important to note that the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for causing the initial collision.
