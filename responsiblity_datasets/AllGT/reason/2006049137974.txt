The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to adequately observe the intersection before entering, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1994 Ford F350 pickup). Therefore, V1's failure to properly survey the intersection and ensure it was clear before proceeding makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
