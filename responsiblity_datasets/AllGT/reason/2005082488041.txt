The reason for this is that V1 lost control while negotiating the steep grade and was traveling too fast for the wet conditions. This resulted in V1 crossing over the centerline into the westbound lane and colliding with V2 (the 2002 GMC Yukon). The worn tire deficiency of V1 may have also contributed to the loss of control.
