The reason for this is as follows: - V2 was traveling northbound in lane one and attempting to make a right turn on red. - The witness stated that V2 was accelerating into the intersection in an attempt to make the turn. - V1, traveling east in lane one, entered the intersection and struck the left side front area of V2. - V2 was cited for "Failure to yield right of way" and was traveling too fast, displaying careless and aggressive driving behavior. - V2 was also found to have a suspended license, an unregistered and uninsured vehicle, and was confiscated by the local municipality under the "Live Stop" program. Therefore, based on the witness account, V2's failure to yield right of way, aggressive driving, and other violations make them primarily responsible for the accident.
