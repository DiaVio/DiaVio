The driver of V1 swerved to the left to avoid contact with the parked car's open door, but then lost control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "off the edge of the roadway to the left side" and the critical reason was a performance error, specifically poor directional control due to mistaking the gas pedal for the brake pedal. Although the driver stated that the vehicle was in excellent working condition and he was familiar with it, there were no malfunctions found in the foot controls. This suggests that the driver's mistake in pressing the gas pedal instead of the brakes was the main cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's performance error and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
