The driver of V1 stated that a vehicle suddenly stopped in front of him, causing him to slam on the brakes, steer left, and lose control of his vehicle. However, there is no evidence of a stopped vehicle, and no witnesses or scene evidence to support his claim. Additionally, the police issued the driver a citation for reckless driving/speeding, indicating that his actions were deemed to be the cause of the crash. The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the Critical Reason was coded as incorrect evasive actions. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to take appropriate actions to avoid the collision, leading to the impact with V2 and subsequently V3. Therefore, based on the driver's actions, lack of evidence supporting his claim, and the citation issued by the police, V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash.
