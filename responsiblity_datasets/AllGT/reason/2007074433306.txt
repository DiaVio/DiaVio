The reason for this is that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating that the driver was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver admitted to being distracted and searching for a pack of cigarettes in her purse just prior to the crash. These factors suggest that the driver's inattention and failure to stay within her lane contributed to the collision with V2 (the parked 1995 Dodge Caravan).
