The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to slow down for the traffic in front of them and made a false assumption that the truck in front of them (V2) would pull off onto the shoulder. This false assumption of other's actions led to the collision. Additionally, the observed unusual behavior exhibited by the driver during the interview, such as talking to himself, hand gestures, and constant rocking back and forth, suggests that the driver may have been suffering from an unknown medical condition that could have impaired their judgment and decision-making abilities.
