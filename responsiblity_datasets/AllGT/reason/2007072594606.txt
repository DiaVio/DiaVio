The critical pre-crash event for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. This suggests that V1 attempted to change lanes to the right without properly checking for other vehicles, resulting in the front of V1 striking the left side of V2 (2001 Oldsmobile Bravada). On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 indicates that the encroachment from the adjacent lane (same direction) over the left lane line was caused by another vehicle, not coded to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the initial collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to a driver-related error of changing lanes without proper caution.
