The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the roadway to the right for unknown reasons, possibly due to a preceding medical condition. Despite the driver's attempt to brake, Vehicle 1 still veered slightly right and skidded off the north edge of the road while traveling westbound. This resulted in a collision with a tree, causing the vehicle to rotate and roll onto its top plane. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the roadway ultimately led to the accident.
