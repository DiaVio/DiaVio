The reason for this is that V2 pulled to the right shoulder, made a U-turn, and began traveling northbound in the southbound lane. This action is a violation of traffic laws and poses a significant risk to other vehicles on the road. V1, the 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier sedan, was traveling in its designated lane and attempted to avoid the collision by locking up its brakes and leaving skid marks. However, due to the sudden and unexpected maneuver by V2, the head-on collision occurred.
