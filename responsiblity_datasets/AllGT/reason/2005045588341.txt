The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and attempted to make a right turn without yielding to oncoming traffic. This illegal maneuver caused Vehicle #1 to cross into the southbound lane and collide head-on with Vehicle #2 (the 1998 Pontiac Grand Am). Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver fled the scene of the accident, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility and accountability. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign, failure to yield, and illegal maneuver.
