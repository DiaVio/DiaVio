The reason for this is that V2 lost control and drove left of the centerline, causing it to collide with Vehicle three (V3). This initial impact then caused V2 to continue through and collide with Vehicle one (V1). The subsequent collision between V2 and V1 resulted in significant damage and injuries to the occupants of V1. Additionally, V2's loss of control and crossing into the opposite lane of traffic indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle, which further supports the conclusion that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
