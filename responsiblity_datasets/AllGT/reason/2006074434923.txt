The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle two failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with Vehicle one. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle two stated that she never saw the other vehicle, further supporting the conclusion that she did not properly surveil the intersection before making the left turn. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance while making the left turn.
