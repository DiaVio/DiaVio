The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." Since there is no information available about the driver of V1, it is not possible to determine the specific error made. However, the fact that V1 turned left in front of oncoming traffic suggests a failure to yield the right of way, which is a common driver error in such situations. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their left turn maneuver without yielding to oncoming traffic.
