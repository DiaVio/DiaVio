The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was attempting to cross the arterial road from the private drive on the east side to the private drive on the west side. The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he stopped and waited for traffic from the south to clear before attempting to cross. However, he failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic from the north, specifically Vehicle #2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Corsica) traveling northbound in the left lane. As a result, Vehicle #1 pulled in front of Vehicle #2, causing the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance.
