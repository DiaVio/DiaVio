The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver changed lanes without properly assessing the condition of the vehicle or the road. The driver stated that she felt the vehicle was on a bumpy road and decided to change lanes. However, she did not realize that there was a tire blowout in the left rear tire. Instead of safely pulling over or slowing down, she continued to decelerate while still driving at a high speed of 97 kmph (60 mph). This combination of factors, including the blowout and the sudden change in direction, caused the vehicle to lose control and overturn on the roadway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly assess the vehicle's condition and take appropriate action when faced with a tire blowout.
