The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to a failure to see V1 approaching from the southbound lane. This resulted in the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, the driver of V2 did not take any avoidance actions, further contributing to the accident.
