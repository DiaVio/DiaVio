The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it crossed through multiple lanes, drove over a mountable curb, and ultimately collided with a sign and concrete pole. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their designated lane. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a seatbelt suggests a lack of adherence to safety measures, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
