The driver of V1 stated that he did not realize that V2 was stopped until it was too late. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that he tried to steer to the right to avoid the crash but was unable to do so due to the snow-covered road. This suggests that the driver of V1 may have been driving too fast for the road conditions. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1998 Olds Cutlass) was stopped in the westbound lane ahead of V1, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's lack of attention and misjudgment of the speed of the stopped vehicle ahead.
