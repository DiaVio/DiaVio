V2 was traveling southbound and intended to turn left at the T-intersection. V1, the 2005 Pontiac Vibe SUV, was traveling northbound and swerved right to avoid a collision with V2. This evasive action caused V1 to lose control and ultimately crash into an embankment and a tree. The driver of V1 stated that the unknown vehicle turned left in front of her, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way. Additionally, the critical precrash event for V1 was the encroachment of V2 into the left lane, further supporting V2's responsibility. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and encroachment into the left lane, which forced V1 to take evasive action.
