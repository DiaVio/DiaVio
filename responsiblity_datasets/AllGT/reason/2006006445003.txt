The reason for this is that the evidence at the scene, including the skid marks and the type of damage to the vehicle, indicates that V1 lost control of the vehicle and skidded off the roadway. The skid marks were "yaw" marks created by the front and rear left tires as V1 entered a clockwise spin. The distance between the yaw marks and the type of damage to the vehicle's front right 'A' pillar suggest that the vehicle rolled over to its left side after at least two quarter rolls. Additionally, the driver's claim that she was cut off by another vehicle could not be corroborated due to the lack of an interview or other evidence. The police narrative also stated that the crash events did not occur precisely as described by the driver. Furthermore, the driver had a suspended license and an unknown medical condition, including multiple brain surgeries. It is unknown if these surgeries or related conditions had any adverse effect on the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to overcompensation and a performance error.
