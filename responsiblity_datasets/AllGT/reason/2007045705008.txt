The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted an illegal U-turn immediately after making a right turn onto the arterial road. This illegal maneuver caused V1 to collide with V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Blazer) traveling eastbound in lane 2. The driver of V1 failed to properly check for oncoming traffic, as reported by her father, and did not see V2 approaching. Additionally, V1's driver was a sixteen-year-old inexperienced driver who had not been driving for a full year yet. This lack of experience may have contributed to her failure to properly assess the situation and execute a safe maneuver. While V2's driver was also found to have encroached over the left lane line, the critical reason for this encroachment was not coded to V2. The driver of V2 was taking prescription medication for a thyroid condition and was also under work-related stress. However, these factors do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the illegal U-turn maneuver and the driver's failure to properly check for oncoming traffic.
