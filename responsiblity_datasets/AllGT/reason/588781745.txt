The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted left as it negotiated the right turning curve and partially entered the westbound travel lane, resulting in a small overlap type impact with Vehicle 1 (2012 Toyota Prius v 4-door hatchback). This indicates that Vehicle 2 crossed into the oncoming lane, causing the collision.
