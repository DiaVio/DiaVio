The reason for this is that V1 drove off the roadway on the right side, indicating poor directional control. The presence of alcohol and marijuana use further suggests impairment, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. The driver's refusal to provide an interview and the discovery of alcohol and drug paraphernalia on the driver's seat also raise concerns about the driver's level of intoxication and potential impairment.
