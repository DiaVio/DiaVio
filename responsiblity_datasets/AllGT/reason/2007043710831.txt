The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V1. V1 had the right of way and was traveling at the posted speed limit. V2's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V1 resulted in the collision. Additionally, V2 had vision impairments, including right eye blindness and limited vision in the left eye, which further contributed to the inadequate surveillance. The shadows and sun-glare on the roadway may have also played a role in obstructing V2's vision.
