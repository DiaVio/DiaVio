The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a decision error by taking incorrect evasive action when a dog approached the road from the right. Instead of safely maneuvering around the dog, the driver veered left off the road and into the ditch, ultimately colliding with a culvert, driveways, and a utility pole. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a speed of 71kmph (44mph) five seconds prior to the accident, which was above the posted speed limit of 48kmph (30mph). This indicates that the driver was going too fast for the conditions, which were described as daylight and dry on a weekend morning. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience was also a contributing factor, as she had only been driving for one year. This lack of experience may have influenced her decision-making and ability to handle the situation appropriately. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
