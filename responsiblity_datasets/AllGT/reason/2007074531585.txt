The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that the driver of V2 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including V1, before entering the intersection. As a result, V2 entered the intersection and was struck by V1, leading to the collision.
