The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2 (the 2006 Hyundai Sonata) and was unable to respond to the sudden deceleration of V2. This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event coded for V1, which states that there was another motor vehicle in the same lane traveling in the same direction while decelerating. Additionally, the front right adult passenger of V1 stated that they were only one car length behind V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the actions of other road users makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
