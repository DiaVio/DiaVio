The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the driver-related factor of "inadequate surveillance" mentioned in the report. V1 stated that he proceeded to make the turn after another vehicle traveling north in lane one began making a right turn, but it appears that V1 did not properly assess the situation and failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2.
