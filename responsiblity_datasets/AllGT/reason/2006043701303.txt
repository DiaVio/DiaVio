The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 claimed to have looked but did not see the oncoming V2 (the Toyota Camry sedan) before proceeding through the intersection. This lack of proper surveillance led to V1 crossing the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there were several associated factors that contributed to V1's inadequate surveillance. These factors include the presence of sun glare in the direction of V2, the driver's diabetes and medication, the driver's lack of sleep the previous night, and the possibility of unfamiliarity with the roadway. Overall, V1's failure to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic, combined with the presence of various associated factors, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
