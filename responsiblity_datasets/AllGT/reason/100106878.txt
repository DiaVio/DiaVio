The reason for this is that the driver of V1 became distracted while turning to address the children in the back seat. This distraction caused her to inadvertently turn the steering wheel to the left, resulting in V1 veering across the center turn lane and into the path of V2, the 2004 Chevrolet Silverado pickup. Therefore, the driver of V1's distraction and subsequent actions led to the head-on impact with V2, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
