The driver of V1 admitted to running the stop sign and failing to check for crossing traffic. She also stated that she was confused by the unfamiliar landmarks and was distracted by a phone conversation. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper surveillance and failed to yield the right of way at the intersection. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a lower speed (32 kmph) compared to V2 (72 kmph), suggesting that V1 may not have been able to judge the distance and speed of V2 accurately. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign, inadequate surveillance, and distraction while driving.
