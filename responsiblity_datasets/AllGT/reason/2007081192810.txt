The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the witness stated V1 was drifting back and forth in its lane, indicating poor vehicle control. V1 veered left across multiple lanes, drove up and over curbs, sideswiped a utility pole, and continued traveling on the sidewalk. V1 then struck a conduit tube, veered back onto the roadway, crossed all three lanes, and struck a group of mailboxes. Finally, V1 traveled down an embankment, struck a stair rail, and collided head-on with a large tree. The presence of alcohol in the driver's system, as indicated in the police report, further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
