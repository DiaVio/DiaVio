The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced an epileptic seizure while driving, which impaired her ability to act and control the vehicle. This led to V1 crossing the median, hitting a chain link fence, and ultimately striking a pole. The driver's medical condition and the seizure she experienced are considered driver-related factors that contributed to the accident.
