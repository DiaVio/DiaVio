The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection and the driver reported being unfamiliar with the area, resulting in taking the turn too wide. This caused Vehicle 1 to collide with the front of Vehicle 2 (the 2016 Volvo tractor-trailer). Additionally, Vehicle 1 slowed down to go around a divider median, further contributing to the collision. Therefore, the actions and errors made by the driver of Vehicle 1 led to the accident.
