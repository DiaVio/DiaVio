The reason for this is that V1 was traveling north in the left turn lane and attempted to turn left at the intersection without observing the traffic signal. V1 failed to stop for the red left turn arrow, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by a conversation with the passenger, indicating driver inattention. The driver also mentioned that he blacked out prior to turning left, which further suggests a lack of awareness and control of the vehicle. These factors combined make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
