The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1, whose license was suspended, stated that he did not see the approaching vehicle. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to properly observe and assess the traffic conditions before making a left turn at the intersection. Additionally, the sightline restriction due to an uphill grade for opposing traffic could have contributed to V1's failure to see the approaching vehicle. It is important to note that V2 had the right of way, with a steady green light, and was traveling straight through the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to yield to the right of way of V2 and their inadequate surveillance are the main factors that make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
