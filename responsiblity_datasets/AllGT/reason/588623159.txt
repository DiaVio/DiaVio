The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 changed lanes abruptly to the right in response to the approach of an emergency vehicle, causing the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 (2012 Toyota Camry sedan) to strike the right side plane of Vehicle 2. This lane change by the driver of Vehicle 2 initiated the collision sequence, leading to the subsequent loss of control and further impacts between the two vehicles.
