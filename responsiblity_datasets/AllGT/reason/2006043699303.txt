The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the red light at the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2. The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 80 kmph (50 mph), indicating that V1 was traveling at a high speed and did not have sufficient time to stop when the light turned red. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as an illegal maneuver, as the driver failed to stop for a traffic control device. On the other hand, V2, the driver of the Jeep Liberty, was following the traffic control signal and was preparing to turn left when V1 struck her vehicle. The Critical Reason for V2 was coded as a driver-related error, false assumption of other's actions, as the driver assumed that V1 would yield the right of way. However, V2's estimated travel and impact speeds were only 8 kmph (5 mph), indicating that V2 was traveling at a much slower speed compared to V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop for the red light.
