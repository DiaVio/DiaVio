The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap and distance of Vehicle #2 while making a left turn. The driver claimed she couldn't see Vehicle #2 coming, but later changed her statement to say that Vehicle #2 was coming too fast. Additionally, the driver was distracted by conversing with her passengers and had emotional factors due to attending a funeral. These factors contributed to her misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
