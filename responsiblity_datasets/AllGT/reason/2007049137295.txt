The reason for this is that V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, meaning that the driver failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see V2 approaching. This failure to look and see the oncoming vehicle led to the collision. V2, on the other hand, was not found to have any critical reason or factor that contributed to the accident. The driver of V2 noticed V1 just before entering the intersection and attempted to brake to avoid the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance.
