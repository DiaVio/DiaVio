The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it lost control and crossed the painted median, entering the path of V2. This action caused the front of V2 to strike the right quarter-panel of V1, resulting in the subsequent rotation and collision with the west barrier curb. The sequence of events suggests that V1's initial loss of control and crossing into oncoming traffic initiated the accident.
