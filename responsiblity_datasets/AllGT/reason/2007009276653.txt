The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 misjudged the speed of V2 (the 2006 Freightliner Sprinter) and assumed that he could cross over in time. This misjudgment led to V1 entering the roadway and attempting a left turn in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 had medical conditions including cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes, and hypertension, which may have impaired his judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. The presence of alcohol in V1 and the smell of alcohol on the driver further suggests a potential impairment. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's misjudgment of speed and potential impairment.
