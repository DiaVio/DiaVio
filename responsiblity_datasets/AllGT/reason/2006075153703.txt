The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a blackout episode while driving, which impaired her ability to act and control the vehicle. This is supported by the critical pre-crash event being coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left due to a driver-related critical non-performance error, specifically a blackout. Additionally, the driver's statement about her sight getting fuzzy and her intention to pull over before the crash further confirms her impaired state. While V1's driver may have had underlying medical conditions such as Addison's disease and Fibromyalgia, which could contribute to her blackout episode, it is ultimately her responsibility to ensure that she is fit to drive and take appropriate measures to prevent accidents. The driver's fatigue due to lack of sleep, being ill at the time of the crash, and emotional distress from the family's financial situation are additional factors that may have contributed to her impaired state. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's blackout episode and impaired ability to control the vehicle.
