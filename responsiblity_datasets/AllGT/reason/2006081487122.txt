The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the uncontrolled intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before initiating the turn. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2 prior to turning. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance, where V1 failed to look or looked but did not see V2 approaching from the opposite direction. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) was traveling in the correct lane and attempted to steer right and brake with lock up to avoid the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "Other Motor Encroachment: from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the critical event. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
