The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle # 1 was coded as "Other Vehicle encroaching into lane, from crossing street across path," indicating that Vehicle # 1 failed to yield to Vehicle # 2. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as a recognition error, specifically inadequate surveillance, which is a driver-related error. The associated factors of wet roads and cloudy and raining weather may have contributed to the accident, but the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle # 1 for not properly observing and yielding to Vehicle # 2 at the intersection.
