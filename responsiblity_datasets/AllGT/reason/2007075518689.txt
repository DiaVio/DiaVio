The driver of V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V1. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical event for V2 being coded as "inadequate surveillance." The driver of V2 claimed to have a green arrow at the time of the crash, but this does not absolve them of the responsibility to ensure it is safe to proceed with the left turn.
