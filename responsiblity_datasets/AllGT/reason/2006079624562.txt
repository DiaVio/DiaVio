The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she executed a left turn in front of V2 (the 59-year-old male driver of the 1999 Toyota Camry) without yielding the right of way. V1's confusion upon seeing the ambulance attending the previous collision and her failure to properly assess the situation led to her incorrect decision to turn left when V2 was already entering the intersection. This failure to yield and properly judge the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1's external distraction from the presence of the ambulance, her myopic condition, and the potential fatigue and stress from being a caretaker may have contributed to her inability to properly perceive and react to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to her failure to yield the right of way and execute a safe left turn.
