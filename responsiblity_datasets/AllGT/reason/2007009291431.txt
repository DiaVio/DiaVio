The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a sudden gas pain in his abdomen, which caused him to brake and steer right onto the shoulder. This action resulted in V1 veering off the road and colliding with a signpost and a telephone pole. The driver passed out during the incident, indicating a physical impairment that prevented him from safely operating the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's physical impairment and subsequent loss of control.
