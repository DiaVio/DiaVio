The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which led to her vehicle departing the roadway and colliding with a power pole. The driver's fatigue and lack of sleep, combined with her doctor's belief that she may have sleep apnea, indicate that she was not in a proper condition to be operating a vehicle safely. Falling asleep at the wheel is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of traffic laws.
