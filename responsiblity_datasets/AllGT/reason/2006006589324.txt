The reason for this is that V2 was making an illegal left turn at the intersection, despite there being a posted overhead sign indicating "no turns." V2 admitted to not seeing the sign and was in a hurry to get to a social appointment, which may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and failure to notice V1 approaching the intersection. Additionally, V2's possible distraction from conversing with her passenger further supports her responsibility for the accident.
