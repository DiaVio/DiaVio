The reason for this is that V2 was driving under the influence of alcohol, with a BAC of .187, which is significantly above the legal limit. This impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely and contributed to the collision. Additionally, V2 attempted to flee the scene, indicating a disregard for the law and responsibility. While V1 was cited for driving with a suspended and expired license, and for failure to yield, the primary responsibility lies with V2 due to the driver's intoxication and attempt to flee the scene.
