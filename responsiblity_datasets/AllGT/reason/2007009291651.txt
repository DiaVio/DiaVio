The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling at a reported high rate of speed and entered the intersection without stopping. V1 failed to yield the right-of-way to V2 (the Ford Focus sedan) which was already in the intersection and had the right to proceed. Additionally, V1 left the scene of the accident at a high rate of speed, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. V2, on the other hand, was following the proper procedure by treating the intersection as a 4-way stop due to the non-functioning traffic signal. The driver of V2 stated that it was their turn to proceed, and they did not see V1 approaching from their right until the crash occurred. While the driver of V2 was found to have the smell of beer on them, it is important to note that this does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their excessive speed, failure to stop at the intersection, and leaving the scene. V2, although potentially impaired, was following the correct procedure and did not have the opportunity to avoid the collision.
