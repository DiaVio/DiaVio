The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in lane one of a two-lane, two-way roadway and failed to maintain control of the vehicle. V1 crossed through the intersection, impacted the curb, and ultimately collided with a large tree. The driver of V1 sustained severe injuries, indicating that they were unable to properly control the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that the front right passenger of V1 was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt suggests a lack of responsibility and compliance with safety measures, which could have contributed to the severity of their injuries. It is important to note that the investigation may reveal additional factors that could impact the determination of responsibility.
