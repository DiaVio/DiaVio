The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to not realizing that V2 had stopped in front of them. They were looking to the left for traffic and did not notice V2 in time to stop. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that they slid on the wet roadway when they applied the brakes. While the wet conditions may have contributed to the accident, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior to the conditions of the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to notice and react to the stopped vehicle in front of them.
