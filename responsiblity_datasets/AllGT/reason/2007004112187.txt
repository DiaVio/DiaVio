The reason for this is that V1, the Chevrolet Cavalier, was making a left turn in front of V2, the Buick LeSabre, without yielding the right of way. V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and did not see V2 approaching the intersection. V2 had the right of way and was traveling at a constant speed with a green light. Despite V2's attempt to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, V1 turned left in front of V2, resulting in the collision.
