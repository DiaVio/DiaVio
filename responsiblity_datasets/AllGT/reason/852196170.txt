The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to rotate clockwise and ultimately collide with two poles. The driver's loss of control suggests a lack of proper vehicle handling or control, which led to the accident. Additionally, the fact that V1 crossed over into another lane and departed the roadway indicates a failure to maintain proper lane position and control of the vehicle.
