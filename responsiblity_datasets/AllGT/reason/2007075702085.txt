The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver became distracted by looking at a sign on the northeast corner of the intersection. This distraction caused V1 to veer slightly to the left, driving onto the brick median and colliding with two signs. The driver admitted to being distracted by looking at the price of gas and stated that she hit the median curb before she knew it. This distraction and subsequent loss of control led to the crash. Additionally, the driver's health conditions and the medications she takes may have contributed to her ability to safely operate the vehicle. While there is no mention of impairment in vision or hearing, the combination of serious health conditions and multiple medications could potentially affect her cognitive abilities and reaction times. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and subsequent loss of control.
