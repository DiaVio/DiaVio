The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver's actions of going off the road towards the right and striking a tree. This indicates a loss of control of the vehicle, which can be attributed to the driver's medical conditions and history. The driver's history of sickle cell disease, stroke, gallbladder removal, port-a-cath, and seizures, along with the reported transient loss of consciousness, suggest that the driver's medical condition may have played a role in the crash. Additionally, the wet road conditions due to heavy rain could have further contributed to the loss of control. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and medical condition, as well as the influence of wet road conditions.
