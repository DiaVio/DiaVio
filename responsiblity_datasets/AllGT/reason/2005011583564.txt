The driver of V1 was turning left out of a private driveway onto a rural roadway. The critical reason for the pre-crash event was inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver did not see the oncoming V2 (the 1999 Dodge Durango SUV). Factors such as sun glare, a mailbox, and the crest of a hill may have contributed to the driver's inability to properly see the approaching vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned being small in stature, which could have further limited her visibility from the lower position in the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately survey the roadway before making the left turn.
