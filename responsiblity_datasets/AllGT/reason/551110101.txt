The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted a left turn onto the highway without yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, the 1998 Kenworth tractor semi-truck, was traveling through the intersection at the speed limit and attempted to swerve left to avoid V1. However, V1's failure to yield resulted in multiple impacts with V2, causing significant damage to both vehicles and leading to the driver of V1 being transported to the trauma center.
