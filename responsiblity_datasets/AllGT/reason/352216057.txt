The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway and entered the painted parking area adjacent to the roadway, ultimately colliding with and underriding the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 (the Peterbilt tractor). This indicates that Vehicle 1 was not maintaining proper control and failed to stay within the designated travel lane, resulting in the collision.
