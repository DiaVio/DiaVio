The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he couldn't understand why Vehicle #2 stopped a second time and assumed she would continue to turn right. This indicates a false assumption of the other driver's actions, which was the critical reason for the crash according to the driver's statement. The critical precrash event for Vehicle #1 was also coded as a driver-related decision error. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (1996 Volkswagen Jetta) was stopped at a red light and slowed down to allow approaching traffic to pass before proceeding. The critical precrash event for Vehicle #2 was coded as another vehicle traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, indicating that Vehicle #2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's false assumption of the other driver's actions.
