The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed into the curve, which was too fast for the conditions. The driver lost control of the vehicle and drifted into the center turn lane. When attempting to steer back into the original lane, the tires lost traction in the loose sand, causing the vehicle to continue into the oncoming lane and collide with V2 (the 2005 Toyota Corolla sedan). Additionally, associative factors for V1 include speeding, loose sand and gravel on the roadway, and under-inflated tires. These factors further contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
