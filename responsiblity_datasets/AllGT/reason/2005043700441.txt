The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that V2 changed lanes to the left in front of V1, resulting in a collision. This action of changing lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so constitutes a driving error on the part of V2. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V2's travel and impact speeds to be lower than V1's, indicating that V2 may have been driving at a slower speed and failed to yield to V1. It is also worth noting that V2 was reported to have been driving erratically, slowing down as if to turn right and then re-accelerating. This erratic behavior could have contributed to the unsafe lane change and the subsequent collision. Overall, V2's failure to safely change lanes and the erratic driving behavior make them primarily responsible for the accident.
