The reason for this is that V1, the Ford Fusion, crossed into the westbound lane and struck a parked vehicle, causing a chain reaction with the other parked vehicles. This indicates that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the mention of the driver being in a non-optimal posture due to a syncopal episode suggests that the driver may have been incapacitated or impaired, further contributing to their responsibility in the accident.
