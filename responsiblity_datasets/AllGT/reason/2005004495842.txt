The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to having degraded braking capability, which was a vehicle-related factor. Additionally, the driver was fatigued, taking medications, and distracted by conversing with the passenger. These factors contributed to poor driver performance, including poor directional control. The driver of V1 failed to take any avoidance actions, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2005 Ford Focus hatchback) and subsequently pushing V2 into V3 (the 2002 Chevy Express Van).
