The reason for this is that V1 was reported to have driven through a red light, disregarding the traffic signal at the intersection. Additionally, the police accident report stated that the driver of V1 appeared intoxicated and was charged with DUI. These factors indicate that V1 was engaging in an illegal maneuver and was not following the rules of the road, making them primarily responsible for the collision.
