The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle two made an illegal maneuver by attempting to make a U-turn in the middle of a busy major roadway. This action violated traffic laws and put the driver at risk of colliding with oncoming traffic. Despite being familiar with the area, the driver failed to observe the car traveling north in lane one and was struck on the right side. While the driver of vehicle one (the 1987 Pontiac Grand AM) attempted to steer to the right to avoid the collision, it was too late to prevent the accident. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of vehicle two for making an illegal U-turn and failing to yield to oncoming traffic.
