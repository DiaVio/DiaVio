The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he thought his brakes and steering wheel locked up, causing him to panic and steer off the roadway to the right. However, both the police and the researcher tested the brakes and steering at the scene and found no evidence of a malfunction. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle #1 was inexperienced and not familiar with a loss of power steering. This lack of experience and familiarity may have contributed to his panic and inability to properly control the vehicle during the incident. Therefore, based on the driver's panic and freezing response, as well as the lack of evidence supporting a mechanical failure, Vehicle #1 (Chevrolet Malibu) is primarily responsible for the crash.
