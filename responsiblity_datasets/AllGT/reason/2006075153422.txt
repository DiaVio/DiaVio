The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was turning left at an intersection and failed to adequately assess the situation before making the turn. The driver stated that he did not see Vehicle two due to a stopped heavy truck in lane three, which obstructed his view. However, it is the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to do so before proceeding. In this case, the driver of Vehicle one failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic and did not take appropriate avoidance maneuvers. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two (the 2000 Honda Civic) was going straight and had the right of way. Although he stated that he hit his brakes, he was unable to avoid the collision with Vehicle one. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to turn with an obstructed view and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
