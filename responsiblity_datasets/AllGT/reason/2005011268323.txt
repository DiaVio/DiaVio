The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a decision error/illegal maneuver by deciding to go through the intersection when the light turned yellow. This decision was made while the driver was distracted, as she leaned down to pick up a container of decongestant medicine, taking her eyes off the road and the traffic signal. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a sight line restriction due to large vehicles blocking her view of V2 until just prior to impact. Furthermore, the driver of V1 had other contributing factors such as fatigue from working long hours and taking care of young children, as well as health conditions and medication use that could have potentially affected her ability to drive safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the decision error, distraction, and other contributing factors that led to the collision.
