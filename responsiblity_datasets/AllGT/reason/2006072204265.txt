The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 incorrectly assumed that the cross traffic would stop for the red traffic control signal. When the non-contact vehicle entered the intersection against the red light, the driver of V1 correctly steered to the left to avoid the vehicle. However, the driver failed to apply the brakes to avoid the impact with the bridge pillar, resulting in the crash.
