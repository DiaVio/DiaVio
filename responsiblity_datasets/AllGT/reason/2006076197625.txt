The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper directional control. This is evident from the fact that V1 departed the road on the right, struck the guardrail, crossed both lanes of travel, and then departed the road on the left side. The driver's statement about the brakes feeling "funny" and the possibility of a tire blowout does not align with the lack of evidence for a blowout and the fact that the vehicle was in excellent condition. Additionally, the driver's limited understanding of English and potential fatigue from driving 85 miles may have contributed to her poor directional control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factor of poor directional control.
