The reason for this is that V1 was exiting a private driveway and intending to turn left onto the highway. The driver of V1 stated that she had stopped to wait for traffic, looked in both directions, and did not see V2 (the 2005 GMC full-size pickup) until just before the crash occurred. This indicates that V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before entering, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V2 was traveling straight in the number two lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that he noticed V1 looking to the right, away from him, but assumed that she had seen him and was waiting for him to pass before entering the road. This suggests that V2 was not at fault and was taken by surprise when V1 turned left in front of him. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while entering the roadway from a driveway.
