The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the road, which included a dirt roadway with potholes and a hillcrest. This is evident from the driver's statement that she was trying to avoid the potholes and lost control of the vehicle as a result. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and poor directional control further contribute to her responsibility for the crash.
