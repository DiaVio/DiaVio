The driver of V1 stated that she was traveling slightly under the speed limit when her vehicle hit a patch of standing water. This caused her vehicle to fishtail and lose control, ultimately resulting in the crash. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle in wet conditions suggests a lack of caution and attentiveness while driving. Additionally, the associative factors of minimal tire tread and very low tire pressure indicate that the vehicle may not have been properly maintained, further contributing to the loss of control. While the poor road conditions, specifically the standing water on the roadway, were a contributing factor to the crash, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and take necessary precautions when encountering such conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and adapt to the wet road conditions.
