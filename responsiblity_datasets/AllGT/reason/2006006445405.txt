The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for its red light and entered the intersection illegally. The witness traveling behind V2 confirmed that V2 was driving as if she was trying to time the lights correctly and entered the intersection after the light had turned red. Additionally, V2 was traveling too fast for conditions, trying to keep up with traffic and time the lights. These actions by the driver of V2 directly led to the collision with V1.
