The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 encroached into V2's travel lane, causing the collision. The driver of V1 admitted to attempting to change lanes to the right without adequately checking to the right front of his vehicle before moving over. This indicates a driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, V2 may have been in V1's blind spot, further contributing to the driver's failure to notice the other vehicle before impact. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly change lanes and ensure the safety of other vehicles on the road.
