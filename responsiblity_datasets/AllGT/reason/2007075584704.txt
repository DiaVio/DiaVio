The driver of V1 made a poor decision to pull over to the right as far as possible to give the snowplow more room, which resulted in the right rear tire getting caught between the edge of the road and the snow piled on the roadside. This poor directional control caused V1 to rotate off the road and roll over multiple times. The driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected in this situation led to the accident.
