The reason for this is that V1 was driving in the wrong direction (westbound in the eastbound lanes) for unknown reasons. This caused V1 to collide with Vehicle 2 (V2) and Vehicle 3 (V3) as they were making left turns onto the intersecting roadway. The impact between V1 and V2 resulted in V2 rotating counterclockwise and eventually colliding with a street sign post. V1 then continued traveling and collided with the front of Vehicle 4 (V4), which was stopped for a traffic light, and subsequently pushed V4 into the front of Vehicle 5 (V5). Therefore, V1's actions of driving in the wrong direction and causing multiple collisions make it primarily responsible for the accident.
