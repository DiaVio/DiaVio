The driver of V1 was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V2 and failed to maintain a safe following distance. When V2 slowed down behind the non-contact vehicle, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2. This initial impact caused V2 to veer out of control and cross into the path of V3, resulting in a second collision. The driver of V1 claimed to be distracted by the actions of the non-contact vehicle, but it is the responsibility of every driver to maintain control of their vehicle and adjust their speed accordingly to avoid collisions. The driver of V1 failed to do so, leading to the chain of events that caused the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to stop in time to avoid colliding with V2.
