The reason for this is that V2 was traveling behind V1 and failed to maintain a safe distance or react in time to avoid the collision when V1 stopped to make a left turn at the intersection. V2's frontal plane impacted the rear plane of V1, indicating that V2 was following too closely and did not have enough time or space to stop or maneuver safely.
