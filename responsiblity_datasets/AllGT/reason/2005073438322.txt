The driver of V1 entered the intersection on a red light while attempting a left turn. This action violated traffic laws and resulted in the collision with V2. The driver's claim of a "big truck" blocking her view of the traffic signals does not absolve her of responsibility, as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure the intersection is clear before proceeding. Additionally, the witness behind V1 confirmed that the light for westbound traffic had turned red before the collision occurred. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to obey traffic signals make them primarily responsible for the accident.
