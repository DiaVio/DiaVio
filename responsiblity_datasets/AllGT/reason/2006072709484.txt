The reason for this is that V1 drove off the left side of the road and crashed into a building. The driver's poor directional control and sudden departure from the roadway indicate a lack of proper vehicle handling and control. Although the exact reason for this behavior could not be determined, it is clear that V1's actions led to the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver fled the scene further suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability.
