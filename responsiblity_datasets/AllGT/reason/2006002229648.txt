The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 admitted to not seeing Vehicle #1 in his lane and stated that he was not giving full attention to his driving due to thinking about forms for his home inspection business. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 mentioned taking medication for a heart condition and high cholesterol, which could have side effects such as light-headedness, dizziness, and blurred vision. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle #2 was not fully focused on the road and failed to look properly, resulting in the rear-end collision with Vehicle #1.
