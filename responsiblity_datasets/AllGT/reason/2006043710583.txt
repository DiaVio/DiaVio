The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not look far enough ahead. This is evident from the fact that the driver was focused on following the car in front of him and did not notice the stopped box truck in his lane until it was too late. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the wet roads, downhill grade, and foggy conditions, which further contributed to the inability to stop in time and avoid the collision. The driver's lack of familiarity with the roadway and the morning rush hour congestion also played a role in the accident.
