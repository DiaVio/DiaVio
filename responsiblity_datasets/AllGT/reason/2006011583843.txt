The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. Despite the light turning yellow, V1 proceeded into the intersection without ensuring that it was clear. This lack of surveillance and failure to see the oncoming V2 (the 1995 Ford Probe) resulted in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was unfamiliar with the vehicle he was driving, which may have contributed to his inability to properly assess the situation.
