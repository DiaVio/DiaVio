The reason for this is that V1 was making a right turn from the east, and failed to properly assess the traffic in lane one before initiating the turn. V1 falsely assumed that lane one was clear, leading to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2003 Ford Taurus) who was traveling in lane one. V1's false assumption of other users' actions and distraction from forgetting something at the office contributed to the critical event. While V2 was involved in a lane change from lane one to lane two and back to lane one, this action was in response to passing slower moving traffic and was not the primary cause of the crash. V2's distraction from thinking about upcoming events may have contributed to the critical event, but V1's failure to yield the right of way was the main factor leading to the collision.
