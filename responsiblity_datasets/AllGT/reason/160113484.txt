The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign, waiting to turn left, and then proceeded to turn left into the path of Vehicle 2 (V2). V2 was traveling in the southbound right through lane and had the right of way. V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and turning into the path of V2 resulted in the collision.
