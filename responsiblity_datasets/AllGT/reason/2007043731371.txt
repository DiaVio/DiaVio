The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to stop and struck the back of V2. V1 admitted to not braking when approaching the intersection, assuming that V2 would continue to proceed. This false assumption of V1's actions led to insufficient braking inputs, causing them to slide for a long time and ultimately collide with the back of V2.
