The driver of V2 stated that he recognized the other vehicle approaching from east to west when he was only a few meters from the intersection. He claimed that the other car suddenly accelerated into the intersection, leaving him with no time to respond. However, the physical evidence, damage patterns, and post-crash trajectories of the two vehicles did not support this claim. Additionally, witnesses gave conflicting stories to the police. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is likely that V2 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and entered the intersection, causing the collision with V1.
