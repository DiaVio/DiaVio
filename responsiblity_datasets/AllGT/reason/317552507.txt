The driver of V1 drifted onto the right roadside, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. This action led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and subsequently crossing the center lane line. The driver's attempt to steer back onto the roadway resulted in a clockwise yaw and skidding off the roadway to the left. These actions ultimately led to V1 colliding with multiple trees and sustaining disabling damage. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane.
