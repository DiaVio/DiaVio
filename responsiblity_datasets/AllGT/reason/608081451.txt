The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with the concrete traffic barrier. This loss of control and subsequent impact caused the vehicle to flip over and roll four-quarter turns before coming to rest on the roadside. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the roadway is the main contributing factor to the accident.
