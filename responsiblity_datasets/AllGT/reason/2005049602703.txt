The reason for this is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which led to him losing control of the vehicle and driving off the road to the left. The fact that he was working long hours at night and only getting four to five hours of sleep during the day suggests that driver fatigue played a significant role in the crash. Falling asleep while driving is a clear violation of traffic laws and is a dangerous behavior that can lead to accidents.
