The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1991 Buick Century) who was already in the intersection. V1 falsely assumed that V2 had a stop sign, which led to their decision to enter the intersection without properly assessing the situation. Additionally, V1 failed to look to either side ahead, indicating a lack of attentiveness and awareness of their surroundings. While V2 did mention being fatigued and skidding while attempting to brake, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for their failure to yield and false assumption of the other driver's actions.
