The driver of V1 misjudged the speed and gap distance of the vehicle ahead, which was stopped due to the congested traffic. The driver of V1 applied the brakes but was unable to stop in time, resulting in a collision with the rear of V2 (the 2000 Volvo V70 Station wagon). The driver of V1 was also impaired by alcohol, which affected their reasoning ability and reaction time, contributing to the crash.
