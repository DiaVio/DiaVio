The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to look left before attempting to change lanes. This lack of proper surveillance led to her not noticing the vehicle in the lane to her left, resulting in her overcorrecting and driving off the right side of the roadway. Additionally, the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle after realizing there was a vehicle in the adjacent lane contributed to the crash. While there was a mention of a witness reporting a blown-out tire, the inspection of the tire did not substantiate this claim. Therefore, the primary reason for the crash was determined to be the driver's failure to properly observe her surroundings and make a safe lane change, rather than a tire/wheel failure.
