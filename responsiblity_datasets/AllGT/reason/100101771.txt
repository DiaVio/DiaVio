The driver of V1 failed to negotiate the left curve in the road and drove off the right side of the roadway. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, the driver made a steering input/correction to the left in an attempt to regain the roadway, but this resulted in a counterclockwise yaw and further loss of control. The vehicle ultimately tripped and overturned multiple times before coming to rest in a field. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for their failure to navigate the curve and maintain control of the vehicle.
