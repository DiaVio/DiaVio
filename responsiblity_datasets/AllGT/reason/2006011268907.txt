The driver of V1 stated that she activated her left blinker and slowed down to look for her niece's home on the left-hand side. However, she failed to adequately surveil the road before making her left turn. She did not initially see V2 approaching from the opposite direction and only noticed it when it was too late to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1's inadequate surveillance was the critical reason for the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by personal concerns, as it was her first holiday season since the death of her husband. These factors contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
