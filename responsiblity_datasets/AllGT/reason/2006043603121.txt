The reason for V1's responsibility is the physical impairment of the driver's ability to act due to her blackout. The driver, a 31-year-old female, suffers from panic attacks, seizures, and migraine headaches. She has experienced two seizures in the past two years and had a continuous headache on the day of the accident. Additionally, she is stressed from an ongoing divorce and recently turned over property rights to her husband. She is on long-term medical disability and has not worked in six months. During the trip, the driver blacked out and drove off the road, only regaining consciousness when her daughter woke her up as they were headed toward a creek. She was in shock and did not attempt to stop the vehicle, resulting in it driving straight into the creek. The Critical Precrash Event was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side," and the Critical Reason was coded as "physical impairment of the ability to act" due to the driver's blackout. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's physical impairment and inability to control the vehicle.
