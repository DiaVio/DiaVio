The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control of the vehicle and overcompensated his steering, resulting in the vehicle going off the roadway and impacting a utility pole. The driver stated that he felt the back end of his vehicle hydroplaning, indicating that he was likely traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was coded as "loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions," further supporting the conclusion that the driver of Vehicle #1 was primarily responsible for the crash.
