The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were distracted by reaching for their cell phone, which caused them to not notice the car stopped in front of them (V2, the Chevy Cavalier). This distraction led to V1 rear-ending V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the front tire on V1's car was bald, which could have extended their stopping distance. This further contributes to V1's responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving and failure to maintain a safe stopping distance.
