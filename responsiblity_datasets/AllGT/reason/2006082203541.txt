The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle attempting to change lanes. This resulted in V1 skidding off the right side of the roadway and colliding with V2 (the parked and unoccupied 1986 Toyota pickup).
