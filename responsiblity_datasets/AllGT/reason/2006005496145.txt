The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver had a BAC of .178, indicating alcohol use, which impaired their ability to operate the vehicle safely. The driver also reported being unfamiliar with both the vehicle and the roadway, further contributing to their inability to navigate the intersection properly. These factors, including the illegal maneuver, alcohol use, and inadequate surveillance, all point to V1 as the primarily responsible party in this accident.
