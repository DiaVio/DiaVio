The reason for this is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the curve on the off-ramp. The driver stated that he had reduced his speed to approximately 72 kmph (45 mph), but it was reasoned that he was actually traveling faster than he thought. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle, led to a loss of control and the subsequent crash. Additionally, the driver's statement that he was not in a hurry contradicted his claim that he was 45 minutes late for a soccer game. This suggests that he may have been rushing and not paying enough attention to the road and the curve ahead. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the curve and exhibiting poor directional control of the vehicle.
