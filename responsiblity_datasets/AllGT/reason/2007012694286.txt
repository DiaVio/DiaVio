The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to observe the traffic control device. Despite the traffic light blinking red, V1 did not come to a complete stop before accelerating into the intersection. This indicates a recognition error and internal distraction on the part of the driver. Additionally, V1 made a false assumption that V2 (the 1999 Ford Taurus) would stop, leading to the collision. The driver's use of prescription medications and the wet roadway may have also contributed to the driver's failure to properly observe and react to the situation.
