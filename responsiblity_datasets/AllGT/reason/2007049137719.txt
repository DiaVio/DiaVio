The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right-of-way to V1, who had the green light and was already in the intersection. V2 admitted that he did not realize V1 was not going to yield until just before entering the intersection, indicating a lack of proper surveillance and failure to look to his left. This failure to observe and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision.
