The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The speed limit on the ramp was 113 kmph (70mph), but there was an advisory speed of 64kmph (40mph) due to the wet road conditions. Additionally, the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the right curve of the ramp, indicating that they were not able to handle the curve at the speed they were traveling. The low tread depth of the rear tires may have also contributed to the loss of control. V2 (the 2000 Jeep Cherokee) is not primarily responsible for the crash. Although V2 was involved in the collision, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the initial loss of control by V1. The driver of V2 stated that she never saw the other vehicle coming until it was too late and did everything she could to keep her vehicle under control.
