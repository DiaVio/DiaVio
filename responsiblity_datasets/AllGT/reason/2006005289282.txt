The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep while driving, which caused the vehicle to drift off the roadway and ultimately collide with a utility pole. The driver's fatigue and lack of attention to the road were the critical factors leading to the crash. Additionally, the driver's change in sleep patterns, physical exertion, and not wearing prescription lenses that correct his far-sighted condition may have further contributed to his inability to stay alert while driving.
