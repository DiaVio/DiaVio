The driver of V1, who was in a diabetic coma, crossed the middle line into oncoming traffic, causing the collision with V2. This action by the driver of V1 initiated the chain of events that led to the subsequent collision with V3. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay in the correct lane is the main reason for the accident.
