The reason for this is that V2 was following too closely to V1 and failed to maintain a safe distance. V2's driver assumed that V1 would not stop abruptly, which led to the collision. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the double-parked truck may have contributed to the driver's inability to react in time. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and making a false assumption about the actions of the other road user (V1).
