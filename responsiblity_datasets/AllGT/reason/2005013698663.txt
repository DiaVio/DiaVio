The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 stopped right away and stated that she must have been daydreaming. This indicates a recognition error and inattention on the part of the driver of V1. The driver's admission of steering to the right at the last second but still being unable to avoid the crash further supports their responsibility. On the other hand, V2 (the 2002 Dodge Caravan) was stopped for a red light and there were no associated factors coded to suggest any contribution to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them.
