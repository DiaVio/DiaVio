The driver of V1 was attempting to elude immigration officers, which led to aggressive driving behavior, including speeding and failing to stop for a stop sign. As a result, V1 crossed into the oncoming lane of traffic, impacting V2 (the 1991 Ford Ranger pickup) on its left side. Therefore, V1's actions of attempting to avoid being stopped and driving aggressively ultimately caused the crash.
