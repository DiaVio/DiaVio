The reason for this is that V2 was southbound on a two-lane street with a stop sign at the intersection. V2 attempted to turn left without yielding the right of way to V1, which was eastbound on the same street. This failure to yield resulted in the front of V2 impacting the left side of V1 in the intersection, causing the crash.
