The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a u-turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, causing the collision with Vehicle 2. The driver of Vehicle 2 attempted to brake and steer to avoid the collision, but was unable to do so. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 1 for failing to yield and causing the collision.
