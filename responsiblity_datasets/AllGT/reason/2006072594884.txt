The reason for this is that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, which indicates that they were not maintaining their lane properly. This driver-related error contributed to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Impala) when V1 attempted to change lanes into the third travel lane. It is important to note that V2 was also involved in a critical pre-crash event, where they encroached into the left lane from the adjacent lane. However, this event was not attributed as the critical reason for the crash and was not coded to V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1.
