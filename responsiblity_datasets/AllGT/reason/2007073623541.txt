The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at an intersection and had an obstructed view. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 until just before the crash. This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, which resulted in the collision with V2. While V2 was encroaching over the left lane line, the critical reason for this pre-crash event was not coded to V2. Therefore, it can be inferred that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to turning left with an obstructed view and failing to see V2 before the collision occurred.
