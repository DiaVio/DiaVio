The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla). The driver of V1 assumed that V2 would proceed through the yellow light or turn onto the on ramp, but V2 actually decided to stop at the intersection before turning right onto the northbound ramp. As a result, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to maintain a safe following distance are the main factors contributing to the accident.
