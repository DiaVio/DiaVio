The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to maintain proper attention and control of their vehicle while attempting to change lanes. V1 was distracted by talking to their passenger and did not notice that V2 (the driver of the 2002 Ford Taurus sedan) had stopped for a red light. As a result, V1's vehicle collided with the rear of V2's vehicle. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to observe the stopped vehicle ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
