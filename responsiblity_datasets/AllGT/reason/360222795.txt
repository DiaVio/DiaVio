The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection while Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2008 Toyota Tundra large pickup, was crossing straight through the intersection. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the front of V2 impacting the front of V1. This indicates that V1 violated the traffic rules by not giving way to oncoming traffic, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
