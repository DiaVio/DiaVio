The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize the traffic control device (the red light) and V2's presence in the intersection. The witness stated that V1 entered the intersection without taking any avoidance actions, indicating a lack of awareness or attention to the traffic signal. Additionally, V1's inexperience as a young driver and the fact that they were making an illegal maneuver (traveling in lane three instead of the designated lanes) further contribute to their responsibility for the accident.
