The reason for this is that V1's driver, a 20-year-old male, changed lanes to pass slower vehicles and then overcorrected while returning to lane one. This action caused V1 to depart from the roadway to the right and ultimately roll onto its roof. Additionally, the critical precrash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for this event was identified as a driver-related factor, specifically internal distraction. The driver and the 16-year-old female passenger were having an argument and wrestling, which contributed to the driver's inattention and ultimately led to the crash.
