The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, despite having a stop sign. The driver was occupied with talking to his wife and using a GPS system, which distracted him from properly observing the road. - The driver of V1 claimed that fog and rain prevented him from seeing V2 (Ford Explorer), but it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure safe visibility and adjust their driving accordingly in adverse weather conditions. - Additionally, the tread depth of V1's tires was inadequate, which could have contributed to reduced traction and control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, distraction, and failure to adapt to the weather conditions.
