The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 107 kph (68 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 105 kph (65 mph). Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the road, as it was his first time driving on it. These factors, combined with the wet road conditions and the left-hand curve, contributed to the driver losing control of the vehicle and ultimately causing the accident.
