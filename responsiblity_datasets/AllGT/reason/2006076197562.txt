The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 gradually crossed the southbound fog line to the right, contacted the rumble strip, and then steered left, indicating a deviation from the intended path of travel. - V1 rotated counter-clockwise as it crossed both travel lanes to the left, suggesting a loss of control. - V1 departed the road edge and contacted a series of small bushes in the dirt median before colliding with a large mesquite tree, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. - The driver of V1 was found to be extremely hyper-glycemic with a glucose level of 336, which may have impaired their ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver of V1 may have also experienced an alcoholic withdrawal seizure, as indicated by the presence of the prescription drug "Zoloft" consistent with an alcoholic withdrawal program. - The high ETOH level of .329 further suggests impairment due to alcohol consumption. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that V1's driver, who refused to be interviewed, was likely experiencing medical issues and impairment from both hyper-glycemia and alcohol withdrawal, which contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
