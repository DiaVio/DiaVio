The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop in time and collided with the back of V2. V1's driver was distracted by looking at a turning vehicle in the right lane, which is considered an external distraction. Additionally, V1's driver was inexperienced and did not have a valid driver's license. These factors, combined with the bald tires on V1, likely contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time and avoid the collision.
