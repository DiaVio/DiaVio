The driver of V1 made the decision to pull back out into traffic from the left paved shoulder without properly assessing the speed and distance of oncoming vehicles. This action resulted in V1 entering lane five of the northbound traffic lanes and being hit by V2 (the driver of the Honda Civic) who was driving along straight in that lane. Although V2 was traveling at the speed limit in the HOV lane, the wet road conditions made it difficult for V2 to stop in time to avoid the collision. However, V2's inability to avoid the crash was a direct result of V1's failure to use due care and misjudgment of the speed and distance of oncoming vehicles. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to exercise caution and properly assess the traffic conditions before reentering the roadway.
