The reason for this determination is that V1 traveled off the edge of the road on the left side, struck the center steel pillar, and then rolled over and struck the center concrete barrier. Since there is no information available about the driver's actions or any other contributing factors, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact driver error that led to the crash. However, the fact that V1 veered off the road and collided with multiple barriers suggests that the driver may have been distracted, lost control of the vehicle, or made an error in judgment. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
