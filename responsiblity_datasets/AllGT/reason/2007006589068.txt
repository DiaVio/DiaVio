The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way at the intersection. V2 was traveling southbound and encountered a stop sign at the intersection. The driver of V2 stated that she stopped for approximately 3-4 seconds before proceeding into the intersection. However, she mentioned that her view was partially obstructed by another vehicle. Despite this, V2 proceeded into the intersection without ensuring that it was clear, resulting in the collision with V1. V1, on the other hand, was traveling westbound through the intersection and did not have a stop sign. The driver of V1 stated that he was obeying the traffic laws and did not expect V2 to run the stop sign. Therefore, V1's actions were not a contributing factor to the accident. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way at the intersection, even though her view may have been partially obstructed.
