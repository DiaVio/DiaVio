The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn from a stop sign onto a three-lane, two-way roadway. It failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2007 Lexus ES350 sedan, which was traveling west in lane one of the roadway. As a result, the right side of V1 made contact with the front of V2, causing a side slap impact. This initial impact then caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and collide with a parked vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and causing the initial collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
