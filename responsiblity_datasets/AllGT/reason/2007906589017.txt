The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection without having a clear view of the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 stated that she couldn't see the traffic coming from the opposite direction until it was too late. This indicates a decision error on her part, as she should have ensured that it was safe to make the left turn before proceeding. Additionally, the driver of V2 was also talking with her passenger, which could have further distracted her from properly assessing the situation. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn, along with the obstructed view caused by the non-contact truck, makes V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
