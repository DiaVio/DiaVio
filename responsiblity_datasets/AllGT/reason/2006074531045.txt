The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the wet road. This is indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 being coded as "driver related factor; too fast for conditions (wet road)." The driver of V2 stated that he applied the brakes to stop at the intersection but started sliding on the wet road and realized he would not be able to stop. Additionally, the fact that V2 accelerated when he noticed V1 approaching the intersection suggests that he did not have full control of his vehicle and was unable to stop in time.
