The reason for this is that V1 attempted to switch lanes from lane two to lane three, and in doing so, struck V2 on its right side. V1 then fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in their designated lane and minding their own business when they were unexpectedly struck by V1. The driver of V2 was not at fault for the collision.
