The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control while exiting a right curve and traveled off the left side road edge, ultimately impacting a concrete traffic barrier. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to navigate the curve properly, resulting in the crash.
