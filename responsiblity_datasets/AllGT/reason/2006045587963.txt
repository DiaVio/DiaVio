The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed well over the posted speed limit, as indicated by the EDR information. This excessive speed made it difficult for the driver to respond to the unexpected actions of the unknown vehicle traveling southbound, which resulted in Vehicle #1 veering off the road and colliding with the bridge abutment. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway (having driven it rarely) and the fact that she was operating a loaner vehicle (with limited experience) may have contributed to her inability to effectively avoid the collision. It is also worth noting that the driver was not wearing a seatbelt and had unknown medical conditions, which could have further impaired her ability to react appropriately in the situation. Overall, Vehicle #1's excessive speed and inadequate response to the unexpected actions of the other vehicle are the primary reasons for its responsibility in the accident.
