The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The speed limit on the ramp was posted at 113 kmph (70 mph), but there was a flashing advisory of 64 kmph (40 mph) due to the curved ramp and rainy conditions. The driver admitted to inattention and being distracted, as well as conversing with a passenger. Additionally, the vehicle had oversized tires and rims, which may have contributed to the loss of control on the wet pavement.
