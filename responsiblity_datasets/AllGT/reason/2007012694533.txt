The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the weather conditions, which were cold and rainy. The driver admitted that she may have been going a little too fast for the weather at that time. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event and Critical Reason for the Critical Event were both coded as driver-related factors - too fast for conditions. The driver's inexperience, internal distraction (conversing with passengers), and driving over the speed limit further contribute to V1's responsibility for the crash.
