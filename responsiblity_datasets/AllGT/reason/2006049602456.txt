The driver of V2 made an illegal and aggressive maneuver by abruptly changing lanes from lane 2 to lane 1 without signaling, which caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2. Additionally, the fact that the occupants of V2 fled the scene indicates a potential attempt to avoid responsibility for the accident.
