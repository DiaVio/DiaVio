The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was traveling off the right side of the roadway, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle within the designated travel lane. - The driver's inexperience with the vehicle and the route may have contributed to her inability to navigate the curve safely. - The fact that the driver was under the influence of alcohol (BAC of 0.102) suggests impaired judgment and decreased ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver's medical conditions and the medications she was taking may have also affected her ability to drive safely. Overall, the combination of the driver's inexperience, impairment, and potential medical issues likely led to her failure to negotiate the curve properly, resulting in the crash.
