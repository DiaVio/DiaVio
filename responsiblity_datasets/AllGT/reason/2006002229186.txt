The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet and slick roadway conditions. The driver stated that his brakes locked up and he was unable to control the vehicle, resulting in it skidding across the lane line and colliding with Vehicle #2. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling, Over the Lane Line on the Left Side" and the critical reason for this event was identified as a driver-related factor: "Too Fast for Conditions" specified as wet, slick roadway. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 (1992 Plymouth Voyager) attempted to avoid the collision by braking hard and steering right, indicating that she took appropriate evasive action. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "Other Vehicle in Lane, Traveling in Opposite Direction," suggesting that the driver of Vehicle #2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed for the wet and slick roadway conditions, resulting in loss of control and collision with Vehicle #2.
