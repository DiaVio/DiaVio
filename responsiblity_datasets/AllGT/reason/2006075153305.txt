The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the physical evidence indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed too great to maintain traction, resulting in the loss of control and the sideswipe collision with V2 (the 1991 Subaru Legacy). Additionally, the critical precrash event for V1 was coded as traveling too fast for conditions, and the critical reason for the event was attributed to V1's driver-related decision error of going too fast for the curve/turn. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the main factors that led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible.
