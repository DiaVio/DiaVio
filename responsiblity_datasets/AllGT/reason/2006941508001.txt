The reason for V1's primary responsibility is a driver-related recognition error, specifically inattention (daydreaming). The driver of V1 stated that he had numerous concerns on his mind at the time of the crash, including employment, family, and personal relationships. Additionally, the driver mentioned being fatigued from a long drive, lack of adequate sleep, and a recent long-distance move that required heavy lifting for five hours. These physical and emotional factors likely contributed to the driver's inattention and inability to recall the crash events or the precrash movements of the other vehicle. While V2 (the driver of the 1987 Mazda B-series pickup truck) was involved in the crash, there is no information available regarding any contributing factors or actions on their part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
