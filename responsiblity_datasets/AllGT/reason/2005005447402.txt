The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which were rainy, and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the parked vehicle (V4) and subsequently causing the chain reaction with V3 and V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by a work-related dispute and was thinking about it while driving, which further contributed to the crash.
