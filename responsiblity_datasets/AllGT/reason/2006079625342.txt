The driver of Vehicle one had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.13, which is above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This indicates that the driver was impaired at the time of the collision, which likely contributed to their failure to adequately surveil the road and notice that Vehicle two was stopped ahead. Additionally, the driver's statement about working excessively and experiencing stress may have further impaired their ability to focus and react appropriately while driving. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two was stopped behind other cars, waiting for the green light, and was not found to have any critical factors contributing to the collision. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired state, inadequate surveillance, and failure to maintain a safe distance from the stopped Vehicle two.
