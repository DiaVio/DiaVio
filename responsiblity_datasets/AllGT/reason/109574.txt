The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to drift to the right, crossing the lane line and the paved shoulder. This resulted in the right-front wheel climbing the barrier curb and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane led to the accident.
