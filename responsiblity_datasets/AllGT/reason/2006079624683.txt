The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn onto the roadway. The driver reported that her view was blocked by newspaper vendors along the north curb, but it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the intersection is clear before proceeding. The investigation also revealed that V1 did not see V2's approach, indicating a recognition error on the part of V1.
