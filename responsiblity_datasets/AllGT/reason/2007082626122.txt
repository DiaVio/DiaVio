The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention to the road and looking at the traffic light on the next block instead. This indicates inadequate surveillance and a failure to see the other vehicle (V2) entering the intersection. Additionally, the fact that V1 had never driven on this roadway before suggests a lack of familiarity with the area, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to anticipate the presence of other vehicles.
