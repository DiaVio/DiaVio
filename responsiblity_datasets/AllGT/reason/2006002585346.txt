The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and properly negotiate the curve, resulting in the vehicle driving off the right side of the roadway and colliding with a tree. The driver of V1 admitted to going too fast for the turn, indicating that she was not able to control the vehicle properly. Additionally, the driver's statement that she blacked out due to accidentally taking too much medication raises concerns about her ability to operate the vehicle safely. The use of prescription medications with potential side effects of nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and drowsiness, combined with the driver's irregular sleep pattern and history of bipolar disorder, further suggests that her impaired condition contributed to the crash.
