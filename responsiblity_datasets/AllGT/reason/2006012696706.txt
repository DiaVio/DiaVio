The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the icy conditions on the roadway. The driver's decision to travel between 98-113kmph (61-70mph) on a roadway with intermittent patches of ice was a decision error. Additionally, the EDR reading indicated that V1 was traveling at 80 mph five seconds before the crash, which further supports the conclusion that the driver was traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. The use of opiates, relative unfamiliarity with the vehicle, low tread on the tires, and the slick roadway were all contributing factors that further demonstrate the driver's responsibility for the accident.
