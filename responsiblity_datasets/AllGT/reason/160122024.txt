The reason for holding the Honda Accord primarily responsible is that the case occupant was not utilizing the available 3-point lap and shoulder belt, which would have provided restraint and protection during the collision. Additionally, the occupant's injuries, such as the rib fractures, sternal fracture, hand fractures, and pelvic fractures, were caused by her being unrestrained and moving forward upon impact, striking various parts of the interior of the Honda Accord.
