The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was involved in two separate crashes just prior to this one. V1 crossed over multiple lanes of traffic, including the concrete median, and entered the southbound lanes where V2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Lumina sedan) was traveling. V1 then sideswiped V2, causing the crash. The driver of V1 reported experiencing issues with the vehicle's steering and a warning light on the dashboard, indicating a problem between the engine and transmission. The driver also exhibited confusion and an altered level of consciousness at the scene. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was not in a proper condition to operate the vehicle safely, leading to the crash.
