The reason for this is that V2 impacted the left side of V1 as it entered the intersection. This suggests that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was stopped at a stop sign and making a left turn. V2's failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, V2's subsequent rotation and impact with Vehicle 3 (V3) further indicates that V2 was the primary cause of the accident.
