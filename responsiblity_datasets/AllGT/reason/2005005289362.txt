The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already crossing the intersection. The view of V2 may have been obstructed by another vehicle, but it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to make the turn. Additionally, the fact that the intersection was at the top of a slight hill may have further obstructed the view, but it does not absolve V2 of their responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic.
