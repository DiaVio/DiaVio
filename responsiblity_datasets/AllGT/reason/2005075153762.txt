The reason for this is that Vehicle one, driven by a 51-year-old female, was traveling westbound in lane one and made contact with the back of Vehicle two (the 1978 Jeep CJ-7) which was legally parked along the north curb facing westbound. Vehicle one was partially in the westbound lane and the implied parking lane. The critical reason for the accident was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically an "unknown recognition error." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle one failed to recognize the presence of the parked Vehicle two and collided with it. While there were associative factors such as the driver's recent trip abroad and changed sleep schedule due to time change, these factors do not absolve the driver of Vehicle one from responsibility for the accident. The driver should have been aware of her surroundings and recognized the presence of the parked vehicle, regardless of any external factors affecting her state of mind.
