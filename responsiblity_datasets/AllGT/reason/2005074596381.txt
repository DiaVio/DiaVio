The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had a seizure while driving, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and veer off the roadway, ultimately resulting in the collision with the pole and the subsequent rollover. The driver's decision to not take his medication for seizures, combined with the physical exertion from playing sports prior to the crash, contributed to the driver experiencing a seizure and blacking out while behind the wheel.
