The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the critical reason for this behavior was coded as "driver related factor; overcompensation," suggesting that the driver may have overcorrected after initially traveling over the lane line. Overall, the driver's actions of crossing the lane line and subsequently overcompensating led to V1 rotating off the right side of the road and colliding with a pole and a building.
