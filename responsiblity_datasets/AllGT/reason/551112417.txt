The reason for this is that V2 impacted the right side of V1 while it was crossing the highway. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was stopped at a stop sign and had the obligation to cross the highway safely. V2's impact forced V1 off the roadway and caused the driver of V1 to sustain injuries.
