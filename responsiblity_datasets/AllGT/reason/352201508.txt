The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was the one that swerved into the southbound travel direction, crossing into the path of Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 2 attempted to steer right but was unsuccessful, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 1. The actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, in response to the animal entering the roadway, ultimately led to the collision.
