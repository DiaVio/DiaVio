The driver of V1 admitted to making a left-hand turn in front of oncoming traffic without realizing that the oncoming traffic had the right of way. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was a 16-year old with only one week of driving experience, which suggests inexperience played a role in the crash. On the other hand, the driver of V2, the 1998 GMC Jimmy, reported that he was traveling at a reasonable speed and did not have time to react to the sudden left turn of V1. The critical pre-crash event for the driver of V2 was the encroachment of V1 into the opposite direction's left lane, indicating that V2 was not at fault and did not contribute to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error, inadequate surveillance, and inexperience.
