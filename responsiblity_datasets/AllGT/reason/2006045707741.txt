The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed on a residential roadway, exceeding the posted speed limit and advisory speed for the curve. - V1 crossed the centerline and struck V2 head-on, indicating a failure to maintain their lane. - The driver of V1 admitted to taking the curve too fast and being unable to stay in their lane. - The driver of V1 was distracted by the chase vehicle, which was a rearward exterior factor, and was focused on it instead of maintaining control of their vehicle. - The emotional state of the driver, being upset and in a hurry to flee the chasing vehicle, likely contributed to their reckless driving behavior. - The driver of V1 was also inexperienced, having only been driving for 18 months, which may have affected their ability to handle the curve safely. - Additionally, the dangerously low tread on the tires of V1 (5mm) was a vehicle deficiency that further compromised the driver's control over the vehicle. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
