The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn onto the main roadway. The driver of V1 reported that she stopped at the end of the driveway and checked both directions for approaching traffic, but she failed to see V2 (the 1994 GMC Suburban) before the impact. This indicates a driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. On the other hand, the driver of V2 reported seeing V1 approaching the roadway and even made eye contact with the driver of V1. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering left, but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and recognize the presence of V2 before making the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
