The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by focusing on a non-contact vehicle and not looking far enough ahead. This distraction caused V1 to turn left in the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 1999 Hyundai Tiburon). V1's failure to exercise caution and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the subsequent collision with V3 (the 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer). Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to properly assess the situation and yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
