The reason for this is that V1 drifted over the center lane line and departed the left side of the roadway, ultimately colliding with two trees. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane, leading to the accident. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not wearing a seatbelt, which could have contributed to the severity of their injuries.
