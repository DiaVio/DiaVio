The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling westbound and intended to cross through the intersection, while Vehicle 1, the 2005 Honda Civic, was in the eastbound left turn lane, intending to turn left into the shopping mall. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and Vehicle 2's frontal plane struck the right side plane of Vehicle 1. Since Vehicle 2 was crossing through the intersection, it had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic, including Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way, resulting in the collision.
