The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a left turn at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of the oncoming V1. The driver of V2 stated that she thought she could make her turn in front of the other vehicle, indicating a misjudgment on her part. Additionally, the driver of V2 was distracted by having a conversation with a passenger, listening to the radio, and eating food, which could have contributed to her misjudgment and inability to properly assess the situation. Therefore, V2's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, as well as the driver-related factors of distraction and rushing due to being behind schedule, make V2 primarily responsible for the collision.
