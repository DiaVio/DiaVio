The driver of V1 was making a left turn from the fourth travel lane, which was a left turn only lane. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver stated that he stopped for 3-4 seconds prior to entering the intersection, but did not see V2 (the 1994 Nissan Altima) before the impact. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surrounding traffic. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that the light was green and he did not have time to attempt any evasive maneuvers. Although V2 encroached over the left lane line, this action alone does not seem to be the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to observe the oncoming vehicle before making the left turn.
