The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: internal distraction. V2 was using a GPS unit on his cell phone at the time of the crash, which distracted him from properly observing the intersection and the oncoming traffic. Additionally, V2 stated that he was not comfortable with the many roadways intersecting at this location, indicating a lack of familiarity and possibly contributing to his distraction. On the other hand, V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. While V1's focus on lighting a cigarette and assumption that V2 would yield the right-of-way were associated factors, the primary responsibility lies with V2 due to the distraction caused by using the GPS device and his uneasiness with the intersection. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
