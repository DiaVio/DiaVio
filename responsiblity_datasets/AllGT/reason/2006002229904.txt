The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to starting to skid on the snow and ice-covered roadway. The critical pre-crash event was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was determined to be driver-related error, specifically decision errors and driving too fast for the icy and snowy conditions. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed and driving behavior according to the road conditions.
