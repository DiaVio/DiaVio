The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to maintain a safe following distance and control their vehicle in the wet conditions. The driver of V1 was distracted by adjusting the climate control and did not notice that V2 had stopped in front of them. As a result, V1 slid on the wet pavement and collided with the back of V2. While V2 may have been traveling at a higher speed, they were not the primary cause of the accident. V2 was following the flow of traffic and came to a stop as required. V1's failure to maintain control and keep a safe distance led to the collision.
