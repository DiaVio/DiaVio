The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating inadequate surveillance or failure to look properly before attempting to pass the box truck. This action resulted in a head-on collision with Vehicle #1 (the Pontiac Grand Am) in the northbound lane.
