The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection." This indicates that Vehicle one was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as "driver related factor: type of driver error unknown." This suggests that there was some form of driver error on the part of the driver of Vehicle one, although the specific details are unknown. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two (the 1997 Volkswagen Jetta) was coded as "other motor vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that Vehicle two was encroached upon by Vehicle one, which was turning left across the opposite lane. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was not coded to this vehicle, meaning that the responsibility for the encroachment is not attributed to Vehicle two. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the collision due to making a left turn at the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic.
