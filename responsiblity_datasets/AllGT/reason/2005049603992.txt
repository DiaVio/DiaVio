The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which was the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to not having slept for the past 29 hours and attempted to find a place to rest before entering the roadway. This indicates that the driver was fatigued and not in a condition to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, there was no evidence of household goods in the vehicle, suggesting that the driver's claim of moving was not accurate. The driver's appearance also indicated that they may have attended a social event, further suggesting that fatigue and impairment played a role in the crash.
