The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 (the driver of the 2001 Honda CR-V) and rear-ended V2 when the traffic light turned green. V1 falsely assumed that V2 would immediately proceed when the light changed, but V2 did not move forward right away. This false assumption led to V1's decision to accelerate before V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there were no additional associated factors identified for V1, indicating that their primary responsibility lies in their failure to maintain a safe distance and their false assumption of V2's actions.
