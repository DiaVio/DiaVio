The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of other road users. The driver of V2 was following a non-contact vehicle at a gap distance of 15 meters (50 feet) at a driver-estimated speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This speed, combined with the obstructed view caused by the non-contact vehicle, prevented the driver of V2 from detecting V1 in time to avoid the collision.
