The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and was unable to stay in their travel lane while negotiating a curve. This resulted in V1 crossing over the centerline and impacting the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). V1's admission to the police that they were going too fast for the curve further supports their responsibility for the accident.
