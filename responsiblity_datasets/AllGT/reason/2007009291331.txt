The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 105 kmph (65 mph), which is at least 10 miles over the speed limit.

These factors contributed to V1's performance error of overcompensation when the driver attempted to regain control of the vehicle after being overtaken by the beige sedan.
