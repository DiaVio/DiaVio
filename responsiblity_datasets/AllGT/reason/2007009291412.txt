The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision error and misjudged the gap or the speed of the vehicle in lane two. Instead of using the available 3.3 meter wide paved shoulder to avoid the boom truck, the driver braked hard, causing the vehicle to skid and veer off the road, ultimately crashing into the elevated driveway and drainage pipe. This decision error led to the accident and subsequent damages.
