The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it crossed the double yellow center lane lines and entered the travel path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe four-door large utility vehicle. This resulted in the front left corner of V1 impacting the front left corner of V2, causing severe damage to both vehicles and leading to the deployment of the case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner and airbags. Additionally, V1 continued traveling in a northwesterly direction, departed the roadway, and sideswiped a tree, resulting in minor damage. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control and stay within its own lane, further supporting its primary responsibility for the accident.
