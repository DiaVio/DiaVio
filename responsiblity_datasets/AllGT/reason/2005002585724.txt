The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and flashing red beacon. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 coming when she proceeded into the intersection. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. On the other hand, the driver of V2 had the right of way as they were traveling on the main roadway with a posted speed limit and clear sight line to the other vehicle. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, but it was too late. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the crash.
