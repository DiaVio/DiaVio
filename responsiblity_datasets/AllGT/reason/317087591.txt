The reason for this is that V1 initiated the lane change by moving from the 2nd lane to the left, attempting to cross the center lane and enter the fourth travel lane. In doing so, V1 struck the rear left bumper of Vehicle 2 (V2), causing V2 to lose control and veer off the roadway. V1 then continued forward and ultimately collided with a guardrail. Therefore, V1's lane change maneuver and subsequent collision with V2 set off a chain of events that led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
