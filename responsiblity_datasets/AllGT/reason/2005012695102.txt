The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that their vehicle stalled in the second lane of oncoming traffic while attempting to make a left turn. This unexpected stop in the path of V2 (the driver of the 1986 SAAB 900) caused the collision. V2 stated that she thought V1's car would continue to make the turn, but it stopped right in her path of travel. V2 applied the brakes but could not avoid the impact. Therefore, V1's vehicle control loss due to a stalled engine and subsequent stop in the path of V2's travel is the primary reason for the crash.
