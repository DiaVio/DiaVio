The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was distracted and not paying adequate attention to the roadway. He admitted to reading a text message on his cell phone and conversing with his passengers prior to the crash. Additionally, he tested positive for marijuana and had not taken his prescribed medication for attention deficit disorder. These factors contributed to his inadequate surveillance and ultimately led to the collision with V1.
