The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2 until just prior to the crash, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness. Additionally, associated factors such as mismatched size wheels/tires and no tread on the right front tire suggest potential maintenance issues with V1's vehicle, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to avoid the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Jeep Liberty) was encroached upon by V1, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event coded for V2. However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and potential vehicle maintenance issues.
