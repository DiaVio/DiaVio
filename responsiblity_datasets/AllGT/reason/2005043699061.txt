The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She either did not look for oncoming traffic or looked but did not see the oncoming Toyota Camry (V2). Additionally, V1 entered the intersection when her view was obstructed by the non-contact vehicle in front of her. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision. V2, on the other hand, attempted to steer left to avoid V1 but did not apply the brakes. While V2's evasive action was inadequate, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly assessing the situation and yielding to oncoming traffic. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield, while V2's associated factor of inadequate evasive action contributes to the overall circumstances of the accident.
