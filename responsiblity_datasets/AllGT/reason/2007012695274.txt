The reason for this is that the driver of V2 admitted to not seeing V1 prior to the impact and stated that she was distracted by putting her cigarette lighter into the console. This indicates that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, which is an example of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V2 was the vehicle traveling and passing over the crossing through the intersection, which further supports the driver's failure to properly observe the surroundings. Therefore, V2's failure to exercise proper surveillance and attention while driving makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
