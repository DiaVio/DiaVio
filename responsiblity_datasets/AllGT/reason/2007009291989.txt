The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. Although V2 stated that he checked that his path was clear before making the left turn, he did not see the approaching V1, which resulted in the collision. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V1.
