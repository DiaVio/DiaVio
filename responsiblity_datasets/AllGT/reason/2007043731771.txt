The driver of V1 admitted that he was distracted while reaching down for a pack of cigarettes, which caused him to drive off the right side of the road. This distraction led to V1 striking two culverts and rolling over onto its top. Additionally, the driver was not wearing a seat belt, which could have contributed to the severity of his injuries. The tire deficiency, with the right rear tire tread measured at 0/32, is also a contributing factor to the accident.
