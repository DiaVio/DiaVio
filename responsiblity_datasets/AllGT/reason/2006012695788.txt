The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was distracted by looking down and to his right to pick up a fallen juice bottle, taking his attention away from the road. - V1 admitted to driving with a suspended license, which is a violation of traffic laws. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not notice V2 crossing from left to right until the last second. - V1 was traveling at a speed of 37 mph in a 25 mph zone, according to the Event Data Recorder (EDR) data. These factors indicate that V1's distracted driving, violation of traffic laws, inadequate surveillance, and excess speed contributed to the crash.
