The reason for this is that V1 was changing lanes to the left without using a turn signal, which is considered an unsafe lane change. This action caused V1 to collide with the right front bumper corner of V2 (the driver of the 2007 Toyota Camry sedan), resulting in the subsequent chain of events leading to the collision with the concrete center divider and the embankment area. It is important to note that the reason for V1's unsafe lane change is unknown, as the driver was not interviewed. However, based on the information provided, V1's failure to signal and safely change lanes is the primary factor contributing to the accident.
