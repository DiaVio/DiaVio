The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, specifically failing to notice that V2 (the 1986 Ford F150 pickup) had stopped to turn left at the intersection. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, V1's pre-event movement was coded as "negotiating a curve," indicating that the driver was navigating a curved section of the road. It is possible that the driver's attention was focused on negotiating the curve, leading to a failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the road and notice the stopped vehicle in front.
