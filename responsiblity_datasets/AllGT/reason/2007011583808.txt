The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was unable to avoid hitting the deer that ran into the roadway. The driver stated that he was traveling at a speed of about 108 kmph (67 mph) with his cruise control on, which may have limited his ability to react quickly to the sudden appearance of the deer. Additionally, the driver mentioned that he never saw the deer until after he had already hit it, indicating a lack of awareness of the animal's presence. While there were contributing factors such as the darkness of the area and the driver's limited knowledge of the roadway, ultimately it was V1's inability to avoid the collision with the deer that makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
