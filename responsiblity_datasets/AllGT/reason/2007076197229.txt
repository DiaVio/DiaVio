The driver of V1 admitted to possibly passing out before the collision, and this was supported by the driver's son and daughter who mentioned a previous incident where the driver had passed out and hit a parked car. The driver's medical records also indicated a history of diabetes, heart ailments, memory problems, and a hearing deficit. The driver was taking multiple medications, including those for high blood pressure, but it is unknown if he was taking medication for diabetes or other medical conditions at the time of the collision. The driver's decision to steer hard left after departing the roadway to the right, as well as the overcompensation and selection of inappropriate evasive action, were considered contributing factors to the collision. However, these actions occurred after the driver had apparently awakened from passing out and departing the roadway. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the unknown critical non-performance, possibly related to passing out while driving.
