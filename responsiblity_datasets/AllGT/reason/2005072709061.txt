The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a non-contact vehicle approaching from the rear and attempting to pass on her left side. As a result of this distraction, V1 veered over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, ultimately colliding with the parked Vehicle two (V2). V1's failure to maintain proper control of her vehicle and stay within her lane, combined with the fact that V2 was legally parked and unoccupied, indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
