The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to not paying adequate attention to the road ahead. Instead of focusing on the traffic in front of him, he was distracted by trying to change lanes and looking to his left. This lack of surveillance and failure to use due care led to V1 not being able to stop in time and colliding with the back of V2, which then caused a chain reaction with V3. Therefore, V1's driver error of inadequate surveillance is the main factor that caused the accident.
