The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the Ford F-150). V1 claimed to have looked left but did not see V2, indicating a lack of proper observation before entering the intersection. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
