The driver of V1 attempted a left turn into the crossover, which is an illegal maneuver as the only way to access the rest area is from the westbound lanes. This decision error led to V1 traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, resulting in the collision with V2. The wet roadway and rain were contributing factors, but the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for making an illegal left turn.
