The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, crossing the path of V2 (the driver of the 2004 Kia Optima). This failure to stop and yield the right of way resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the stop sign and being distracted, possibly looking to his left for a brief second. This inattention and inadequate surveillance contributed to the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was obeying the traffic laws, decelerating as he approached the intersection. He saw V1 run the stop sign and attempted to brake, but was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. While the driver of V2 mentioned being in a hurry and thinking about a future event, these factors do not absolve the primary responsibility of V1 for failing to stop at the stop sign. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and their inattention while driving.
