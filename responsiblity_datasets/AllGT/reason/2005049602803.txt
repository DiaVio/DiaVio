The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a U-turn around the east tip of the west median, which is an illegal maneuver. V1 failed to adequately surveil the area and did not look to the rear before making the U-turn. This lack of surveillance and failure to follow proper traffic rules resulted in V1 crossing over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, directly into the path of V2 (the 2000 International 4700 flatbed/tow truck). Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and inadequate surveillance are the main factors that led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
