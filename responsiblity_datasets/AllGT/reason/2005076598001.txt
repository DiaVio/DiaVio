The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, causing the vehicle to drift off the road and collide with the guardrail. The driver's admission of being asleep, combined with the fact that the critical pre-crash event was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side due to the driver being asleep, clearly indicates that the driver's fatigue and lack of attention were the main factors leading to the accident.
