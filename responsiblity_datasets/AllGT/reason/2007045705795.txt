The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to look far enough ahead, which was coded as the critical reason for the crash. The driver of V1 admitted that she didn't see V2 in time to stop, indicating a lack of attention and awareness on her part. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was taking medication for a back-related issue, which could have potentially impaired her ability to react in a timely manner. On the other hand, V2 (the 1999 Oldsmobile Intrigue) was stopped in the eastbound lane, waiting to turn left onto a side road. The driver of V2 stated that he saw V1 coming at him quickly before getting hit, suggesting that he was stationary and not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to look ahead and react in time to avoid colliding with the stopped vehicle, V2.
