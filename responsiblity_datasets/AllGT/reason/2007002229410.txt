The driver of Vehicle #1, a part-time police officer, was distracted and failed to stop in time to avoid colliding with the stopped truck in front of them. This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped" and the Critical Reason coded as "driver related factor, internal distraction". The driver of Vehicle #1 did not provide an interview, but a passenger in the vehicle confirmed that the driver had been looking at him before the collision occurred.
