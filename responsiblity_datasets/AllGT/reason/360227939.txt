The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and lost control while negotiating a right curve. This resulted in V1 sliding off the roadway and impacting a sign post, causing the vehicle to trip and roll over multiple times before coming to a rest. The driver of V1 also sustained minor injuries, indicating that their actions contributed to the crash.
