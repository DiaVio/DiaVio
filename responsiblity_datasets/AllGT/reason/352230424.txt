The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a U-turn at the intersection, which requires the driver to yield to oncoming traffic. However, Vehicle 2 (the 2002 Ford F-150 pick-up truck) was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Vehicle 1 failed to yield and entered the path of Vehicle 2, resulting in the near-side impact.
