The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that V1 struck the deer, causing it to be flung into the path of V2 (the driver of the 2004 Mercury Monterey minivan). V1's actions initiated the chain of events that led to the collision between V2 and the deer, resulting in V2 leaving the roadway and striking multiple trees. While V2 did not see the second deer that was struck by V1, V2's involvement in the accident was a direct result of V1's initial collision with the deer. Therefore, V1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
