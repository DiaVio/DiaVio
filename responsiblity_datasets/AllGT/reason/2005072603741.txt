The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and swerved to the right, crossing the center lane and striking V2 (the 2000 International 9900 tractor) in the right lane. This initial action by V1 initiated the chain of events that led to the crash. Additionally, it was found that the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol level of 0.226, indicating impairment due to alcohol consumption. This further supports the conclusion that V1's actions and impaired state were the primary cause of the crash.
