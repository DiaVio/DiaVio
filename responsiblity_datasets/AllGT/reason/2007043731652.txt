The reason for this is that V2 attempted to merge into lane one, where V1 was already traveling, and struck the back of V1. V2's driver made an error in judgment by traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, which led to the collision. Additionally, V2's driver did not stop after the crash and never returned to the scene, which further demonstrates their responsibility for the accident.
