The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the posted stop signs at the four-legged intersection. This failure to yield the right of way resulted in V1 crossing through the intersection without stopping and subsequently colliding with a parked car. The impact caused V1 to drift to the right and initiate the rollover sequence, ultimately leading to the crash.
