The driver of vehicle one was under the influence of alcohol, as indicated by her high BAC level of 0.14. This impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle and contributed to her loss of control while negotiating the curve. Additionally, the driver admitted to consuming alcohol throughout the day, which further compromised her judgment and reaction time. Furthermore, the driver was distracted by arguing with the passenger at the time of the crash. This internal distraction diverted her attention away from the road and likely contributed to her departure from the lane and subsequent collision with the guy wire. The driver's medication, psychological condition, and stress level were also contributing factors. The use of Alprazolam, combined with the driver's psychological disorder, may have affected her cognitive abilities and decision-making. Additionally, the stress from learning a new position could have further impaired her focus and ability to handle the vehicle safely. Overall, the combination of alcohol impairment, distraction, and other contributing factors led to the driver's loss of control and the subsequent crash. Therefore, vehicle one (V1) is primarily responsible for the accident.
