The reason for this is that the non-contact vehicle began to merge into the outside lane, encroaching on the case vehicle's path. This forced the driver of the case vehicle to veer right onto the concrete shoulder to avoid a collision. The sudden maneuver caused the driver to lose control of the case vehicle, resulting in the head-on collision with the concrete median barrier. Therefore, the actions of the non-contact vehicle directly led to the chain of events that caused the accident.
