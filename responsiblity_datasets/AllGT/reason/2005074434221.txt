The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was driving aggressively and racing another vehicle. As a result, when he came upon a slower moving vehicle in his lane, he veered into another lane to avoid it and ended up colliding with V2. This aggressive driving behavior ultimately led to the loss of control of V1 and the subsequent rollover.
