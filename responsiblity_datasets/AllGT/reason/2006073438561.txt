The driver of Vehicle one admitted to not seeing the stopped vehicles ahead and stated that he was daydreaming at the time of the crash. This indicates a clear case of inattention and driver error, which led to the collision with the back of Vehicle two (1999 Chevrolet Monte Carlo). As a result, Vehicle two was pushed into the back of Vehicle three (1993 Pontiac Grand Prix). Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and failure to notice the stopped vehicles ahead.
