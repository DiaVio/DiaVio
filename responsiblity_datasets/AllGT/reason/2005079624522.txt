The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the critical pre-crash event, the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of the other vehicle (V2). V1 stated that they saw V2 approaching but assumed it would stop, which indicates a driver-related decision error. This false assumption led to V1 turning in front of V2, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2004 Toyota Tundra) reported that they were approaching the intersection on a green light and attempted to stop when they saw V1 turning, but were unsuccessful. This suggests that V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their false assumption of the other vehicle's actions.
