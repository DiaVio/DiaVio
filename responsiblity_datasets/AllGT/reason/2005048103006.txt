The driver of V1 was driving on the wrong side of the roadway, in the eastbound lane, which directly led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .157, indicating impairment due to alcohol consumption. The presence of an opiate and the admission of taking Clonazepam further suggest that the driver was under the influence of substances that can impair driving abilities. Fatigue is also considered a factor for this driver. These factors, including driving on the wrong side of the road, impaired driving due to alcohol and medication, and potential fatigue, all contribute to V1 being primarily responsible for the crash.
