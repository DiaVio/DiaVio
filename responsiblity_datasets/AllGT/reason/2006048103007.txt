The driver of V1 admitted that she was traveling in lane one and failed to realize that Vehicle 2 (V2) was stopped ahead of her. This indicates a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the other vehicle. The critical event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," further supporting the fact that V1 failed to notice the stopped vehicle ahead. The critical reason for this driver-related factor was "misjudgment of gap or other's speed." Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance and misjudgment of the situation.
