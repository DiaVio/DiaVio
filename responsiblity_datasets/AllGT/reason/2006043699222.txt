The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a wet, curved roadway. The driver's estimated speed of 72kmph (45 mph) was the same as the posted speed limit, but it was not appropriate for the wet conditions. Additionally, the driver had not taken any form of driver's education and was taking an unspecified pain killer at the time of the crash, which may have impaired their judgment or reaction time. There was no evidence found on-scene to support the driver's claim that an oncoming vehicle forced them off the roadway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
