The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn onto the arterial road. Even though V2 may have been traveling at an excessive speed, V1 had sufficient time to see V2 and avoid the collision by either making an avoidance maneuver or completing the turn. However, V1 did not check to the left before proceeding from the stop sign, indicating a lack of proper surveillance.
