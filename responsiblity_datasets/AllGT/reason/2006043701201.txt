The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of the 1996 Ford Explorer sport utility was distracted and not paying attention to the road. He admitted to looking away from the road and motioning to his daughter in the back seat, causing him to drift into the right curb and deflate the right front tire. This distraction led to V1 crossing the roadway, impacting a streetlight pole, and ultimately rolling over. The driver's admission of not watching the road and the police-reported travel speed being higher than the posted speed limit also contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
