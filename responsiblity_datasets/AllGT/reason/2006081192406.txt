The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while merging onto the main roadway. The driver admitted to traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which resulted in the loss of control. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and did not adjust their speed to match the road conditions. As a result, V1 entered the main lanes and collided with V2. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in their designated lane and took evasive action by applying the brakes and steering left when they realized V1 was approaching. This suggests that the driver of V2 reacted appropriately to the situation and attempted to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to adjust their speed for the icy road conditions and maintain control of their vehicle while merging onto the main roadway.
