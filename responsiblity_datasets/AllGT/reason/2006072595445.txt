The reason for this determination is that Vehicle One departed the right side of the roadway, impacted a fire hydrant and a large pole, and eventually rolled over before coming to rest on its roof. The lack of PAR and interview information for the driver of Vehicle One makes it difficult to determine the exact cause of the crash, but the driver's actions of steering back and forth, as well as the vehicle's multiple impacts and rollover, suggest a potential driver error or loss of control.
