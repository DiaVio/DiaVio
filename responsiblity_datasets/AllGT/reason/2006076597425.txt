The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver of V1 stated that he didn't realize that V2 was slowing down soon enough to make any avoidance maneuvers. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a key factor in preventing rear-end collisions. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating." This suggests that V1 failed to anticipate and react to the deceleration of V2, further supporting the conclusion that V1 was following too closely. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to respond to the deceleration of the vehicle in front.
