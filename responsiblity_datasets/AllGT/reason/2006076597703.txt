The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at an intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event attributed to V1. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor: external distraction," indicating that the driver of V1 was distracted by waving to a friend on a motorcycle. This distraction likely caused the driver of V1 to fail to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2.
