The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it initiated a left turn from the westbound lane without yielding the right of way to Vehicle two (V2). V1 reportedly stopped at the intersection, indicating an intention to turn, but failed to ensure that it was safe to proceed. This resulted in V2 being unable to avoid the collision, as V1 entered its path.
