The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the center-line and departed off the road, ultimately resulting in the impact with the utility pole. The driver of Vehicle 1 was reportedly not restrained by a three-point belt, indicating a lack of proper safety precautions. Additionally, the right-rear passenger of Vehicle 1 was also reportedly not restrained by a three-point belt. These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle 1 may have been driving recklessly or negligently, which led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the utility pole.
