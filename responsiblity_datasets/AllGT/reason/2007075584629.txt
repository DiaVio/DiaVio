The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 failed to properly observe and react to the presence of V2, which was legally parked in lane three to close the traffic lane. Despite seeing the sign indicating the left lane closure, V1 misjudged the distance and speed of V2 and attempted to change lanes too late, resulting in a collision with the impact attenuator attached to V2. Additionally, V1's exterior distraction of looking in the right lane, even though it was occupied, contributed to the inadequate surveillance. This distraction likely diverted V1's attention away from the immediate surroundings and prevented her from properly assessing the situation ahead. Overall, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and misjudgment of the gap distance and speed of V2 led to the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
