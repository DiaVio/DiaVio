The reason for this is that V1 made a wide right turn from the driveway without properly ensuring that the lane was clear. The driver of V1 stated that he looked to make sure that traffic was clear in the number one lane before making the maneuver, but he did not expect V2 (the driver of the Subaru) to change lanes just before the intersection. V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to exercise caution while making the turn contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
