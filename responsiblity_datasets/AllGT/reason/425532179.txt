The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was stopped at a stop sign and began turning left without yielding the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 large pickup) which was proceeding straight through the intersection. The left plane of Vehicle 1 was struck by the front plane of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to properly yield and caused the collision.
