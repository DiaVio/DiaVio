The reason for this is that V1's trailer began to shift back and forth, causing the driver to lose control. Despite the driver's attempt to brake, the trailer continued to push V1 at a constant speed. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain proper control of the vehicle, leading to the departure from the lane of travel and ultimately the crash. Additionally, the driver's fatigue and discomfort with the cargo load are considered contributing factors to the crash. The driver had been engaged in intense physical activity for 10 hours prior to the crash, which likely affected his alertness and ability to react effectively. Furthermore, the driver admitted that he was traveling too fast for the cargo load, indicating a lack of judgment and awareness of the limitations of the vehicle and its load. Overall, V1's loss of control, combined with the driver's fatigue and poor judgment, make them primarily responsible for the crash.
