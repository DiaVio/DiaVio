The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, specifically the large rock in the roadway. This is evident from the driver's statement to the police that he came upon the rock in the road and had no time to avoid it. The driver's failure to properly observe the road and anticipate potential hazards led to the collision with the rock, loss of control, and subsequent crash into the embankment.
