The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted while driving, specifically reaching over to the passenger door to roll up the window. This internal distraction caused V1 to drift off the right road edge and ultimately led to the rollover accident. The driver's inadequate surveillance, panic, overcompensation, and poor directional control were also contributing factors to the accident.
