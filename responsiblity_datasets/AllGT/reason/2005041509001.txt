The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error and an illegal maneuver by attempting to turn left at the intersection under a yellow arrow. The driver admitted to trying to beat the light and continued to follow the traffic stream after her light turned red. Additionally, there was a sightline restriction caused by shrubbery and the uphill slope, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to see the approaching V2. While V2 (the Jaguar X-type) had associated factors such as fatigue, emotional stress, and being in a hurry, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the decision error and illegal maneuver made by the driver.
