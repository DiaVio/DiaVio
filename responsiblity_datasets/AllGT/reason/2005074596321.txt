The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was distracted by the ill-fated non-contact vehicle that was signaling to turn left in the wrong direction onto the interstate. This distraction caused the driver of V2 to not properly survey the intersection and fail to yield to V1 as she made her left turn. Additionally, the non-contact vehicle caused a sightline restriction between V1 and V2 as V1 approached the intersection.
