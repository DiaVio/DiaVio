The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that V2 (the Subaru Forester) was stopped in her lane and did not apply the brakes in time to avoid the crash. The driver of V1 was distracted by looking to the left and did not realize that V2 was stopped until it was too late. This indicates a driver-related factor of external distraction. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 72 kmph, suggesting that V1 was traveling at the same speed as V2 and should have had enough time to react and stop safely. Therefore, V1's failure to notice the stopped vehicle and apply the brakes in time makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
