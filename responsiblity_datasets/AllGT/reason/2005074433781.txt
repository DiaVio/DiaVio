The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the red traffic light and violated the traffic signal. They realized their mistake too late and applied their brakes to avoid a collision with V2 (the 1998 Mack Dump Truck). However, the impact still occurred, indicating that V1's failure to obey the traffic signal was the critical reason for the collision.
