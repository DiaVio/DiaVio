The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1994 Nissan Altima) who was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1 falsely assumed that V2 would not enter the intersection on a red light, leading to the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1 was traveling at a speed of 24 kmph (15 mph) indicates that they were not maintaining a safe speed for making the left turn, especially considering the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) on the main road. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to yield the right of way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
