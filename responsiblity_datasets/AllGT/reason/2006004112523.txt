The driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road properly. He was looking down at directions and adjusting the radio when he realized that the cars in front of him were slowing down. He veered to the right to try and avoid the collision with V2, but he did not have enough time to do so. Additionally, the driver exhibited inadequate evasive action by only steering right instead of steering right and braking, which could have been more effective in preventing the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, inadequate evasive action, and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
