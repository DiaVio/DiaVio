The driver of V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 2004 Chevy Impala sedan) traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1's driver admitted to making false assumptions about the actions of the other vehicle and was inattentive. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and inattentiveness led to the collision.
