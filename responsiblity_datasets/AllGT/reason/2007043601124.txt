The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 took incorrect evasive action when the alleged vehicle from lane 3 suddenly swerved into his lane. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle and applying sufficient braking, the driver steered right and lost control of the car. This resulted in V1 driving off the right side of the roadway, climbing an embankment, and ultimately colliding with trees and rolling onto its left side. Additionally, the driver's lack of experience and training, as mentioned in the case summary, contributed to the poor directional control and inability to handle the situation with the skill expected of a good driver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action, insufficient braking, poor directional control, and lack of experience.
