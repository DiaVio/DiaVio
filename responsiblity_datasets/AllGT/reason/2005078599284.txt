The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, who was traveling on the thru street and had the right of way. V2 made a rolling stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection to make a left turn, misjudging the gap and speed of V1. This action by the driver of V2 resulted in the collision with V1.
