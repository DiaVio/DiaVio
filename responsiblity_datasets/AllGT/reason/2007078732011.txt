The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the 1996 Dodge Caravan). V1 stated that she saw V2 but thought she had enough time to make her turn. However, the collision occurred when the front of V1 struck the left side of V2. While V2 was cited for encroaching over the left lane line from the opposite direction, the critical reason for this pre-crash event was not coded to V2. Additionally, V2's fatigue from working ten hours in the fields prior to the crash was considered an associated factor but not the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed while turning left makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
