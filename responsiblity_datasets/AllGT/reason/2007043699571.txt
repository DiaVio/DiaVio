The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the loss of control of the vehicle. V1 negotiated the curve and then began a counterclockwise yaw, resulting in a 270-degree rotation across lanes two and three. This loss of control ultimately led to the collision with V2 (the 2007 Ford Expedition). Additionally, the investigating officer noted that the tires of V1 had inadequate tread depth, which could have contributed to the loss of control. V2, on the other hand, was not found to have any critical reason or associated factors that would attribute primary responsibility to them. The driver of V2 stated that she braked without lockup but was unable to avoid the crash when V1 spun out in front of her. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the loss of control, while V2 does not bear primary responsibility based on the information provided.
