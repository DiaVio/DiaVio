The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection. The driver stated that she knew the intersection was ahead but it "snuck up" on her, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. This is further supported by the critical pre-crash event being coded as "inadequate surveillance." Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 64 kmph, exceeding the speed limit of 56 kmph. This suggests that the driver may have been traveling too fast for the conditions, further contributing to the inadequate surveillance and inability to properly navigate the intersection.
