The police witness statement indicates that V1 was driving erratically, swerving in and out of lanes and almost striking other vehicles. This behavior suggests a lack of control and potentially reckless driving, which ultimately led to V1 departing the roadway, flipping over, and colliding with a tree. The critical reason for the critical event is coded as an unknown critical non-performance error, further indicating that the driver of V1 was at fault.
