The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle #2 (the 2004 Toyota Corolla) when it stopped at the yellow light. The driver of Vehicle #1 assumed that Vehicle #2 would continue through the yellow light, which was a false assumption. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 had only 2 months of experience driving this type of large vehicle, indicating inexperience. The wet roadway may have also contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 stopped at the yellow light as expected, but was still struck from behind by Vehicle #1. While the driver of Vehicle #2 had some associated factors such as unfamiliarity with the roadway and the wet conditions, it was ultimately the failure of Vehicle #1 to stop in time that caused the accident. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
