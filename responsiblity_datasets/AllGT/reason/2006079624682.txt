The driver of V1 failed to detect the warning signs of road construction ahead and did not observe the traffic cones. She attempted to merge into lane one, but encountered the construction cones and tried to merge back into lane two. This sudden lane change and failure to bring the vehicle to a controlled stop in lane one resulted in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 also admitted to feeling pressure from work and having the important sales account on her mind while driving. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to observe the work zone signs and traffic cones make her primarily responsible for the collision.
