The reason for V2's responsibility is that the driver of V2 was traveling too fast for the conditions, went partially off the road on the right side, and then overcompensated by veering across the road and off the left side. This resulted in V2 colliding with V1 when re-entering the roadway. The driver's inattention, thought focus unknown, and driver inexperience were also contributing factors.
