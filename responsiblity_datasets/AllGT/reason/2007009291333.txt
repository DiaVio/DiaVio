The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect lane change without adequately checking for other vehicles in the adjacent lane. V1 intended to make a U-turn at the next crossover and signaled the lane change to the left. However, V1 failed to properly observe the presence of V2 (the 2006 Lincoln Navigator) traveling in lane two at the same speed. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 crossing into lane two and colliding with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes is the primary reason for the accident.
