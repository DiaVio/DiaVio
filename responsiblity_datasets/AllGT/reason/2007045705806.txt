The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to see V1 (the 1998 Toyota Corolla) approaching in the westbound lane. V2's view was obstructed, and although the driver looked, she did not see V1 due to the traffic flow and sightline restrictions. Additionally, V2 falsely assumed that it was safe to turn based on another motorist waving her out. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn resulted in the collision with V1, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
