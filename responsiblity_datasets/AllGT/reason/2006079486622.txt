The reason for this is that V2's critical reason for the event was attributed to a driver-related factor: inadequate surveillance. The driver of V2 reported that her view of northbound crossing traffic was blocked by a large truck that was slightly ahead and to her left. Additionally, she mentioned that she did not see V1's approach prior to the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to adequately survey the intersection and be aware of V1's presence resulted in the collision, making V2 primarily responsible.
