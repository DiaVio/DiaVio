The driver of Vehicle #1 encountered a slower moving vehicle in the right lane and overreacted by steering right to the shoulder. This overcompensation caused the driver to lose control and depart the road, resulting in the collision with the fence and trees. The driver's fatigue, with only four hours of sleep, may have contributed to the performance error and failure to look far enough ahead.
