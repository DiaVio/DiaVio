The driver of V1 failed to use due care by following too closely to respond to the actions of others and being unfamiliar with the roadway and weather conditions. This resulted in V1 being unable to stop in time when traffic in lane four came to a stop due to heavy rain and low visibility. V1 then swerved into lane five, colliding with V2, and was subsequently hit by V3 when it was pushed back into lane four.
