The reason for assigning primary responsibility to Vehicle #1 is that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before attempting to cross. The driver stated that he looked right then left, but did not see any traffic. However, he failed to notice Vehicle #2 (the 1996 Dodge Neon) approaching from his right on the highway. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to Vehicle #1 crossing the intersection and ultimately causing the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of Vehicle #1 was aware of the intersection's danger and typically avoids crossing it during weekday morning rush hour. However, he decided to cross on the weekend, assuming that traffic would be lighter. This decision, combined with the driver's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic, contributed to the accident. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance, as well as the decision to cross the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic.
