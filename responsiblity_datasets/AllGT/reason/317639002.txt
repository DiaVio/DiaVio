The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right while negotiating a left curve, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's unsuccessful attempt to steer V1 back onto the roadway suggests a lack of proper handling or reaction to the situation. This ultimately led to V1 contacting an embankment, rolling over, and causing severe injuries to the driver.
