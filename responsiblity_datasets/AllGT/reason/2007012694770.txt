The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they turned left into the path of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Buick Regal) without ensuring that the roadway was clear. V1 stated that they did not see any vehicles coming from the southbound direction before making the left turn. This indicates a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and exercise caution while turning. Additionally, V1's obstructed view due to the van waiting to turn left into the shopping center and the SUV waiting to turn left into the southbound lanes can be considered as contributing factors. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to do so. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in lane one and had the right of way. They were passing the van in lane two when V1 turned left into their path. V2 stated that they did not have time to react, indicating that they were not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and ensure that it was safe to make the left turn.
