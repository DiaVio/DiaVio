The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others." This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the conditions, specifically the heavy traffic and the fact that V2 had stopped. Despite being familiar with the route and well-rested, V1 was unable to respond in time to avoid colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust their speed to the traffic conditions and their inability to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 make them primarily responsible for the accident.
