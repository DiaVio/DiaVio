The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he made an illegal left turn onto a street where left turns were prohibited. Despite the presence of a sign stating "No left turns," V1 failed to notice it and proceeded to make the left turn when the light turned green. This action directly led to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1995 Chevrolet Blazer) who was already in the intersection and had the right-of-way. Additionally, V1's claim of being distracted by a young lady standing on the corner of the intersection further highlights his lack of attention and negligence in following traffic rules.
