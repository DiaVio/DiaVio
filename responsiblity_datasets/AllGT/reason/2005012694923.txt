The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high speed of 53 mph (according to the locked odometer) in a residential area with a speed limit of 25 mph. Additionally, the driver admitted to being a heavy-footed driver and stated that he was in a hurry to get home to rest. These factors indicate a disregard for the speed limit and a lack of attention to the road conditions. Furthermore, the driver's fatigue, inattention, conversation with the passenger, and unfamiliarity with the roadway contribute to his primary responsibility. These factors impaired his ability to properly navigate the sharp left curve, resulting in him realizing he was going too fast and attempting to brake and steer left at the last moment. However, these actions were not enough to prevent the vehicle from skidding off the road and colliding with a utility pole. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to excessive speed, driver behavior, and failure to adapt to the roadway conditions.
