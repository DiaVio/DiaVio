Reason: The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 is coded as "this vehicle traveling: crossing over (passing through) intersection" and the critical reason for this event is coded as "driver related factor: inattention." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not paying attention while crossing the intersection, which led to the collision with Vehicle 2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was fatigued due to lack of sleep and nutrition, which could have further impaired their ability to drive safely.
