The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This indicates that V2 was stopped in the lane due to the traffic ahead, but V1 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) was unable to avoid the crash and struck the rear of V2. Although V1 did not attempt to avoid V2, it is important to note that V2 was stopped in the lane, creating a potential hazard for other vehicles. V2 should have been more cautious and aware of the traffic conditions, especially considering that the driver was aware of the previous crash and the resulting traffic stoppage. Therefore, V2 bears primary responsibility for the accident.
