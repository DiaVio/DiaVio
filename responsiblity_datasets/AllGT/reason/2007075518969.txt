The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down at his glasses inside the car, which caused him to not notice that traffic had come to a stop at the intersection. As a result, V1 was unable to brake in time and collided with the rear of V2 (the Nissan Pathfinder), causing a chain reaction that led to V2 colliding with the rear of V3 (the Jeep Grand Cherokee). The driver of V2 was stopped at the intersection, following the flow of traffic, and there is no indication that they were at fault or contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper surveillance of the road ahead.
