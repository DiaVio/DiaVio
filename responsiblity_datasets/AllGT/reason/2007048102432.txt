The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not realizing that V2 and V3 were stopping. This internal distraction caused V1 to collide with the back of V2, which then caused a chain reaction resulting in V2 colliding with the back of V3. Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention and adjust their driving behavior accordingly makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
