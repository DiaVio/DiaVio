The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to running a red light. The driver stated that the light turned from yellow to red just as she was about to enter the intersection. However, based on the timing of the lights, it can be determined that the northbound traffic control/light would have been red for at least thirty seconds if eastbound traffic had a green light. This indicates that V1 failed to stop at a red light, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's driver was coded as being inattentive and failing to look far enough ahead to notice the red light. The driver was also coded as completing an illegal maneuver by violating a traffic control device. The driver's inattention was attributed to being upset, possibly due to her mother's condition. However, personal problems cannot justify running a red light and causing an accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to running a red light and failing to exercise proper attention and caution while driving.
