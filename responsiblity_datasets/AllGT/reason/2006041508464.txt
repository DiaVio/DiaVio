The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to the vehicle in front of it and was unable to respond to the sudden slowing of traffic. The driver's claim that a motorcycle cut him off was not supported by any evidence, and it is believed that the driver's own actions of following too closely led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the concrete barrier wall.
