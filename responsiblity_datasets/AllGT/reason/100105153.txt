The reason for this is that the driver of the non-contact vehicle had to "panic stop" in order to avoid stopped traffic, which caused them to partially encroach into the number-two lane and into the path of the case vehicle. This sudden maneuver forced the driver of the case vehicle to steer to the right and apply the brakes in an attempt to avoid a collision. As a result, the case vehicle exited the roadway and subsequently collided with various objects, leading to disabling damage and injuries to the occupants.
