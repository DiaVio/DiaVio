The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by pulling into the westbound travel lane in an attempt to bypass the traffic and reach the turning lane. This maneuver was not allowed and resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she never saw the other vehicle and attributed it to the sun being in her eyes. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure clear visibility before making any maneuvers on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the illegal maneuver and failure to exercise caution while changing lanes.
