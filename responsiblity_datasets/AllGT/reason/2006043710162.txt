The driver of V1 failed to stop for a red light and admitted to being distracted by her son in the back seat. She was not paying attention to the road or the traffic control signals, and only noticed the red light when she looked up. This indicates inadequate surveillance and an illegal maneuver on the part of the driver of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop for a red light and being distracted by her son.
