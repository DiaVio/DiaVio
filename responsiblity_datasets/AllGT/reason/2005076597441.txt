The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2. The driver of V1 admitted that he misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, indicating a driver-related factor. Additionally, V1's failure to obey the traffic control device (stop sign) and inadequate surveillance were considered associative factors. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and misjudgment of the oncoming vehicle's speed make them primarily responsible for the accident.
