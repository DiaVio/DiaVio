The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver failed to negotiate the curvature of the interchange and steered right, causing the vehicle to travel off the left roadside. This resulted in V1 narrowly missing a guardrail, striking a tree branch with its left A-pillar, and ultimately descending the embankment and striking the ground. The driver's failure to properly navigate the interchange and stay on the roadway led to the accident.
