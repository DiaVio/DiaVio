The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding into it. This is evident from the fact that V2 stated that V1 appeared out of nowhere and that she had no time to react. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surroundings before making the left turn. On the other hand, V1, although admitting to looking left where she intended to turn, entered the intersection when the light was yellow, indicating that she had the right of way. Therefore, V1's actions can be considered within the normal course of traffic flow. In conclusion, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and proceed with caution makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
