The driver of V1, while waiting for her traffic signal to turn green, allegedly did not adequately surveil the intersection before making her left turn. This is evident from the Critical Precrash Event being coded as "this vehicle turning left at intersection" and the Critical Reason being coded as "inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see)." Even though the driver of V2 was talking on his mobile phone at the time of the accident, it is mentioned that his traffic signal was green and he did not slow down before colliding with V1 because he never saw it. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and V1 failed to yield while making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while making the left turn.
