The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before pulling out from the parking space. This recognition error led to the driver of V2 not seeing V1 approaching, resulting in the collision. Although it is mentioned that V1 was traveling too fast for a parking lot, it is not believed to be the reason for the driver of V2 not seeing V1. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V2 for inadequate surveillance.
