The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not look far enough ahead before reaching the end of the ramp. This resulted in V1 not noticing that V2 (the minivan) had come to a stop in the road in front of her. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look ahead contributed to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 failed to properly defrost her vehicle before starting her morning commute, which could have impaired her visibility and further contributed to the accident. While V2 is also mentioned to have contributed to the accident by assuming that V1 would merge without stopping, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the road ahead and reacting in time to avoid the collision.
