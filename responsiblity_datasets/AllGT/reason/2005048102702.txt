The reason for this is that V1's driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle after successfully avoiding a collision with a non-contact vehicle that pulled out in front of them. As a result, V1 crossed over multiple lanes and the center median, ultimately colliding with V2 (the driver of the 1991 Oldsmobile 98 sedan) in the oncoming traffic. V1's lack of control and subsequent actions led to the accident.
