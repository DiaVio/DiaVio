The driver of V2 admitted to accidentally applying the accelerator instead of the brake, resulting in a loss of control and colliding with V1 (the Dodge Caravan). Additionally, the driver of V2 was an inexperienced driver, having only been driving for 6 months. This lack of experience likely contributed to the poor directional control and inability to correct the loss of control.
