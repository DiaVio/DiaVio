The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a sudden left turn directly in front of V2 (the Honda Civic), causing the collision. The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road before making the left turn, which is considered a driver-related error. This action violated the right of way of V2, who was traveling in the correct lane and did not have time to take any avoidance actions.
