The reason for V1's responsibility is that they lost control of their vehicle on the icy and slushy road surface. This loss of control caused V1 to spin counterclockwise into the westbound lane, directly in the path of V2. V1's inability to regain control of their vehicle contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with their passenger, which may have further impaired their ability to maintain control of the vehicle.
