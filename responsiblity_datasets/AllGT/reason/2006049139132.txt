The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, failing to stop at the stop sign. The driver's inattention, due to having a conversation with the passenger about directions, diverted her attention from the driving task. She failed to observe V2 to her left or the cyclist crossing the road. Additionally, the driver mentioned that there was sun glare reflecting off the roadway at the time, which may have further impaired her visibility.
