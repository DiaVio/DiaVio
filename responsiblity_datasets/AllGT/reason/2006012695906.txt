The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle and cross the left lane line. This resulted in the collision with V2 (the Pontiac Aztec) that was traveling in the opposite direction. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's driver was an inexperienced 17-year old and may have been in a hurry, which could have contributed to their decision to drive too fast for the conditions. Therefore, V1's primary responsibility for the accident is due to their excessive speed and failure to adapt to the icy road conditions.
