The reason for this is that the driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep while driving, causing V1 to cross the centerline and enter the northbound lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two (V2 - case vehicle). Falling asleep while driving is a negligent act and a violation of traffic laws, as it impairs the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their designated lane. Therefore, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
