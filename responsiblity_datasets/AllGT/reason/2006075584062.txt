The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they ran a stop sign and entered the intersection at the same time as V2 (the fire truck) was passing through. This indicates a failure to yield the right of way and a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, V1 was reported to be driving at a high speed of 80 kmph (50 mph) in a 48 kmph (30 mph) speed zone, which further demonstrates reckless and aggressive driving behavior. V2, the fire truck driver, was responding to a 911 call with lights activated and was not in a hurry. They were driving within the speed limit and taking appropriate measures to respond to the emergency. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute to the primary responsibility for the accident.
