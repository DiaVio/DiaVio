The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 1995 Chevrolet Silverado). V1 stated that the traffic in the second and third lane stopped to let him turn, but he could not see V2. This indicates that V1 did not properly assess the situation and failed to yield the right of way to V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
