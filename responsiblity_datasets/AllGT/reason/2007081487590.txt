V1 initiated a left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically V2, which was traveling in the opposite direction. This action by V1 resulted in V2 colliding with the front right corner of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
