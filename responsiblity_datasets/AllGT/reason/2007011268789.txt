The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2003 Kia Sedona mini-van) who had the flashing yellow light. V1 stopped briefly at the blinking red light, saw V2 approaching from her right, and proceeded across the intersection assuming that V2 also had a red blinking light. This false assumption of V2's actions led to V1's failure to yield, resulting in the collision. Additionally, contributing factors on the part of V1 include her unfamiliarity with the signal lights/intersection late at night, her fatigue from being awake for 17 hours, and her sleep schedule shift. These factors may have impaired her judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the accident. It is important to note that V2 also had a contributing factor, which was not following his normal sleeping habits. However, V2's actions alone would not have caused the accident if V1 had yielded the right of way as required. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way to V2.
