The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the severe impact occurred on the right side of the vehicle, indicating that V1 was the one that collided with the utility pole. Additionally, the description of the occupant's movement during the crash suggests that she made contact with the right front seat back and the intruding utility pole, further indicating that V1 was involved in the collision. It is important to note that this determination is based solely on the information provided in the case summary and may be subject to change or further investigation.
