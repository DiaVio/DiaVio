The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2, who was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's view was obstructed by parked vehicles along the east curb, but it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the intersection is clear before making a left turn. Additionally, V1 fled the scene after the collision, which is a violation of the law and shows a lack of responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to yield the right of way and leaving the scene of the accident.
