The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before pulling out of the driveway. The driver of V1 stated that she looked right and then left, but did not see V2 approaching in lane one on the roadway. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 pulling out quickly and directly into the path of V2. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1's age and the possible side effects of the prescribed medication taken for arthritis and cholesterol may have contributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 approaching. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly survey the intersection and yield the right of way to V2.
