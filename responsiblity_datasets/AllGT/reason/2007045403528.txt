The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control. The driver reported that she saw a vehicle coming from the opposite direction and moved to the right to avoid it. However, she lost control of the vehicle and it went off the right side of the road, ultimately colliding with a utility pole. The driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle indicates a lack of proper handling and control, leading to the crash.
