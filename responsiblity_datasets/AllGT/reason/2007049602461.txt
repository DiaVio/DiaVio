The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were traveling the wrong way on a one-way street, which is an illegal maneuver. This is supported by the driver's own statement that they were confused by the traffic layout and took the wrong turn despite using a GPS unit. Additionally, V1's vehicle impacted both V2 and V3, indicating that they were the one initiating the collision.
