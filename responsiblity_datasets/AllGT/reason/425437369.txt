The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling straight on the roadway, while Vehicle 2 (the 2011 Toyota Prius intermediate size sedan) was preparing to turn left. Vehicle 1 impacted the front of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was already in the process of making a left turn. This failure to yield resulted in the head-on collision between the two vehicles.
