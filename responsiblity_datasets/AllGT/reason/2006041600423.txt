The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was on her cell phone while waiting to make a u-turn in lane four. She admitted that she misjudged the distance and speed of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Toyota Corolla) and froze up when she saw his car approaching the intersection. This resulted in her pulling into the intersection and stopping abruptly, causing the collision with V2. V2 stated that he tried to avoid her, but it was too late. Therefore, V1's distracted driving, misjudgment of speed, and freezing up in the intersection are the factors that make her primarily responsible for the crash.
