The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right pavement edge and entered an open field, causing it to travel laterally and dig into the soft soil. This tripping mechanism initiated a left side rollover, resulting in moderate top damage. The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart the pavement edge, indicating a lack of control or failure to maintain the vehicle within the roadway. Additionally, no airbags deployed in Vehicle 1, suggesting that the accident was not caused by a collision with another vehicle or external factor. Furthermore, the unrestrained front right passenger of Vehicle 1 suffered serious injuries during the rollover. The lack of restraint use was confirmed by the absence of loading evidence on the front right seat belt system. The passenger's trajectory towards the left and impact with the steering wheel rim indicate that the lack of restraint contributed to the severity of their injuries. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control and the unrestrained passenger's injuries resulting from the rollover.
