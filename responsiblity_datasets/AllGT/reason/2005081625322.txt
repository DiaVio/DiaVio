The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that initiated the collision by swerving left to avoid a large rock in its travel lane. This action caused V1 to leave its travel lane and collide with the right side front of Vehicle two (V2). V2, on the other hand, was traveling in its designated lane and did not encroach into the lane of V1. Therefore, V1's poor directional control and decision to swerve into another lane led to the accident.
