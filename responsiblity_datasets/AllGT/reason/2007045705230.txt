The reason for this is that V1 was turning left from a private drive onto the east/west primary arterial, and evidence at the scene indicated that there was a tractor-trailer parked on the right/south shoulder in front of the convenience store, effectively blocking the line of sight between the eastbound travel lanes and the driveway. This sightline restriction caused by the parked tractor-trailer was coded as an associated factor for V1. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately assess the oncoming traffic due to the obstructed view contributed to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
