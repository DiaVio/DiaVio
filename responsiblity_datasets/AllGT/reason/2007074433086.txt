The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the critical pre-crash event, V2's critical reason for the event was a "driver related factor; false assumption of other's actions." V2 assumed that V1 would stop, but V1 did not, resulting in the collision. While V1's false assumption of V2's actions was an associated factor in the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V2 as they were the one making the left turn and failed to accurately assess the situation and the actions of the oncoming vehicle.
