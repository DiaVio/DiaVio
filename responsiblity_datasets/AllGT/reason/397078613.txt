The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection without yielding to V1 (2002 Lexus GS 300) which was already traveling in the proper lane. V2 struck V1 in the right front fender, causing V1 to rotate and resulting in a side-slap impact between the two vehicles. This initial collision was caused by V2's failure to yield at the stop sign controlling the westbound traffic. Additionally, after the side-slap impact, V1 continued forward and crossed the centerline directly into the path of V3 (2001 Ford F-250). This head-on impact between V1 and V3 was a result of V1's loss of control due to the initial collision with V2. Therefore, V2's failure to yield at the stop sign and enter the intersection without caution makes it primarily responsible for the crash.
