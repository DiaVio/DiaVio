The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound in the number-one lane (right) with the intention of traveling straight through the intersection. V1, the 2006 Ford Mustang 2-door sedan, was negotiating a left turn at the appropriate time. V2 entered the intersection simultaneously and struck the left side of V1 forward of the B-pillar area. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
