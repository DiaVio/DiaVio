The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that veered off the road and into the gore area, ultimately colliding with the impact attenuator. The witness statement and physical evidence suggest that V1 missed the exit and was attempting to exit the freeway across the gore. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as poor directional control, indicating that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2006 Ford Ranger) stated that he did not see V1 until it hit the barrier and spun around. There is no indication that V2 was involved in the first harmful event or contributed to the crash. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to control the vehicle and their actions leading to the collision with the impact attenuator.
