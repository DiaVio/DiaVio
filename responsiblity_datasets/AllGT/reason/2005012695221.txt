The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were pulling out of a commercial drive and slipped on some ice in the roadway. V1 did not see V2 pulling out until they were right in front of them due to a pile of snow on the side of the roadway blocking their view. V1's vehicle was hit by V2's vehicle in the left rear, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1's recognition error and inadequate surveillance contributed to the crash.
