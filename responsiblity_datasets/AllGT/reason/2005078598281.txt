The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn into the shopping mall and failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V1 did not see V2 (the 2000 Ford Ranger) approaching from the opposite direction and turned left in front of V2, causing the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 did not stop at the intersection before making the turn, further indicating their failure to exercise proper caution and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
