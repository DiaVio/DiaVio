The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection while V2, the 2001 Buick Century sedan, was continuing straight. V1's front impacted the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
