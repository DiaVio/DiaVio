The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they traveled off the right side of the roadway, lost control, and then crossed the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating that V1's actions led to the crash. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; internal distraction." This suggests that the driver of V1 was distracted, which likely contributed to their loss of control and subsequent collision with V2. Furthermore, the associated factors of V1's speed (traveling at approximately 89 kmph) and the driver's inexperience (having been driving for only one year) were also identified as contributing factors in this crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
