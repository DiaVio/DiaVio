The reason for V1's responsibility is that it traveled to the right and struck the back of V2 (the parked Chevrolet G2500 van). This indicates that V1 veered out of its lane and failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the police report states that the driver of V1 was under the influence of drugs, which further supports V1's responsibility for the accident.
