The reason for this is that V2 left the roadway for an unknown reason, entered the grass median, and collided with the guard cable wire. V2 then entered the northbound lanes in a jackknife position, causing V1, the Toyota Prius, to collide with the left side of V2. The impact caused V1 to roll over multiple times and come to rest in the opposite direction. V2 continued to slide laterally and collided with the front of Vehicle Three (V3), causing it to roll over as well. Therefore, V2's initial departure from the roadway and subsequent actions led to the chain of events that resulted in the accident.
