The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by the children in the vehicle, which caused her to turn around and not notice that the vehicle in front of her was stopped. This distraction and failure to pay attention to the road ahead led to V1 colliding with the back of V2 (1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass), which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3 (2000 Ford Expedition). Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her are the main reasons for the crash.
