The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. The driver's overcompensation while fishtailing further contributed to the loss of control. These factors, along with the wet roads and rainy weather, were associated factors coded to the driver of V1. V2 (the 2006 Kenwood dump truck) was traveling in the adjacent lane and was unable to change lanes due to surrounding traffic. The driver of V2 was tracking V1 and was not at fault for the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was the encroachment of V1 into its lane. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control and overcompensation, while V2 was not at fault.
