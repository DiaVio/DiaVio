The driver of V2 stated that she braked in order to change lanes and make the next exit. This sudden braking action caused V1 to collide with the back left bumper of V2. Additionally, it was determined that V2 had ABS, which would not allow the driver to lock up the brakes hard enough to create smoke, contradicting the witness statement that V2 locked up its brakes. Therefore, V2's sudden braking and decision to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so contributed to the crash.
