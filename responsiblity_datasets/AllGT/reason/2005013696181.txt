The driver of V1 saw a deer approaching the right side of the roadway and overcompensated by steering hard to the left. This resulted in the driver losing control of the vehicle and crossing the left lane, ultimately striking the guardrail on the east side of the road. The critical event for V1 is coded as an animal approaching the roadway, and the critical reason is a performance error (overcompensation). Additionally, the associating factor of slick roads (wet) contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
