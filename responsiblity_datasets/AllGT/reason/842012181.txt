The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the pavement edge, resulting in a sideswipe impact with a small tree and subsequent impact with a large tree. The driver was unrestrained, which contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. Additionally, the lack of restraint usage caused the front restraints to be locked in the stowed position, further compromising the safety of the driver.
