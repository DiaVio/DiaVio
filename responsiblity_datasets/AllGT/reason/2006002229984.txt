The Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #1 indicates that the driver made a left turn at an intersection, which was the critical event leading to the crash. The Critical Reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of other vehicles. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to accurately assess the distance and speed of Vehicle #2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 refused an interview and inspection of her vehicle, which may indicate a lack of cooperation or potential negligence on her part. On the other hand, the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #2 indicates that there was another motor vehicle in the lane, in a crossover. However, the Critical Reason for this event was not coded for Vehicle #2, suggesting that the driver of Vehicle #2 may not have contributed significantly to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2 while making a left turn.
