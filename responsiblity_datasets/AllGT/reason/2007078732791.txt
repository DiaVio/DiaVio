The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, disregarding the traffic signal. This illegal maneuver of disregarding the traffic signal is a driver-related factor that contributed to the accident. V2 (the driver of the Ford F-350 pickup) stated that he was slowing down while entering the intersection on a green light and tried to avoid V1, but it was too late. Therefore, V2's actions were in accordance with traffic laws and he was not primarily responsible for the accident.
