The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she executed a U-turn from a parked position without adequately surveilling the traffic behind her. She reported that she checked her mirrors but did not see V2's approach. This indicates a failure on her part to properly assess the traffic conditions before making the U-turn. Additionally, the critical precrash event for V1 was that she was traveling over the lane line on the left side. This suggests that she may not have been maintaining proper lane discipline, which further contributes to her responsibility for the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) saw V1 execute the turn unexpectedly and attempted to brake with full lockup. He also sounded the horn to alert V1. These actions indicate that V2 reacted appropriately to the situation and attempted to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to inadequate surveillance and improper lane discipline.
