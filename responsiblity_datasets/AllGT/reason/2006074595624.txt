The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event being coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." Additionally, the driver admitted to being in a hurry and not being comfortable with the vehicle due to oversized tires. The driver also mentioned having smoked marijuana earlier, which could have impaired their judgment and driving abilities. Overall, the driver's poor directional control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, combined with the factors of speeding and potential impairment, indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
