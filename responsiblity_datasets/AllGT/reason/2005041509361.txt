The driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by attempting to make a u-turn in the intersection, despite there being a clearly posted "No U-Turn" sign. The driver falsely assumed that all southbound traffic was coming to a halt, which was a decision error. This false assumption led to the driver not seeing or hearing V2 (the Ford Explorer) until impact. While V2 did not take sufficient evasive action to avoid the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an illegal maneuver and falsely assuming the actions of other drivers.
