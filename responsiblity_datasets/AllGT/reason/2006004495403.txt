The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 74-year-old male, was under the influence of an unspecified medication and alcohol at the time of the accident. The driver's legal counsel reported that the driver swerved right and struck the pole due to being incoherent, disoriented, and under the influence. Additionally, a witness stated that V1 was swerving from left to right and nearly striking oncoming traffic before losing control and hitting the utility pole. These factors indicate that the driver's poor directional control, caused by the influence of substances, was the critical reason for the accident.
