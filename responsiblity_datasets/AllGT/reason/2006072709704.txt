The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling - turning left at intersection," indicating that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection. The critical reason for V2 was coded as "type of driver error unknown," suggesting that V2 may have made an error while executing the left turn. Without further information about V1 (the unknown vehicle), it is difficult to determine its level of responsibility in the accident. However, since V2 was making a left turn, it is generally expected that the turning vehicle yields to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V2 is considered primarily responsible for the collision.
