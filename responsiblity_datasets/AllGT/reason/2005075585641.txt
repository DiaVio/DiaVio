The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the traffic in lane one before making a lane change. This is evident from the fact that V1 entered lane one in front of V2 without checking the mirrors to see if any traffic was present. As a result, V2, which was traveling at a lower steady speed in lane one, was unable to avoid the collision and ended up impacting the back of V1. In summary, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look for traffic in lane one before making a lane change led to the accident.
