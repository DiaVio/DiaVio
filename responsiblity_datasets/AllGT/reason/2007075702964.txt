The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver turned left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver stated that he was unable to see clearly around a pickup truck stopped in lane three going southbound, which resulted in him not seeing V2 (the 1996 Pontiac Grand Am) until right before impact. Additionally, the driver mentioned that his brakes were not as responsive due to the cold weather. While V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Grand Am) also mentioned not seeing V1 due to a large truck stopped in lane three, V1's failure to yield the right of way and turn left without a clear view is the primary contributing factor to the accident.
