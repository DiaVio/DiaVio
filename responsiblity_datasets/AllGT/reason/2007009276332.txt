The driver of V1 failed to recognize that traffic ahead had completely stopped, leading to the collision with the stationary V2. The driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to look far enough ahead, combined with traveling too fast for the wet conditions, contributed to the accident. Additionally, the low tread and underinflated tires of V1 may have further compromised its ability to stop on the wet roadway. While distractions from conversations in the vehicle could have played a role, the driver of V1 ultimately bears responsibility for not maintaining proper awareness of the road conditions and failing to react in time to avoid the collision.
