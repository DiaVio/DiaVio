The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by talking to and looking at his wife just before the crash. This distraction caused him to fail to adequately surveil the road ahead and make a false assumption that the driver of V2 would continue to proceed. As a result, V1 steered to the right to avoid a collision but was unable to clear the lane, leading to the impact with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to properly assess the situation and react in a timely manner make them primarily responsible for the accident.
