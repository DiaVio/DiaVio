The reason for this is that V1 was making a left-hand turn from the intersecting street and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Mazda Protégé) traveling eastbound in lane two. V1's occupants admitted to creeping into the intersection without properly ensuring it was safe to proceed with the left turn. This action resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, the presence of marijuana and drug-related factors in V1 suggests that the driver may have been impaired or distracted, contributing to their failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and potential impairment/distracted driving make them primarily responsible for the crash.
