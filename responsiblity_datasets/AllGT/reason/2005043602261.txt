The reason for this is that V1 made an illegal left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Dodge Ram 2500), causing the initial collision between the two vehicles. This illegal maneuver by V1 directly led to the subsequent collisions involving V2, V3, V4, and V5. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1 was cited for driving under the influence of an unknown substance, which further supports their responsibility for the accident.
