The reason for this is that V1 was reported to be traveling at a high rate of speed and was fleeing an earlier incident. This aggressive driving behavior indicates a disregard for traffic laws and safety, which likely contributed to the collision. Additionally, V1 was crossing through the intersection, suggesting that they failed to yield the right of way to V2. While V2 (the driver of the 1995 Geo Prizm) proceeded through the intersection with a green traffic signal, they stated that they never saw V1 prior to the crash. This indicates that V2 likely had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their aggressive driving behavior and failure to yield the right of way.
