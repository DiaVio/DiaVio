The driver of Vehicle #1 veered into the eastbound lanes, impacting a legally parked and unoccupied Ford E-Series Van. The driver stated that she attempted to stop but accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake pedal. This indicates a driver-related factor of poor directional control, failing to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver was issued a citation for being an unlicensed operator. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and unlicensed status.
