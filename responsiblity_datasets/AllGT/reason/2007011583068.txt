The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to take appropriate evasive action when she saw the object in her lane. Instead of successfully avoiding the object, V1 struck it and then overcorrected, causing the vehicle to go off the road and flip onto its roof. The driver's choice of an inappropriate and unsuccessful evasive action, along with the possible distraction of thinking about a future event, contributed to the accident.
