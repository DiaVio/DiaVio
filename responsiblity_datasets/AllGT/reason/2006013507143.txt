The reason for this is that V1 was exiting a driveway on the south side of the road and attempting to turn left. The vehicles in the curb lane were waving for V1 to go, and V1 pulled out to complete the left turn without adequately surveilling the left travel lane. This failure to look before entering the left travel lane is coded as "drivers inadequate surveillance" and is considered the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. On the other hand, V2 (the 1999 Oldsmobile Cutlass) was traveling in the left lane headed east and had the right of way. V2 stated that V1 came from her right into her lane, and she tried to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and turning to the left. However, since V1 failed to properly observe the traffic and entered the left lane in the path of V2, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
