The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two misjudged the speed of Vehicle one and turned left at the intersection, causing Vehicle one to collide with the rear of Vehicle two. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to the driver of Vehicle two, stating "driver related factor: misjudgment of gap or other's speed". Therefore, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's misjudgment of the speed of Vehicle one while making a left turn at the intersection.
