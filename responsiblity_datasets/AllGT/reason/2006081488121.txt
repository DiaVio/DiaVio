The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 encroached into V2's lane of travel while making a right turn from a driveway. The driver of V1 misjudged V2's speed and distance, and failed to adequately surveil the traffic before pulling out. Additionally, the driver of V1 was potentially distracted by being on a cell phone, which further contributed to the encroachment into V2's lane.
