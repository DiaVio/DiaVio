The reason for V2's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by external factors, specifically being frightened by individuals approaching her vehicle and watching behind her to see if she was being followed. This distraction likely caused her to not notice V1 approaching and resulted in her failure to yield the right of way to the ambulance. Additionally, V2 did not have her vehicle's headlights on, which could have contributed to the lack of visibility for both drivers in the dark and wet conditions.
