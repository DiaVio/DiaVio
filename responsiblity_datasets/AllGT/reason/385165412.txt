The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 experienced a loss of control while negotiating the curved section of the roadway, causing it to depart the right side of the roadway and subsequently over-steer left. This resulted in Vehicle 2 crossing back across the roadway and into the path of Vehicle 1 (the 2008 Ford Mustang 2-door coupe), which was traveling in the southbound lane. Vehicle 1 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and entering the paved shoulder area, but was unsuccessful in doing so. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 in losing control and crossing into the path of Vehicle 1 are the primary cause of the accident.
