The driver of V1, an 87-year-old female, mistakenly applied the accelerator instead of the brake, causing her vehicle to collide with the back of V2 (the 2003 Ford Focus station wagon). This initial impact then led to a chain reaction, with V2 being pushed into the back of V3 (the 1995 Dodge Caravan), and V3 subsequently impacting the back of V4 (the 2000 Ford Crown Victoria sedan). The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver's poor directional control, specifically the failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. The driver's confusion regarding the placement of her foot on the brake pedal resulted in her unintentionally accelerating instead of braking, leading to the collision.
