The reason for this is that V2 failed to maintain proper surveillance and did not notice that traffic ahead had slowed down and stopped. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical event being coded as "inadequate surveillance - failed to look, looked but did not see." Additionally, evidence at the scene indicated that V2 applied her brakes with lock-up, suggesting a lack of awareness and reaction time. While V1, the driver of the Chevy pickup, did slow down due to the traffic ahead, there is no evidence to suggest that she was at fault for the accident. V1 was rear-ended by V2, indicating that V2 was following too closely and failed to stop in time. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to maintain proper surveillance and react appropriately to the traffic conditions.
