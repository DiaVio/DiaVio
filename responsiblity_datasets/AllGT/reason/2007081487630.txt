The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. Instead of staying in their lane, V1 steered to the right to avoid the school bus, causing them to depart the roadway and enter the drainage ditch. Additionally, the driver's decision to hit the accelerator harder while bouncing in the ditch further contributed to the loss of control. Ultimately, V1 collided with a tree, resulting in damage to the vehicle. Therefore, V1's poor directional control and failure to navigate the curve safely led to the accident, making them primarily responsible.
