The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the right into the merge lane and struck a guardrail end, causing it to rotate and ultimately collide with V2 (the 2008 Toyota Scion). V1's initial drift and collision with the guardrail indicates a failure to maintain proper control and stay within the designated lane, leading to the subsequent collision with V2.
