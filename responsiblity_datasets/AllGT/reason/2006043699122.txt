The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to realize that his road terminated at the intersection and proceeded to cross over at the same time as V2 (the Infiniti I30). This indicates a lack of awareness and failure to yield the right of way. Additionally, V1's driver was distracted by checking messages on his cell phone, which further contributed to his failure to notice the end of the roadway and the presence of V2. Furthermore, V1's driver stated that there was no adequate signage indicating the end of the roadway. However, the presence of two stop signs for his lane of travel should have alerted him to the need to stop and yield to oncoming traffic. Overall, V1's driver's lack of familiarity with the area, distraction from cell phone use, failure to yield, and failure to notice the stop signs make him primarily responsible for the accident.
