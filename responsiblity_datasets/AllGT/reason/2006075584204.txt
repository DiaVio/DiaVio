The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted internally, as indicated by the Critical Pre-Crash Reason being coded as "driver related factor, Internal distraction." The driver admitted to looking down at the speedometer when the non-contact vehicle flashed their headlights, which caused her to take her eyes off the road. As a result, she did not have enough time to react and avoid hitting the elk in the roadway. Additionally, the driver mentioned that she was not comfortable driving on this dark roadway at night, which suggests a lack of attentiveness and preparedness for potential hazards.
