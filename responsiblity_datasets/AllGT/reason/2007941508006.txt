The driver of V1 was intoxicated with a high BAC level of .167, which impaired his ability to act and make proper decisions while driving. He admitted to consuming six beers and a bottle of wine prior to the crash, which likely contributed to his blackout and lack of recollection of the events. This indicates a critical non-performance error on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver was suffering from alcoholism and depression, which could have further impaired his judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. Furthermore, the driver attempted to negotiate the curve at a speed greater than the posted speed limit for the curve. The police reported travel speed for V1 was 56 kmph, which was significantly higher than the advisory speed limit of 24 kmph. This suggests that the driver was driving recklessly and at an unsafe speed for the road conditions. Although there were some roadway-related factors, such as the lack of lane markings due to recent repaving and the driver's unfamiliarity with the area, these factors do not absolve the driver of responsibility. The primary cause of the crash was the driver's impaired state due to alcohol consumption and his failure to adhere to the speed limit.
