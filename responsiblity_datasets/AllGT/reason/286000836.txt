The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection after the stop sign without yielding the right of way to V1, which was already traveling on the intersecting road. This failure to yield resulted in the front plane of V2 impacting the left side plane of V1, causing the collision and subsequent injuries to the occupants of V1.
