The reason for this is inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). The driver of V2 stated that he waited about 5 seconds before pulling out of his driveway and did not see any vehicles approaching. This lack of proper surveillance led to the collision with V1 (the Volvo station wagon) as it was traveling past the driveway.
