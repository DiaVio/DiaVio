The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver did not look or failed to see the oncoming V2 motorcycle. This lack of attention and failure to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic led to the collision. While V2 (the motorcycle driver) also had an associated factor in the crash, which was assuming that V1 would stop or slow down, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic.
