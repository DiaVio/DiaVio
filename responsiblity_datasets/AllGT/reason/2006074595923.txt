The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of 0.25, which impaired their ability to operate the vehicle safely. The driver admitted to not seeing the other car at all and even passed out while driving. This level of impairment and negligence directly contributed to the collision.
