The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver had recently discontinued the use of a medication for preventing seizures, at the recommendation of his doctor. The driver had been diagnosed with epilepsy, and although he had not had a seizure recently, the discontinuation of the medication likely impaired his ability to act and control the vehicle properly. This physical impairment of the ability to act resulted in V1 traveling off the right side of the roadway and colliding with the trees.
