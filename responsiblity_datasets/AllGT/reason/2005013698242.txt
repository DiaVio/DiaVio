The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road before pulling out from the public driveway. The driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 due to the stopped vehicles blocking her view. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and caution on the part of V1. Additionally, V1 attempted to make a left turn onto the road without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in a collision with V2. It is important to note that V2's driver fled the scene of the crash, which is a separate offense. However, in terms of responsibility for the accident itself, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible.
