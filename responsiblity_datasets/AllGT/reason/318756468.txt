The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling north and negotiating a left curve on a suburban road. It failed to yield to Vehicle 2 (2004 Toyota Camry) which was stopped and waiting to turn left at the forked intersection. As a result, the two vehicles collided head-on, leading to the subsequent rotation and side-slap impact.
