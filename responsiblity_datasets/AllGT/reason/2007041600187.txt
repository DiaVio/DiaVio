The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way and turned in front of V2. The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the speed and distance of V2, indicating a driver error. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway due to being on vacation may have contributed to the misjudgment. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and misjudgment of the oncoming vehicle's speed and distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
