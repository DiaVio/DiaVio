The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the critical pre-crash event coding, the driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their misjudgment and failure to yield while making a left turn.
