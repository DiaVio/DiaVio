The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn. Despite not having a green arrow, V1 proceeded to make the left turn without noticing V2 (the 2005 Hyundai Elantra) approaching in the southbound lanes. This failure to see the oncoming vehicle and properly assess the traffic situation led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was running late for a business appointment and may not have been paying as much attention to the road as she normally would. This further supports the argument that V1's lack of attention and failure to properly observe the traffic conditions contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure to yield the right of way and not properly observing the oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
