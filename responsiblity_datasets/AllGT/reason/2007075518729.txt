The driver of V1 was distracted by an infant passenger, which caused him to drift into the adjacent travel lane and collide with the back of V2 (the 1996 Ford Bronco). The distraction further intensified when the airbags deployed upon impact, blocking the driver's view of forward traffic. The driver of V1 also had a history of prior collisions and may have mistakenly hit the accelerator instead of the gas pedal. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not fully focused on the driving task and failed to maintain control of their vehicle, resulting in the chain reaction of collisions.
