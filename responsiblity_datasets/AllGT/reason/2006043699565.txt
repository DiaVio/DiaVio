The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at an intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Nissan Maxima) which was traveling straight in the westbound lane. V2 had the right of way and was unable to avoid the collision even after braking. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's tread depth for two of the tires was minimal, which could have contributed to reduced traction and control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and potential issues with tire tread depth make them primarily responsible for the accident.
