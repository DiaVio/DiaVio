The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the rainy wet conditions, which caused the vehicle to lose traction and fishtail. The driver then made an inappropriate evasive action by trying to counter steer while braking, resulting in overcompensation and poor directional control. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver had only owned the vehicle for two months and had no prior experience driving an SUV.
