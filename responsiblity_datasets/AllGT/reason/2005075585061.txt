The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not notice V2 (the 1990 Airex recreational vehicle) stopped in their lane. This failure to properly observe the road and react in a timely manner led to the collision with the Dune Buggy and the RV. Additionally, the driver of V1 was preoccupied with personal matters, fatigued, and not wearing their prescription glasses, which may have impaired their ability to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and driver-related factors contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
