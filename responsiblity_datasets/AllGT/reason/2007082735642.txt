The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn onto the northbound roadway. This is evident from the fact that V1 did not notice V2 (the Chrysler New Yorker) heading northbound in the intended travel lane. The driver of V1 claims that a utility pole and the vehicle's A pillar may have contributed to the lack of vision, but ultimately, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed with a turn. Therefore, V1's failure to properly survey the intersection and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision, making them primarily responsible.
