The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at the boats to the right of the highway when traffic slowed down in front of him. This distraction caused him to not notice the slowing traffic in time and subsequently rear-end V2 (the 2002 Lexus ES300). V2, on the other hand, was following the flow of traffic and slowed down behind V3 (the 1992 BMW 525i) as traffic came to a stop. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was attributed to another motor vehicle in the lane traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's external distraction, which caused him to fail to stop in time and collide with the vehicle in front.
