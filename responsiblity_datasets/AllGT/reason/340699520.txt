The reason for this is that the driver was unrestrained by a three-point belt, which means he did not take the necessary precautions to secure himself in the vehicle. This lack of restraint resulted in the driver moving forward relative to the vehicle interior during the severe frontal impact. As a result, he suffered multiple injuries, including chest abrasion, sternum fracture, rib fractures, lung contusions, and lacerations to the pericardium and left atrium. While the airbag deployment provided some protection, the driver's failure to wear a seatbelt significantly contributed to the severity of his injuries. Additionally, the unknown source of the distal bilateral thigh contusions suggests that the driver may have been thrown around within the vehicle due to the lack of restraint. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the unrestrained driver of the Chevrolet Cobalt (V1).
