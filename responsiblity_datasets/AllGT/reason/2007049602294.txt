The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were following too closely to respond to the unexpected action of V2 (the driver of the 1993 Ford Taurus) decelerating. V1 stated that V2 suddenly hit the brakes for no apparent reason, but V1 should have maintained a safe following distance to be able to react in time to any sudden braking by the vehicle in front. Additionally, V1 was not aware of the approaching ambulance and did not anticipate the need to slow down or stop. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the deceleration of V2 is the primary reason for the accident.
