The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it struck Vehicle 2 (V2) in the left side as V2 was making a left turn. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the imprint of V2's LR wheel on the right side of V1's front bumper further supports V1's failure to yield. Furthermore, the fact that V1 rotated counterclockwise and struck V2 again in a sideslap impact suggests that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle after the initial collision, potentially indicating excessive speed or lack of proper maneuvering. Overall, V1's failure to yield and subsequent loss of control contribute to its primary responsibility for the crash.
