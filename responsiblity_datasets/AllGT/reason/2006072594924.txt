The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by another speeding and lane-changing vehicle ahead of him, as well as being under the influence of alcohol and drugs, specifically marijuana. This impaired his focus and judgment while driving. Additionally, the driver panicked when he encountered congestion ahead and made sudden and erratic maneuvers, swerving across all lanes of traffic and ultimately losing control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was coded as driver-related factor: overcompensation. This indicates that the driver's overreaction to the situation led to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction, impairment, and overcompensation while driving.
