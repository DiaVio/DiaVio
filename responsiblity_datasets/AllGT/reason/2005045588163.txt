The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 fell asleep at the wheel, resulting in the vehicle departing the right side of the road and colliding with two concrete bridge pillars. The driver's admission to first responders that he had fallen asleep, along with the witness report of the vehicle gradually drifting off the road, supports the conclusion that the driver's fatigue was the critical reason for the crash.
