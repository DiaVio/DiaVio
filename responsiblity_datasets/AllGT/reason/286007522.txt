The reason for this is that V2 entered the eastbound lane in front of V1, causing V1 to steer right to avoid the crash and subsequently lose control. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision with the utility pole. Additionally, V2 fled the scene, further suggesting their responsibility for the accident.
