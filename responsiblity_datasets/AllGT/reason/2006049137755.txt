The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, and the front of V2 (the 1991 Cadillac Deville) struck the right side of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, causing the collision. Additionally, V1's right side then struck the left side of V2, further indicating that V1 was at fault for the initial impact. Therefore, V1's failure to yield while turning left makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
