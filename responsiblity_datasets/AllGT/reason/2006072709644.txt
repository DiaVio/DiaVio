The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was traveling at a high rate of speed and engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including frequent lane changes and failure to control the vehicle. V1 encroached into V2's travel lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 subsequently crashed into a light pole, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle.
