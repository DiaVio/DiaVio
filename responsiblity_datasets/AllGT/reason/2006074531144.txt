The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the intersection, even though there was supposed to be a stop sign. This was due to the driver's lack of knowledge about the stop sign, as it had been missing for two days. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not look to his right before entering the intersection and did not see V2 until just before impact. These actions demonstrate a failure to exercise caution and follow traffic rules, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
