The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the traffic before entering the roadway. She stated that she looked to the left and did not see any vehicle approaching, but she failed to look back to her left side to ensure that traffic was not present before entering the traffic lane. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision with Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 mentioned that she had woken up three hours earlier than normal due to a shift change, indicating possible driver fatigue as a contributing factor. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he tried to avoid the crash by applying the brakes and steering to the right, but was unable to do so. There were no critical reasons or associated factors coded for Vehicle #2, indicating that the driver was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the traffic before entering the roadway.
