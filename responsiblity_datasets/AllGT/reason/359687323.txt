The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway to the left, traveled up the center median, and then crossed into the opposite side of the road, heading towards the westbound lanes. This action caused a chain reaction, leading to the subsequent collisions with Vehicle 2 (V2) and Vehicle 3 (V3), resulting in damage to all vehicles involved and injuries to the case occupant in V1.
