The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop and collided with the rear of V2. The driver of V1 admitted to being on his way to school and stated that the traffic came to a quick stop in front of him. However, he was cited for the crash for failure to use due care, indicating that he did not exercise the necessary caution and attention required to avoid the collision. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 56 kmph, which suggests that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted speed limit of 40 kmph. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in lane two due to the rush hour congestion ahead. The driver of V2 was not at fault as he was following normal work route and came to a stop when he was hit from behind by V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to stop and exercise due care.
