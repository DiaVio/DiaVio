The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the snowy conditions. The driver tapped the brake when the non-contact vehicle's trailer was passing, causing the loss of control and subsequent collision with the median wall. The driver's false assumption about the road conditions and the presence of loose snow on the roadway also contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver's medication for anxiety and the use of Ibuprofen for pain were not considered factors in the crash.
