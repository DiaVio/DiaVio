The driver of V1 failed to yield before making a left turn at the intersection, which resulted in the collision with V2 (the 2002 Large Public Transportation Bus). The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by the radio and conversation with her passengers, indicating inadequate surveillance. This distraction likely caused her to neglect checking for oncoming traffic before making the left turn. On the other hand, the driver of V2 claimed to have the right of way and was traveling within the speed limit. However, without further information or an interview, it is difficult to determine if there were any contributing factors on the part of the driver of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance while making a left turn.
