The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded through the intersection, disregarding the right of way of V2. The driver's distraction by a cat crossing the roadway and her admission of being upset due to family problems indicate a lack of attention and focus while driving. Additionally, the driver's statement that she looked but did not see anything suggests a failure to properly assess the intersection before proceeding. These factors, combined with the driver's fatigue and infrequent driving, contribute to her responsibility for the accident.
