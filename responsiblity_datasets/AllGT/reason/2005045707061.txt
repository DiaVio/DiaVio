The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while trying to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle that was crowding their lane. This overcompensation led to Vehicle #1 departing the left side of the road and ultimately crashing into the tree line. The driver's internal distraction of adjusting the radio prior to the incident may have contributed to the overcompensation. Additionally, the calculated radius of curvature for the curve (107m) did not meet the AASHTO standard of 128m for a curve with a posted speed of 35 mph. Driver inexperience was also identified as an associated factor.
