The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 attempted to make a left turn across the path of Vehicle #1, which was traveling straight on the arterial road. Vehicle #2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see Vehicle #1 approaching. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision. Additionally, Vehicle #2 mentioned being uncomfortable with the presence of a reduced size spare tire on the right rear of the vehicle. While this may have contributed to her discomfort, it does not excuse the failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the recognition error and inadequate surveillance while attempting a left turn at the intersection.
