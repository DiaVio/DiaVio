The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Volkswagen Jetta, was the one who made the left turn without adequately surveilling the road. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V2 crossed into the path of V1. The critical reason for V2 was coded as inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to see V1 before making the left turn. The driver admitted to not seeing V1 and mentioned being preoccupied with other thoughts and concerns. On the other hand, V1, the driver of the Ford F-150, was found to have made a false assumption of V2's actions. However, V1 had already changed into the oncoming lane in a passing zone to overtake V2, indicating that V1 had taken precautions to pass legally. V1's assumption that V2 would continue straight can be seen as a contributing factor, but the primary responsibility lies with V2 for not properly surveilling the road before making the left turn. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and crossing into the path of V1 while making a left turn.
