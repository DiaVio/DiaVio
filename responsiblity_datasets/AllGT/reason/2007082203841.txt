The driver of V1 was distracted by looking in his side mirrors while attempting to change lanes due to the stop and go traffic. As a result, he failed to notice that the vehicles in front had slowed down and was unable to avoid impacting the rear of V2 (the 1993 Acura Integra). The driver of V1 also reported feeling lightly fatigued, which may have contributed to his inability to react in time.
