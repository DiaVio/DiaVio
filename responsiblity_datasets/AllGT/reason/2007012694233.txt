The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and entered the intersection against a red light. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection" and the critical reason for the event was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe and assess the traffic situation before entering the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1. V1 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer) stated that he entered the intersection when the light was amber and believed he had enough time to make it through. While V1 may have contributed to the crash by not stopping for the red light, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and proceed cautiously when the light turned green is the primary cause of the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash.
