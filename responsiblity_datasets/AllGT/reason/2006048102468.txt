The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal factor, specifically a sneeze. This distraction caused the driver to momentarily take their eyes off the road, resulting in them not noticing that the other vehicles ahead had stopped for the red traffic signal. As a result, V1 collided with the back of V2, which then pushed V2 forward into the back of V3. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper attention and awareness of the road conditions, due to the internal distraction of sneezing, led to the chain reaction collision with V2 and V3.
