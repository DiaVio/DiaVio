The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the right pavement edge and subsequently collided with a mailbox and a large diameter tree. The driver was unrestrained, as confirmed by the absence of loading evidence on the available seat belt system. The lack of restraint use contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the driver. Additionally, the driver's head struck the rear-view mirror and windshield, resulting in fractures and the presence of hair strands and skin tissue. This indicates that the driver was not properly positioned or restrained at the time of the collision. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle 1 for failing to maintain control of the vehicle and not using the available seat belt restraint system.
