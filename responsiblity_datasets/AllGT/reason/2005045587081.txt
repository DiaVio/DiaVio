The driver of Vehicle 1 was traveling too fast for the curve in the road, which led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver was also under the influence of alcohol and prescription medication, which could have contributed to impaired judgment and drowsiness. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the vehicle, as it was a company van that he rarely drove. These factors, combined with the excessive speed, resulted in the driver's inability to negotiate the curve and ultimately caused the crash.
