The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel while entering a curve, which caused the vehicle to drift into lane 2. When the driver woke up, they overcompensated by cranking the steering wheel to the right, resulting in V1 rolling onto its left side and eventually ending up on its roof in the median. Several factors contributed to the causation of the crash, including the driver's fatigue from spending the day at an outdoor music festival in 95-degree heat, driving for 2 hours before the crash, and the time of the crash being 16 plus hours since the driver's last sleep. Additionally, the driver admitted to being fatigued at the start of the trip and consuming alcohol with dinner preceding the trip. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's fatigue, overcompensation, and potential impairment from alcohol consumption.
