The reason for this is that V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while turning left at the intersection. V1 stated that they stopped at the stop sign and pulled forward to see traffic, but they failed to accurately assess the distance and speed of V2. This misjudgment led to V1 turning left when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 had consumed alcohol before the trip and had a BAC of 0.11, which is above the legal limit in many jurisdictions. This impaired the driver's judgment and reaction time, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2005 International flatbed tow truck) was not coded with any critical reason for the pre-crash event. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 does not appear to bear primary responsibility for the collision.
