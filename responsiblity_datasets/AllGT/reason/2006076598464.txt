The reason for this is that V1 crossed the centerline and then veered back to the right before departing the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it leaving the road and ultimately crashing into two trees. Additionally, the investigating officer listed the driver's speed at 24 kmph (15 mph) above the posted speed limit, suggesting that excessive speed may have been a contributing factor. Furthermore, the statement from the second witness, who observed the driver of V1 looking "scared or surprised," suggests that the driver may have been distracted or not fully focused on the road, which could have contributed to the loss of control. Overall, the combination of crossing the centerline, veering off the road, and potential distraction or lack of focus on the part of the driver indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
