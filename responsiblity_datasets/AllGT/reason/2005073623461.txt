The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The witness stated that the V1 driver looked left and then right, but failed to look left a second time before crossing the intersection. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2 (the 1999 Ford E150 van) that was occupying the left turn lane.
