The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to completely stop behind V2 (the Jeep Cherokee) and collided with the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and did not maintain a safe distance, resulting in the rear-end collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted that her foot slipped off the brake pedal as she was approaching the intersection. This indicates a performance error and poor directional control on the part of V1. Although V2 was stopped in lane two, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle in lane traveling in the same direction with a higher speed." However, the critical reason was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to following too closely, failing to stop, and a performance error in controlling the vehicle.
