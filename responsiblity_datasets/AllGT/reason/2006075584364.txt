The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at a motel sign to her left and did not observe the presence of V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) while making her left turn. This distraction caused her to proceed with the turn without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2.
