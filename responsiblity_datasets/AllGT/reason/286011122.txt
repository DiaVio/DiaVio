The reason for this is that V1 lost control after passing through the intersection and entered the median with counter clockwise rotation. V1 then impacted a tree with its right side, causing the vehicle to roll two quarter turns before coming to a final rest on its roof in the median. The fact that V1 lost control and ultimately crashed into a tree suggests that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unbelted, which likely contributed to the severity of his injuries.
