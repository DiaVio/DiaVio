The reason for this is that V2 changed lanes into the number five lane without properly observing the traffic ahead. The driver admitted to looking in his left side mirror as he made the lane change, indicating a failure to look far enough forward to notice V1 decelerating due to the congested rush hour traffic. This driver-related factor of external distraction contributed to the critical pre-crash event for V2, resulting in the collision with V1.
