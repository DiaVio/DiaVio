The reason for V1's responsibility is that it initiated a u-turn from the right shoulder across the highway, intending to travel eastbound. This action violated the right-of-way of V2 (the 1997 Ford Explorer) which was traveling eastbound in lane one. As a result, V2 collided with the right side of V1. V1's driver was distracted by the prisoner in the rear seat, which was identified as an internal distraction. This distraction likely contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and make a safe u-turn maneuver. Therefore, V1's actions and the driver's distraction are the primary factors that led to the accident.
