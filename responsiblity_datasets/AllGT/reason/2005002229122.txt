The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 indicated that he became dizzy while driving due to a new blood pressure medication that he had just started taking that morning. This impaired his ability to act and resulted in him driving off the road, overcorrecting, and ultimately crashing into a tree. The driver's physical impairment and non-performance error are the critical reasons for the crash.
