The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal factor, specifically reaching for his cell phone charger that had fallen off the seat. This distraction caused him to take his eyes off the road while negotiating a curve, resulting in V1 leaving the roadway and colliding with a gas meter and utility pole. Additionally, the driver admitted to thinking about personal problems, which may have further contributed to his lack of focus on the road.
