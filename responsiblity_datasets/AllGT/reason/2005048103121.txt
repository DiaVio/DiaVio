The driver of V1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver by attempting to pass through the intersection while the light was red or changing from red to green. Additionally, aggressive driving was coded as an associative factor for this driver. These actions indicate a disregard for traffic laws and safety, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier) was not primarily responsible for the accident. The critical precrash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from crossing the street across the path. This suggests that V2 entered the intersection in accordance with traffic laws and was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their illegal maneuver and aggressive driving, while V2 was not at fault.
