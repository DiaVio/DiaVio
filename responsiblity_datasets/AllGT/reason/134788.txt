The reason for this is that V2 experienced a tire blowout, causing it to veer to the left and make contact with the right side of V1. V2 continued to jackknife and crossed the median, ultimately rolling onto its right side. This sequence of events indicates that the blowout and subsequent loss of control by V2 initiated the accident.
