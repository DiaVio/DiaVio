The reason for V1's responsibility is that they crossed over the left lane line in an attempt to turn left, which resulted in the front of their vehicle impacting the left side of V2 (the Mazda MPV). This action by V1 caused the collision and subsequent rollover of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming at the time of the crash. This driver-related factor of inattention further supports V1's responsibility for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their improper lane usage and inattentive driving behavior.
