The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive and distracted by talking on his cell phone, which led to him not noticing the slowed or stopped traffic ahead. This resulted in him approaching the traffic too fast and having to steer left suddenly to avoid a collision. This sudden maneuver caused him to lose control of his vehicle and cross into the oncoming lanes, ultimately leading to the collision with V2 (the Kenworth Dump Truck). Additionally, V1's overcompensation and poor directional control were considered associative factors in the accident. These factors further indicate that V1's actions and lack of attention were the main contributing factors to the crash. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. However, a critical reason was not assigned to V2, suggesting that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inattention, distraction, and poor control of the vehicle, while V2's actions were not a significant contributing factor.
