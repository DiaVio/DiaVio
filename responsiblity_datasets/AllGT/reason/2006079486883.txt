The driver of V1 was distracted by reaching for his cell phone, which caused him to veer off the roadway and impact the cinder block wall. The evidence supports this conclusion, as there were no pre-impact tire marks and the damage to the tire appeared to be from the impact with the wall. Additionally, the driver's cell phone was found outside the vehicle after the crash, indicating that he was reaching for it at the time of the collision.
