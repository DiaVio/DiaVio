The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to taking his eyes off the road and reaching down near the right front seat to get a radio, causing him to collide with the back of V2 (the 1994 Chevrolet S-10 pickup). The driver of V1 did not attempt to avoid the collision and did not brake or make any avoidance efforts. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead are the primary factors that led to the crash.
