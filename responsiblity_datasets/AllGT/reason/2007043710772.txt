The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to see V2 (the Pontiac Vibe) in front of them. V1 admitted to looking down inside her vehicle for an unknown object, which caused her to not notice V2 in her travel lane. This distraction led to V1 colliding into the rear of V2 without making any avoidance maneuvers. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and their internal distraction are the main factors contributing to their primary responsibility for the accident.
