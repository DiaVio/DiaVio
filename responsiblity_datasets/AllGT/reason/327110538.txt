The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle on the snowy/slushy road conditions. The vehicle drifted right, departed the road, and sideswiped a guard rail, indicating a loss of control. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. It is important to note that the road and weather conditions may have played a role in the accident, but ultimately, the responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for not adapting to the conditions and losing control of the vehicle.
