The reason for this is that the driver of V1 drifted to the right and struck the curb with the right front tire. This indicates a driver-related error, as the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, it is mentioned that the steering wheel had a lot of play and was not as responsive as it should have been, indicating a vehicle-related steering deficiency. Therefore, the combination of the driver's error in drifting off the road and the steering deficiency in the vehicle contributed to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
