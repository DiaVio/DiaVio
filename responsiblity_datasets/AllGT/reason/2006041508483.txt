The driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including following too closely and making rapid and frequent lane changes to pass slower-moving traffic. The driver's decision to change lanes without ensuring a safe gap and failing to adjust their speed to match the rest of the traffic stream on wet roads contributed to the loss of control of their vehicle. This resulted in a collision with V2 and subsequently with V3.
