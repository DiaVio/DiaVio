The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep prior to the crash and has a history of falling asleep while driving. This indicates that the driver was not alert and in control of the vehicle at the time of the accident. Additionally, the driver had only one hour of sleep in the 24-hour period preceding the crash, which further supports the conclusion that driver fatigue was a contributing factor. The driver's medical conditions, including narcolepsy and sleep apnea, also suggest a higher risk of falling asleep while driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's negligence in operating the vehicle while being aware of their tendency to fall asleep.
