The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection and misjudged the gap and speed of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Ford Mustang). V1 had a false assumption that V2 would yield to her vehicle. This false assumption led to V1 turning left in front of V2, resulting in the collision.
