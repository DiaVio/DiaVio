The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included heavy rain, immersed roadway, and heavy traffic. Additionally, V1 lost control of the vehicle after another vehicle splashed standing water onto their windshield, obscuring their vision. This led to V1 veering to the right and sideswiping V2. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust their speed to the conditions and their inability to maintain control of their vehicle after the water splashing incident contributed to the crash.
