The reason for this is that V1 was turning left into the shopping plaza and failed to yield to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the 2003 Honda Odyssey Minivan) traveling southbound in lane one. V2 had the right of way as it was proceeding straight through the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that V1 turned without yielding, indicating that V1 was trying to beat oncoming traffic. This further supports the conclusion that V1 failed to properly yield and caused the collision.
