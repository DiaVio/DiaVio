The reason for this is that the evidence at the scene does not support the driver's claim of swerving to avoid deer. Instead, it indicates a gradual run off the road with no evidence of attempted braking. Additionally, factors such as impairment by alcohol, open intoxicant in the vehicle, driver fatigue, and unfamiliarity with the roadway contribute to the driver's poor directional control, leading to the accident.
