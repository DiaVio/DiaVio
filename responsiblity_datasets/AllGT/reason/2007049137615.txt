The reason for this is that V1 was backing out from a parking stall and failed to adequately surveil the roadway before entering. V1's driver stated that he did not detect V2 until impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1's driver, leading to the collision.
