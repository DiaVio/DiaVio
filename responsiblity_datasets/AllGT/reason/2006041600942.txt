The driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by looking at a previous crash that had just occurred before the accident. This distraction caused him to abruptly stop behind V3, which subsequently led to V1 being unable to stop in time and colliding with the rear of V2. Therefore, V2's distraction and sudden stop were the main factors that caused the chain reaction collision, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
