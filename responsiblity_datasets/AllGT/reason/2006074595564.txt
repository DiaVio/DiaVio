The reason for this is that V2 was negotiating a curve on the eastbound lanes, and V1 (the driver of the 2001 Ford Escort) was traveling straight on the northbound lane. V2 failed to look to either side ahead, which resulted in V2 encroaching into the path of V1. This failure to yield the right of way and failure to look for oncoming traffic led to the collision between the front of V1 and the right side of V2. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and failure to look for oncoming traffic while negotiating the curve.
