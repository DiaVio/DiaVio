The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 17-year old female, admitted to being confused by the signage in the downtown area and mistakenly thought her light was green. She proceeded through the intersection without stopping, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two (V2). Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V1's speed at impact to be 64 kmph (40 mph), which is higher than the posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to stop at the intersection, combined with the higher estimated speed, indicate a clear disregard for traffic rules and safety precautions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
