The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the driver of the vehicle in lane 1 and was not able to stop in time to avoid colliding with V2 (the 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera). The police report states that V1's driver was tracking the driver in lane 1 and did not return his attention to V2 or the traffic ahead in time to stop. This distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them led to the collision.
