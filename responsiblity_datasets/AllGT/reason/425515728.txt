The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was stopped at a parking lot exit and proceeded to turn left across the lane of travel of Vehicle 1 (the 2007 Pontiac G5 compact coupe). This action violated the right of way of Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision between the front plane of Vehicle 1 and the left plane of Vehicle 2.
