The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of multiple medications (xanax, paxil, depakote, and amitriptyline) and was also driving with a cast on her left foot. These factors impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, the driver admitted to attempting to drive a manual transmission vehicle with her left foot in a cast, which further indicates a lack of proper control and attention while driving. Furthermore, the narrow and winding nature of the road without any shoulders can be considered as an associated factor, but the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to her impaired condition and actions.
