The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the right eastbound through lane and intended to cross through the intersection. However, it collided with Vehicle 2 (the 2012 Honda CRV compact utility vehicle) which was in the right northbound left turn lane and intended to turn left at the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
