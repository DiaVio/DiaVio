The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to stop in time and impacted the rear of V2 (the Mazda). This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, V1's statement to the police on scene that they tried to swerve and hit the brakes but were unsuccessful suggests a lack of attentiveness and failure to exercise due care while driving. Therefore, V1's failure to stop in time and their inability to avoid the collision make them primarily responsible for the crash.
