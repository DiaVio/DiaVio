The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was inattentive and not focused on the driving task. The driver admitted to being in thought about an upcoming intersection where she needed to turn, and as a result, she failed to notice that the traffic light was red. This lack of attention and failure to stop led to V1 crossing the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the witness statement supports V1's responsibility as the witness observed V1 not slowing down for the red light and entering the intersection, leading to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's inattentiveness and failure to stop at the red light make them primarily responsible for the crash.
