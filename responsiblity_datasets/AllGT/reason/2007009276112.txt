The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Despite seeing a police vehicle pass through the intersection, the driver did not ensure that there were no more emergency vehicles approaching. This lack of surveillance led to V1 entering the intersection without yielding to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was using prescription medication to treat hypertension, which could have potentially affected her ability to react and make appropriate decisions while driving.
