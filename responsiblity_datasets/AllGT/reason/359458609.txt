The reason for this is that V1 lost control and departed the roadway after hydroplaning on standing water. V1 then collided with the mountain rock wall, resulting in severe injuries to the front right passenger who was wearing a seatbelt and in a reclined position. The driver of V1 also sustained minor injuries.
