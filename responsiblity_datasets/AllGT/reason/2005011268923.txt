The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before pulling out of the driveway. She stated that she may not have even glanced to her left before proceeding, which indicates a lack of proper observation. This driver error of inadequate surveillance led to V1 pulling out across the path of V2 (the driver of the 1997 Ford E-150 cargo work van), causing the collision.
