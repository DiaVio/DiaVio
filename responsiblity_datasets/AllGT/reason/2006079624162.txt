The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related decision error by misjudging the gap or the speed of V2 (the 1985 Toyota Celica). V1 stated that she saw V2 approaching but believed she had enough time to execute the left turn. However, V2 was closer than V1 perceived, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's distraction at the time of the crash, thinking about her poetry meeting, may have contributed to her misjudgment of the situation. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and distraction make her primarily responsible for the collision.
