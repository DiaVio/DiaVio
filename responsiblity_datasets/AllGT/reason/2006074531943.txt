The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle two, which was traveling straight in the opposite direction. The driver of Vehicle one was found to be at fault due to inattention and distraction caused by being engaged in a conversation on her cell phone. This distraction led to her not paying attention to the driving task and ultimately resulted in the collision with Vehicle two.
