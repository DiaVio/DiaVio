The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver ran a red light, which is considered an illegal maneuver. The driver of V1 stated that he had difficulty differentiating the right turn arrow from the solid green light due to the LED style of traffic controls. However, it was observed that the right turn arrow was only present concurrently with the solid red signal. Therefore, the driver of V1 mistakenly believed the light was solid green and proceeded through the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the 2000 Jeep Cherokee) had a solid green light and was traveling within the speed limit. The driver of V2 stated that V1 did not slow down or show any signs of stopping, and he applied his brakes but was unable to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light, while V2 was following traffic rules and had the right of way.
