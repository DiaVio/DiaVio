The driver of V1 rear-ended V2, the Hyundai Accent, which then caused V2 to collide with V3, the Ford F150. The police report states that the driver of V1 was traveling westbound when V2 suddenly stopped. The driver of V1 admitted to trying to stop but was unable to do so, resulting in the collision. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of the vehicle in front of them. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and misjudgment of the gap or speed of the vehicle in front of them.
