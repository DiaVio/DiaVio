The reason for this is that V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, meaning that the driver failed to properly observe and assess the intersection before proceeding. This is supported by the driver's statement that they didn't see anyone approaching the intersection and their admission that there is a sight restriction caused by raised yard and shrubbery to the right. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, which may have impaired their ability to properly observe the intersection.
