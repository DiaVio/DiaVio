The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle in poor road conditions, specifically due to hydroplaning on the wet roadway. Additionally, the driver's decision to tap the brakes and steer out of the skid was ineffective in preventing the crash. The low tread on all four tires of V1 may have also contributed to the loss of control.
