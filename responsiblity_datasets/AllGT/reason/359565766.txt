The reason for this is that V2 departed the roadway to the right, leaving track marks on the dirt and gravel area. It then returned to the roadway and began to rotate counterclockwise, crossing into the eastbound lane and into the path of V1. The impact occurred when the front of V1 collided with the right side of V2. V2's actions of leaving the roadway, crossing into the opposite lane, and causing the collision indicate that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
