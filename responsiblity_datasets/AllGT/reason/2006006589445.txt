The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1, on the other hand, was traveling straight through the intersection with the right of way. V2's false assumption of V1's actions, assuming that V1 would stop or yield, led to the collision. Additionally, V2's unwillingness to participate in the study and provide further details about the crash suggests a lack of cooperation and responsibility.
