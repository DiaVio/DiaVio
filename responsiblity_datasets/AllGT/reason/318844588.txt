The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling east on a two-lane two-way shopping center connector road and was approaching a four-way intersection intending to continue straight. Both vehicles proceeded into the intersection, and the front of Vehicle 1 struck the right plane of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
