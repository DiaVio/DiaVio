The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it went off the roadway to the right, traveled down a ditch, and ultimately struck a tree with its front right. This indicates that V1 deviated from its intended path and failed to maintain control while negotiating the curve. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not wearing the available seatbelt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. Overall, V1's actions of leaving the roadway, failing to maintain control, and the driver's failure to wear a seatbelt make it primarily responsible for the accident.
