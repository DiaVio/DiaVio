The driver of V1 made an improper lane change into lane four, hitting the right side of V2. This action caused V2 to rotate across four lanes of traffic and come to a rest facing southbound. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. The driver of V1 was also found to be driving under the influence, with an expired license, and was an illegal immigrant. These factors further contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
