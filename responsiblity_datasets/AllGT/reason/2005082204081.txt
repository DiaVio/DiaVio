The driver of V1 initiated a lane change without ensuring that the lane was clear, resulting in a sudden maneuver to avoid another vehicle. This overcompensation led to V1 departing the road and colliding with the concrete jersey barrier on the left side, and subsequently with the barrier on the right side. The driver's inexperience, with only 12 months of driving experience and 6 months in the specific vehicle, may have contributed to the driver's inability to properly assess the situation and execute a safe lane change. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's overcompensation and lack of experience.
