The driver of V-1 admitted to not paying attention and falsely assuming that the traffic light had turned green. This false assumption led to him not realizing that V-2 (the 1993 Nissan Sentra) was stopped in the #1 lane. As a result, V-1 failed to stop in time and struck the rear of V-2. Therefore, V-1's lack of attention and false assumption of the other vehicle's actions make him primarily responsible for the accident.
