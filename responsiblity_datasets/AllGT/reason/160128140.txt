The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway and struck a tree and a telephone pole. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
