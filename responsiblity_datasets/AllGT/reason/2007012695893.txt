The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding to make a left turn. The driver of V1 did not see V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Trans Sport) approaching from the northbound lane and proceeded into the intersection without yielding the right-of-way. Additionally, an associated factor contributing to the accident was the sightline restriction caused by shrubbery on the southeast corner of the intersection, which may have further hindered the driver of V1's ability to see oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
