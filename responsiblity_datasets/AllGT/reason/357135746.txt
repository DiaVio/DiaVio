The reason for this is that V2 drifted off the east edge of the roadway, indicating that the driver of V2 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V2 over-corrected, causing the vehicle to enter a counterclockwise yaw and cross the centerline, ultimately resulting in the collision with the front-left corner of the case vehicle. Therefore, V2's actions of drifting off the road and over-correcting led to the accident, making it primarily responsible.
