The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 impacted the right rear of Vehicle #3, causing it to skid and rotate across all lanes of travel. This initial impact set off a chain reaction, leading to the subsequent collision between Vehicle #3 and Vehicle #2. Since Vehicle #1 left the scene without stopping, it can be inferred that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and did not take appropriate actions to avoid the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
