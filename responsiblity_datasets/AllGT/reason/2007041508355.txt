The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and took her eyes off the roadway to look at an unknown object inside the vehicle. This distraction caused her to fail to notice that traffic had suddenly slowed down in the intersection, resulting in her striking the rear of V2 (the GMC Sierra). Additionally, V1 made a false assumption that the truck in front of her would continue to proceed through the intersection, which further contributed to the accident.
