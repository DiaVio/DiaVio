The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was momentarily distracted and failed to notice that traffic ahead was stopped. This distraction led to V1 attempting to avoid the vehicles by steering right, resulting in the left side of V1 impacting the back of V2. This chain of events caused the subsequent impact between V2 and V3.
