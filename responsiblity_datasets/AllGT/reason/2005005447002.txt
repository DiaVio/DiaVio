Reason: V1 ran a steady red light, indicating a clear violation of traffic laws. This action caused the collision with V2, which had the right of way with a green traffic signal. The driver of V1 admitted to a recognition error and inadequate surveillance, indicating a failure to properly observe and react to the traffic signal. Additionally, the driver's medical condition of muscular dystrophy, although claimed to not hinder her ability to drive, may have contributed to the recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
