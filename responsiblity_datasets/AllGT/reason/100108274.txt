The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver steered the vehicle hard to the right for an unknown reason, causing the vehicle to lose control and roll over. Eyewitness accounts indicate that there were no other vehicles or outside stimuli that prompted this maneuver. Therefore, the driver's actions are the main contributing factor to the accident.
