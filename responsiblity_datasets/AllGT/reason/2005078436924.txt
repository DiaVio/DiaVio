The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. In this case, V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) had noticed an emergency vehicle coming from the opposite direction and stopped in the traffic lane. However, V1 was unable to stop in time and ended up rear-ending V2. V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to stop in time indicates that she was not driving at a speed appropriate for the conditions and was not able to react to the actions of other drivers on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
