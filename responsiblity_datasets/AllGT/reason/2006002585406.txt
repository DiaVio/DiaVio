The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by watching a paint truck in the opposite lane, which caused her to not pay attention to the vehicle in front of her. This distraction led to her being too close to V2 (the Honda CR-V) and ultimately rear-ending it. The driver of V1 also mentioned that she was traveling at a high speed, between 82-97 KMPH (51-60 MPH), which could have contributed to the severity of the collision.
