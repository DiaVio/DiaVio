The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The police reported travel speed of 64 kmph (40 mph) indicates that V1 was exceeding the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph) for the road. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event coded for V1 was "This vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." This indicates that the driver's excessive speed on the icy road caused them to lose control of the vehicle, leading to the rollover crash. While there were other factors associated with the driver of V1, such as the use of prescription medications and the weather conditions, the primary reason for the crash was the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the slick road conditions.
