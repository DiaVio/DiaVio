The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is a violation of traffic laws. V1's false assumption of V2's actions, specifically not realizing that V2 was going to stop again, contributed to the collision. V1 had the obligation to yield the right of way to V2, who was already stopped at the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and their false assumption of V2's actions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
