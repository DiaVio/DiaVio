The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn and entered the path of the case vehicle (V1), the 2006 Honda Civic. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the front of V1 striking the right side of V2. This indicates that V2 violated the right of way of V1, causing the collision.
