The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 48-year-old female, drifted over the right lane line into the parking lane, resulting in a collision with V2, a legally parked vehicle. V1 then continued forward and struck V2 again before finally colliding with V3, another legally parked vehicle. The driver of V1 had a history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and had just been discharged from the hospital for observations related to throat and chest pains. Despite experiencing severe pain and being aware of her suspended license, the driver made the decision to operate the vehicle to take herself to a different hospital. The critical pre-crash event was coded as V1 traveling over the lane line on the right side, and the critical reason was identified as a driver-related factor, specifically a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. The driver's physical condition, emotional distress, fatigue, and the possible side effects of her medications all contributed to impairing her ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired physical condition and decision to operate the vehicle despite knowing the risks involved.
