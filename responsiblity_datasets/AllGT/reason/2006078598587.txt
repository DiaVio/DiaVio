The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an illegal maneuver by entering the intersection after the light had turned red. Despite the driver's assumption that the other vehicle would yield to him, it is the responsibility of the driver to obey traffic signals and not proceed through a red light. This illegal maneuver resulted in the collision with V2, who had the right of way to complete their left turn.
