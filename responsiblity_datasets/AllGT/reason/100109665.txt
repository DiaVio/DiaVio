The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 allowed the vehicle to veer to the right for an unknown reason, causing it to leave the roadway and trip to the left. This resulted in the vehicle overturning multiple times and colliding with a meter light pole and a large tree. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated travel lanes led to the accident.
