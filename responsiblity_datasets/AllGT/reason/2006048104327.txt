The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 departed the roadway to the right and struck a fire hydrant, a light pole, and a cement curb. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain proper control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the crash. The driver of V1 also admitted that he steered right to avoid an impact with a non-contact vehicle, suggesting that his actions contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the driver-related factor of poor directional control and the possibility of the driver panicking further support V1's primary responsibility for the accident. The wet roadway conditions may have also played a role, but ultimately it was V1's actions and lack of control that led to the crash.
