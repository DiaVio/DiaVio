The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver was unrestrained by a three-point belt, which means he was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. This lack of restraint likely contributed to the driver's movement forward and outboard during the impact with the tree, leading to the injuries sustained. Additionally, the driver's injuries, such as the contusion to the left clavicle, left hemothorax, lacerations to the pericardium, inferior vena cava, and liver, can be attributed to contact with the steering wheel assembly via the deployed airbag. These injuries suggest that the driver was in close proximity to the steering wheel, which could have been avoided or mitigated with the use of a seatbelt. Therefore, the lack of seatbelt usage by the driver of V1 makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
