The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve in the road. This loss of control caused V1 to veer to the left, cross lanes and shoulders, and ultimately collide with the median barrier. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle indicates negligence on their part, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
