The reason for this is that V1 was driving aggressively and erratically, changing lanes without proper observation and not paying attention to the traffic in front of her. Additionally, V1 was reported to be driving at a high rate of speed, exceeding the speed limit, and had been involved in minor collisions with other vehicles prior to the rear-end collision with V2. These factors indicate a lack of caution and control on the part of V1, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
