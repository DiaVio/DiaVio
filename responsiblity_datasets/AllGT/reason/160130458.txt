The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn from the eastbound lane, crossing the path of Vehicle Two (V2), the 2004 Lincoln Navigator SUV, which was traveling in the westbound lane. The contact between the right side of V1 and the front of V2 indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 while making the left turn.
