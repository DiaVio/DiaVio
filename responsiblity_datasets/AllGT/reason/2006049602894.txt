The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes without a clear reason or explanation. The driver of V1 made conflicting statements about avoiding a crash with a semi-truck that had slowed down to a complete stop in his lane, but there is no evidence or testimony from other witnesses to support this claim. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event was coded as "unknown reason for critical event" for V1, indicating a lack of justification for the lane change. On the other hand, V2 (the 1998 Dodge Ram Pick up) was traveling in the second lane and did not exhibit any driver-related factors that contributed to the crash. The driver of V2 did not mention any involvement of a truck or slowing traffic, and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the unsafe lane change attempt.
