The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted a left turn without adequate surveillance. The driver's view of V2 (the 1987 Peugeot) was obstructed by the intervening vehicles in the trafficway, and they stated that they never saw V2 prior to the crash. This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the traffic conditions before making the left turn, resulting in the collision.
