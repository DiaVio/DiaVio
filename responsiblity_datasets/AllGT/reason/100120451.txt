The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to drift off the roadway onto the gravel shoulder, which initiated the chain of events leading to the accident. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and steer it back onto the roadway ultimately resulted in the vehicle overturning and sustaining significant damage.
