The driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with the occupants and looking back over his left shoulder to change lanes. This distraction caused him to inadvertently drive into the gore area and fail to detect the parked vehicle in front of him in time to avoid the crash. Inadequate surveillance and poor directional control were also contributing factors.
