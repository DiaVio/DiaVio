The reason for this is that Vehicle # 1 impacted the rear of Vehicle # 2, indicating that Vehicle # 1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the vehicle in front. Additionally, the associated factors coded to the driver of Vehicle # 1, such as inadequate surveillance and failure to look far enough ahead, suggest that the driver of Vehicle # 1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to anticipate the need to slow down or stop. While Vehicle # 2 was also involved in the crash, the critical reason for the critical event was not coded to the driver of Vehicle # 2. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle # 1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
