The reason for this is that the case occupant was the driver of V1 and was involved in a frontal crash with a large bale of hay. The occupant's vehicle moved forward in relation to the vehicle, indicating that V1 was the striking vehicle. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the case occupant, such as the sternal fracture, rib fractures, vertebral body fracture, and supraspinous ligament injury, suggest that the occupant experienced significant forces due to the impact. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 (the 2015 Honda Fit) and its driver are primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
