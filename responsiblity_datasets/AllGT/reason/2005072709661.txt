The driver of V1 was inexperienced, unfamiliar with the road, and uncomfortable with the surrounding traffic densities. He was also distracted by looking at a map and listening to the satellite radio system in his vehicle. These factors contributed to his inattentiveness and failure to recognize that the traffic ahead had stopped. He misjudged the speed and gap distance of the forward vehicle (V2) and made a false assumption that the traffic would continue to proceed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
