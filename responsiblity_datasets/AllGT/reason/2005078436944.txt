The driver of V1 stated that V2 (the 1997 Dodge pickup) stopped suddenly, and he applied his brakes but skidded for about 9 meters (30 feet) before colliding with the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain a safe following distance and failed to react in a timely manner to the sudden stop of V2. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event in V1 was coded as a driver-related factor: misjudgment of gap or other's speed. This further supports the conclusion that V1's actions or lack thereof contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and misjudgment of the speed and actions of V2.
