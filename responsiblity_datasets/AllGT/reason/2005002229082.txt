The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The driver stated that she proceeded to make the turn because another motorist waved her through, but she did not see Vehicle #2 approaching. This indicates an inadequate surveillance and recognition error on the part of Vehicle #1's driver. Additionally, the driver's concern about returning home quickly and the use of prescription medications, which may have caused side effects such as drowsiness and fatigue, could have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and recognition error. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (Subaru Legacy) was not found to have any critical reason or associated factors contributing to the crash. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he was unable to avoid the collision despite braking and steering right, as Vehicle #1 turned in front of him without enough window of opportunity. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and recognition error, while Vehicle #2 is not found to have contributed to the crash.
