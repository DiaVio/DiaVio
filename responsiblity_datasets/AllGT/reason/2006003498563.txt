The reason for this is that V2 was traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of V1 (the Toyota Camry) suddenly stopping. The driver of V2 stated that they attempted to brake but could not stop in time, indicating that they were unable to maintain a safe following distance. This suggests that V2 was not driving at a speed appropriate for the conditions, which is a driver-related factor contributing to the accident.
