The driver of V1 claimed to have come to a complete stop in the left-turn lane before proceeding, but failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver's inadequate surveillance, coupled with the hillcrest that restricted their view of approaching traffic, led to the collision with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 1991 Mercedes 300E) was encroaching over the left lane line, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as they failed to properly observe the oncoming vehicle and yield the right of way.
