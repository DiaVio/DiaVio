The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced low blood sugar, which caused him to drift off the right side of the roadway and strike the utility pole. The driver admitted to feeling the symptoms of low blood sugar but continued driving without taking appropriate action. This impaired his ability to act and maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the crash. Additionally, the driver stated that he had not eaten for approximately 7-8 hours prior to the crash, which likely contributed to his low blood sugar levels. It is the driver's responsibility to ensure that they are in a suitable physical condition to operate a vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired ability to act caused by low blood sugar and failure to address the symptoms appropriately.
