The reason for this is that the driver of V2 allowed the vehicle to travel off the right roadside during the negotiation of the left curve. The driver's steering maneuver to regain the roadway resulted in V2 entering a counterclockwise yaw and continuing into the oncoming lane, directly into the path of V1 (2007 Toyota Corolla). The driver of V1 observed V2 already in a noticeable yaw but was unable to react before the impact occurred. Therefore, the driver of V2's actions of leaving the roadway and causing the counterclockwise yaw ultimately led to the head-on collision with V1.
