The reason for V1's responsibility is that they made a false assumption that the traffic in other lanes would yield to them, based on being waived on by a vehicle stopped in lane one. This false assumption led V1 to proceed with the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. Additionally, V1 mentioned that the heavy rain and the traffic in lane one obstructed their view of lane two, further contributing to their failure to see V2 approaching. V2, on the other hand, was driving down the roadway and was unable to avoid the collision when V1 pulled across their lane. V2 attempted to steer left and brake, but the presence of oncoming traffic in the turning lane prevented them from stopping in time. Therefore, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's failure to yield the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their false assumption and failure to ensure it was safe to make the left turn.
