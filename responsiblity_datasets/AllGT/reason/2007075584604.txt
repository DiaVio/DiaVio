The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Toyota) which was going straight through the intersection. V1 entered the intersection on a green light, but failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and turned in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's inattention due to thinking about school, limited driving experience, and failure to look far enough ahead were contributing factors to the accident. V2, on the other hand, was driving within their lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, but V1's failure to do so led to the collision. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
