The reason for this is that V1 experienced a vehicle control loss due to a disabling vehicle failure, specifically the right rear tire coming loose and wobbling. This caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver had recently purchased new rims and tires, against the advice of the mechanic who performed the brake work. The driver also did not have the lug nuts re-tightened as recommended. These factors contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
