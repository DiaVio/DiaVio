The reason for this is that V1 impacted the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane-other vehicle stopped," suggesting that V1 failed to react appropriately to the presence of V2 in front of them. However, it is important to note that without further information on the driver actions and the events leading up to the collision, a more detailed analysis of responsibility cannot be determined.
