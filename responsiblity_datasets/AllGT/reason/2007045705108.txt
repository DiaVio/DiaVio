The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed the centerline and struck V2 (the Honda Accord) while traveling west on the secondary arterial. The driver of V1 was distracted by turning to his left to look at his daughter and engage in conversation, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and veer into the opposite lane of traffic. Additionally, V1 was attributed with poor directional control and failing to look far enough ahead, indicating a lack of attentiveness and awareness while driving. On the other hand, V2's driver attempted to steer right in an attempt to avoid the collision, suggesting that he took evasive action to prevent the crash. Therefore, based on the actions and behaviors of the drivers involved, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
