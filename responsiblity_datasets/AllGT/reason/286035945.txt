The reason for this is that V2 lost control on an icy patch in the westbound lane and crossed over into the eastbound lane, resulting in the collision with V1. This indicates that V2 was not able to maintain control of their vehicle and failed to adjust their driving behavior to the road conditions, ultimately causing the accident.
