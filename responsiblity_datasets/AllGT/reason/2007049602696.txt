The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver exhibited aggressive behavior by accelerating rapidly from a stop and turning left at a high rate of speed. The witness at the scene observed that V1 had enough space and time to make a proper turn, but instead, the driver revved the engine and turned left with rapid acceleration. This aggressive driving behavior led to V1 losing control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
