The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to change lanes without adequately surveilling the side, which is a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. This is supported by the fact that V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. Additionally, the driver's inattention, as he was talking to his wife during the lane change, further contributed to the crash. The driver's age of 91, which may have resulted in degraded driving skills, is also believed to have played a role in the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Freight Liner 18-wheel semi) was not found to have contributed to the crash. The driver of V2 stated that V1 changed lanes into his lane, and he tried to apply the brakes to avoid the collision but was unable to stop in time. However, there were no critical reasons or associative factors related to V2's driving behavior. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance, inattention, and potentially degraded driving skills.
