The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a vehicle in lane two and mistakenly believed that it was going to move to the right. As a result, she steered to the right and traveled off the road, ultimately colliding with a signpost and rolling over. The critical reason for the accident was determined to be poor directional control, indicating that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the associated factor of speed suggests that the speed of V1 may have contributed to the accident. Although the exact speed of V1 was not reported, it is likely that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the conditions, given the advisory speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) for the roadway. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's poor directional control and potential excessive speed.
