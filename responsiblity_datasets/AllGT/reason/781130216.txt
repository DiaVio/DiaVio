The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it entered the intersection and proceeded to make a right turn without yielding to the oncoming traffic. V2, the Honda Accord, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. The impact occurred when V1 crossed the path of V2, resulting in the collision and subsequent rotation of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
