The driver of V1 failed to slow down and collided with the rear of V2, which had slowed down dramatically in front of V1. The driver of V1 stated that a phantom red truck from lane five cut across their lanes, causing the traffic to slow down. However, there was no evidence or witness testimony to support the existence of this red truck. The driver of V2 also observed the driver of V1 on his cell phone, indicating a possible distraction. Additionally, following too closely was coded as an associated factor for V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to use due care, internal distraction (cell phone use), and following too closely.
