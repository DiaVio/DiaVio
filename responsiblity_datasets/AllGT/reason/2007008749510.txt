The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to come to a complete stop before reentering the roadway after making a U-turn. This failure to stop and properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 crossing the path of V2 (the 2005 Chevrolet W3500), leading to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking on his cell phone, which contributed to his failure to look to the left and notice V2 approaching. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and their distracted driving are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the accident.
