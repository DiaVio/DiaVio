The reason for this is that V1 experienced a blowout in the left front tire while negotiating a right curve on the interstate. Instead of responding appropriately by steering into the direction of the pull (to the left), V1 overcompensated and steered hard right. This caused the vehicle to travel over multiple lanes, depart the roadway, and ultimately crash into an entrance sign. Additionally, V1's statement conflicts with the final coding, suggesting that she may not have accurately recalled the sequence of events. The physics of a blowout indicate that the vehicle would pull to the left, not to the right as V1 claimed. This suggests that V1's panic and inexperience likely contributed to her incorrect response to the blowout. Therefore, V1's failure to properly control the vehicle after the blowout and her overcompensation in the opposite direction are the primary reasons for the accident.
