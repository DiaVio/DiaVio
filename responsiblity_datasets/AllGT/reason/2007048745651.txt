The driver of V1 stated that he was accelerating and getting up to speed when the trailer started to fishtail due to the wind gusts. Despite being aware of the windy conditions, the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and the trailer, resulting in the jackknifing of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly handle the vehicle in the given weather conditions.
