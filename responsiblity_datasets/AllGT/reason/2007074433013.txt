The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions (snow-covered travel lanes) and slick roads. The driver was traveling at a reduced speed and attempting to drive safely, but the fishtailing of the vehicle ultimately caused it to collide with V2's trailer. Additionally, an associative factor was that V1's tires were under-inflated, which may have contributed to the loss of control. V2 (the Freightliner tractor pulling the semi-trailer) was encroached upon by V1, but this encroachment was a result of V1's loss of control rather than any fault on the part of V2. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
