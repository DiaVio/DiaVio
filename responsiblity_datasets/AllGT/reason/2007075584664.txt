The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions and was unable to respond to the sudden braking of the non-contact vehicle in front of them. Additionally, the driver had limited experience driving on packed snow and was not familiar with the 2WD rental vehicle, which further contributed to their inability to adjust their speed and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
