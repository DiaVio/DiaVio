This is evident from the autopsy report, which listed the cause of death as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 crossed the centerline and entered the opposite lane, resulting in the collision.
