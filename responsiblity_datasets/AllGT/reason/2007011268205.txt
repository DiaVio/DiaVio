The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to drifting onto the paved shoulder, overcorrecting, and then crossing the left shoulder into the snow-covered, grassy median. This indicates a performance error of overcompensation and a recognition error of inattention, daydreaming on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver's medical condition of attention deficit disorder and the prescribed medications for the condition, as well as the use of birth control pills, may have contributed to the driver's inattentiveness and overcompensation. On the other hand, V2 (the 2002 Chrysler Pacifica) was traveling within the speed limit and attempted to avoid V1 by braking and steering right. The encroachment of V1 into the westbound lanes was an unexpected event for V2, making V2 less responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's performance error, recognition error, and potential influence of medical conditions and medications.
