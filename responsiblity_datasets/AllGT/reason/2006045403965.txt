The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 93kph (58mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 89kph (55mph). Additionally, V1 was driving in a curved section of the roadway that did not meet AASHTO standards for the posted speed limit. The driver of V1, who had only been driving this type of vehicle for four months, stated that he tapped the brakes just prior to impact, indicating that he may have been unable to properly control the vehicle in the curve. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and lack of experience in driving this type of vehicle, combined with the improper road geometry, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
