The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a spilled beverage in his vehicle. This distraction caused him to take his foot off the brake pedal, resulting in V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2. The driver's admission of being fatigued further suggests that he may not have been fully alert and focused on the road. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle encroachment-from crossing street, turning into same direction." This indicates that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and admission of fatigue, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
