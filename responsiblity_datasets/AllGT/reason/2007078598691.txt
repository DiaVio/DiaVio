The driver of V1 failed to come to a complete stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This driver was unfamiliar with the area, driving in total darkness with no lighting, and was distracted by trying to turn around. These factors contributed to the driver's failure to see and avoid V2, resulting in the collision.
