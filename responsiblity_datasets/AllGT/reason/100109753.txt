The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1, while attempting to make a left turn across the westbound lanes, failed to see V2, the 1998 Nissan Altima 4-door sedan traveling in the number-two lane. As a result, V1 entered the westbound lane and was struck on its left side by the front of V2, causing the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
