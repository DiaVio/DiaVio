The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, crossed over the lane-line, and departed the roadway. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, leading to the subsequent collision with the concrete median barrier and the rotation of the vehicle.
