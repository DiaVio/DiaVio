The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event coded for V1 - traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. This aggressive driving behavior likely contributed to V1 departing all the lanes to the left and colliding with V2. Additionally, it is important to note that V1 was driving a stolen vehicle and was being pursued by the police at the time of the collision. This further supports the conclusion that V1 bears primary responsibility for the accident. V2, on the other hand, was driving within their lane and was encroached upon by V1, which was traveling in the opposite direction and crossed over into V2's lane. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be a contributing factor to the collision.
