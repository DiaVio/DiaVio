The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver by disregarding the traffic signal at the intersection. This means that V1 failed to stop or yield when required, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2000 Ford Crown Victoria taxi) that was traveling northbound and had the right of way.
