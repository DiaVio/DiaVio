The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were turning left at an intersection and their view was obstructed by a legally parked van. V1 did not see V2 (the Toyota Sienna) prior to making the turn, which resulted in the collision. It is the responsibility of the driver making a left turn to ensure that it is safe to do so and to yield to oncoming traffic. In this case, V1 failed to do so due to the obstructed view, leading to the collision.
