The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling at an excessive speed while entering a left curve. This caused V1 to depart from the right side of the road and collide with a tree. The driver's inability to control the vehicle and maintain proper speed for the curve led to the accident. Additionally, the driver was not wearing a seat belt, which further contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
