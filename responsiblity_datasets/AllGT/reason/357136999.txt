The reason for this is that the injuries sustained by the 20-year-old female driver of the Chevrolet Cobalt sedan are consistent with contact with various parts of the Ford Taurus sedan, such as the upper B-pillar, lower B-pillar, lower rear quadrant of the right-front door, and the intruding right-front door. These injuries indicate that the impact was severe and that the driver of the Chevrolet Cobalt was subjected to multiple points of contact with the Ford Taurus, suggesting that the Ford Taurus was the primary cause of the accident.
