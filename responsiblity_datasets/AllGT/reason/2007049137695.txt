The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway on the left side and struck the post and cable traffic barrier. The driver stated that a truck in the second lane attempted to merge left into her lane, but she overcompensated by steering to the left and ended up leaving the roadway. This indicates that V1's actions, specifically the overcompensation, led to the crash.
