The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that they lost control of their vehicle, rotated clockwise, and ultimately rolled over, impacting V2 in the process. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 veered out of their lane. The critical reason for this event was assigned to V1 as a driver-related factor, specifically overcompensation. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Mercedes E 320) was not involved in the first harmful event, and the critical reason was not assigned to their vehicle. The driver of V2 mentioned that they were singing church songs with their daughter prior to the crash, suggesting that their actions did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their loss of control and veering out of their lane.
