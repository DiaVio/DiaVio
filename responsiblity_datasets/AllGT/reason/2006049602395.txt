The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver unintentionally ran a red light. Although the upper overhead traffic light was defective and showed an amber light instead of red, the lower pole mounted light was functioning normally and showed a red light. The driver of V1 admitted that he did not look at the lower pole mounted light and proceeded into the intersection, thinking he still had an amber light. This failure to observe the correct traffic signal and running a red light led to the collision with V2.
