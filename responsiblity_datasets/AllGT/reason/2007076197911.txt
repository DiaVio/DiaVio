The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 72-80 kmph (45-50 mph) on a dirt road with washboard conditions and negotiating a left curve. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was determined to be a driver-related factor, specifically driving too fast for the conditions of the road. Additionally, the driver's statement to the police confirms that the truck began to slide as he rounded the corner, indicating that the speed at which he was traveling was not appropriate for the road conditions. The refusal of the driver's father to allow his son to be interviewed and the vehicle to be inspected further suggests a lack of cooperation, which may indicate an attempt to avoid potential liability. Overall, the driver's excessive speed on a dirt road with washboard conditions and failure to negotiate the curve safely make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
