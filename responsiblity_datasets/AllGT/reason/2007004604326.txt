The reason for this is that V2 was distracted by her cell phone, taking her attention off the road and causing her to enter the intersection without noticing V1 attempting to make a left turn. V2's distraction and failure to yield to V1 resulted in the collision. Additionally, V2's attempt to avoid the collision by applying her brakes was not sufficient to prevent the accident.
