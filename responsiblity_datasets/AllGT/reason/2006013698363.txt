The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the Plymouth Caravan) and struck it in the rear. V1's driver stated that he saw V2 stopped ahead of him and attempted to change lanes but was unable to do so due to another vehicle in lane one. However, V1's driver failed to adequately avoid the collision by applying his brakes in time. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 was aware of V2's presence but still failed to stop in time. The associated factors coded to V1, including driver inexperience and a tire deficiency, further suggest that V1's driver was primarily responsible for the crash. On the other hand, V2's driver was waiting for traffic to clear in order to make a left turn into a parking lot and did not contribute to the crash. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with a higher speed," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stop in time and adequately avoid colliding with V2.
