The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection on a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a failure to stop for a traffic control device. Witnesses confirmed that V2 entered the intersection on a steady red signal. Since V2 failed to obey the traffic signal, it can be concluded that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
