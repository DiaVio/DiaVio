The reason for this is that V2 initiated a left turn in front of V1, causing the collision. V2 either did not see V1 or misjudged its travel speed. Additionally, the driver of V2 was unable to be interviewed, so the exact reason for the left turn is unknown. However, V2's action of turning left in front of oncoming traffic is a clear violation of traffic rules and is the main cause of the accident.
