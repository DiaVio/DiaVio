The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control by the driver. The driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 jumping the eastbound curb and impacting the fence before rolling over. The police report stated that the driver did not know why he departed the roadway, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle's direction. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, further supporting the driver's poor directional control. While the witness mentioned that the driver steered to the right in order to avoid another vehicle, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility. The driver's poor directional control and inability to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the crash.
