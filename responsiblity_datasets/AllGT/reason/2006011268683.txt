The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC) traveling eastbound in lane two. V1 stated that she could not see V2 approaching due to another van slowing down in lane one, but it is the responsibility of the turning vehicle to ensure that it is safe to make the turn before proceeding. Additionally, the driver of V1 was a 17-year-old with only two months of driving experience, which suggests inexperience and a lack of familiarity with traffic situations. The driver's inattention, as her focus was on a future event, further supports the notion that she failed to exercise proper caution while making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 was traveling near the speed limit and attempted to avoid the collision by braking, but was unable to do so. V2's actions do not appear to be a contributing factor to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn, inexperience, and driver inattention.
