The reason for this is that V1 was driving too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Suburban SUV) who had come to a quick stop. V1 did not see any brake lights from V2 and failed to maintain a safe distance between the vehicles, resulting in the collision. Additionally, an associative factor for the driver of V1 was fatigue, which may have impaired their ability to react quickly to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their excessive speed and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
