The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a right curve. The driver stated that the steering wheel turned to the left for unknown reasons, and when she tried to steer back right, the steering wheel locked, causing the vehicle to depart the roadway and ultimately flip over. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was determined to be the driver-related factor of driving too fast for the curve/turn. Therefore, based on the driver's excessive speed for the curve and the loss of control, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
