The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 was changing lanes and encroaching into V2's lane. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance," suggesting that the driver of V1 failed to adequately check for other vehicles, including V2, before changing lanes. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction) - over left lane line." However, the critical reason for this event was "not coded to this vehicle," indicating that V2's actions were not considered a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly surveil the surrounding traffic before changing lanes.
