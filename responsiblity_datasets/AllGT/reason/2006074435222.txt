The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they lost control of their vehicle due to poor road conditions (snow-covered roadway and standing water on the right side edge). This loss of control caused V2 to slide to the left and cross the center median, ultimately resulting in the collision with V1. While V1 was involved in the collision, their actions did not contribute to the cause of the accident. V1 was traveling in their designated lane and had the intention of going straight. The collision occurred when V2 encroached into the opposite lane due to their loss of control. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain control of their vehicle in adverse weather conditions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
