The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was making a left turn at the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic. V1 was stopped in the second lane, waiting to turn left, while V2 (the 1997 Plymouth Neon sedan) was traveling south in the first lane intending to go straight. V1 proceeded to turn left and was struck by the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, the absence of a stop sign at the intersection in V1's direction of travel does not absolve V1 of responsibility. When making a left turn, it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that it is safe to do so and yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while making a left turn at the intersection.
