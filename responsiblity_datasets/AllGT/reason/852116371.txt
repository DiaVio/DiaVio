The reason for this is that V2 locked up the brakes prior to entering the intersection, indicating that V2 was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 was either traveling at an excessive speed or failed to maintain a safe following distance, both of which are the responsibility of the driver. Additionally, the impact occurred on the left side of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection making a left turn.
