The driver of Vehicle #1 made a driver recognition error and was internally distracted while talking to her daughter about cupcakes for an upcoming birthday party. She failed to properly observe the approaching Vehicle #2 and turned right on a red light, pulling into the left lane in front of Vehicle #2. Although Vehicle #2 had the right-of-way and attempted evasive maneuvers, she was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle #1 for failing to yield and causing the collision.
