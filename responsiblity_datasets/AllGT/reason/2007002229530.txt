The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a bagel store and not noticing that the vehicle in front had stopped until it was too late. This distraction caused her to collide with the rear right of Vehicle #2 (the Mitsubishi Gallant). Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #1 was "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane, Other Vehicle Stopped," indicating that the driver failed to react in time to the stopped vehicle in front of her. On the other hand, the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #2 was "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane, Traveling in same Direction with Higher Speed." However, the Critical Reason for this event was not coded to Vehicle #2, suggesting that the driver of Vehicle #2 did not contribute to the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of distraction and failure to react in time, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
