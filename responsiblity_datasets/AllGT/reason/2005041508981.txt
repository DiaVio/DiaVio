The driver of V1 made a decision error by pulling out to turn left without adequately surveilling the approaching traffic in lane 3. Despite the obstructed view caused by the stopped vehicles in lanes one and two, the driver assumed that the way was clear because she was waved out by another driver. This decision error, along with the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway, led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 was already in the process of slowing down for the traffic light and could not see V1 coming from the parking lot due to a car blocking her view. While V2 had an associated factor of the impending problem being masked by the traffic flow pattern, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly assessing the situation and making a safe left turn.
