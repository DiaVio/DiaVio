The driver of V1 was distracted by his cell phone ringing and looking for a CD in the visor above him just prior to making the right turn. This distraction caused him to veer off the road and ultimately collide with the concrete water station. Additionally, the driver admitted to feeling a little drunk before the crash and mentioned that he had not slept for 4 hours. These factors likely impaired his judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the crash.
