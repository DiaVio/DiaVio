The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is a critical non-performance error. The physical evidence, such as the shallow departure angle of the vehicle and the fact that both the driver and passenger were found sleeping inside the vehicle at the scene, supports the conclusion that the driver drifted off the roadway due to sleep deprivation. The driver's claim of being cut off by another vehicle was not supported by the physical evidence or other details of the crash. Additionally, the driver was in the wrong travel lane for his intended destination, indicating a lack of familiarity with the roadway.
