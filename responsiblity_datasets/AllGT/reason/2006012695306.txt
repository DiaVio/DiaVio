The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and traveling too fast for the stop-and-go traffic flow. This resulted in V1 being unable to stop in time and rear-ending V2 (the Buick Riviera) which then caused V2 to collide with V3 (the GMC Sierra). Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to adjust their speed to the traffic conditions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
