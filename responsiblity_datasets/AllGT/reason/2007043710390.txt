The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed while attempting to turn left, which was too fast for the curve/turn. Additionally, there were numerous complaints of V1 traveling recklessly in the area prior to the crash, and a sheriff's deputy witnessed V1 passing him at a speed well above the posted limit. The driver's actions, including attempting to elude the police vehicle, indicate a disregard for traffic laws and safety. Furthermore, the driver's inexperience, being only 19 years old with 2-3 years of driving experience, likely contributed to the inability to control the vehicle at such high speeds.
