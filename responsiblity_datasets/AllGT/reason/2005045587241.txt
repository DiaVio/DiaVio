The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 (the 1998 Honda Accord) when attempting to turn left onto the four-lane road. Vehicle #1 stopped at the intersection before making the turn, but did not see Vehicle #2 approaching and pulled directly into its path. Additionally, the police issued a citation to the driver of Vehicle #1 for failure to yield, further indicating their responsibility in the accident.
