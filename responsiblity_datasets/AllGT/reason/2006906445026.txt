The reason for this is that V1 swerved to the left and crossed the dividing lane lines, entering the westbound traffic lane, ultimately colliding with V2 (the 1991 Honda Accord). V1's actions of crossing into oncoming traffic indicate a violation of traffic laws and a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's driver fled the scene of the crash and provided inconsistent information to the police, further suggesting negligence on their part. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in their designated lane and had just negotiated a left curve in the road when the collision occurred. The driver of V2 had no control over the actions of V1 and was not at fault for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their improper lane change and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
