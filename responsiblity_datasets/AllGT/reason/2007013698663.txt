The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The critical pre-crash event coded for V1 indicates that the vehicle traveled off the edge of the road on the left side, suggesting that the driver lost control due to excessive speed on the slush-covered road. This caused V1 to fishtail and ultimately collide with the guardrail before reentering the roadway and colliding with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1999 Freightliner) cannot be assigned primary responsibility as they were not involved in the first harmful event and did not contribute to the cause of the crash.
