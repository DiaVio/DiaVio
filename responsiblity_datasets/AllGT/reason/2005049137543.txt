The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had a seizure and lost consciousness prior to the impact. This physical impairment directly contributed to the collision, as V1's front impacted the rear of V2 (the 1999 Cadillac Catera sedan). The driver of V1 stated that he has no recall of the crash events, indicating that he was unable to control his vehicle due to his medical condition. Additionally, V1 received a citation for no driver's license, suggesting a lack of legal authorization to operate a vehicle.
