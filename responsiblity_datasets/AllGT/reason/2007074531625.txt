The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and crossed over (passed through) the intersection, which was the critical pre-crash event for V2. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." Additionally, the driver of V2 had been working long hours for the previous fourteen days, indicating possible fatigue as an associated factor in the crash.
