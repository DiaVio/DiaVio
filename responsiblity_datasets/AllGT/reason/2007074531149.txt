The reason for this is that V2, driven by a sixteen-year-old driver with only two months of driving experience, misjudged the gap between V1 and himself and attempted to cross the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2 was tired and unfamiliar with the route, which likely contributed to his misjudgment and inappropriate avoidance maneuver.
