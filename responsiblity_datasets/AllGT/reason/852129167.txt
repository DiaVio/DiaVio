The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the left onto the shoulder and grassy area, indicating a loss of control. V1 then attempted to steer back onto the roadway but started to rotate clockwise, suggesting that the left tires dug into the soft shoulder and grassy slope. This ultimately led to the rollover of V1. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not wearing a seat belt, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
