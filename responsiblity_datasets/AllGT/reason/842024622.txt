The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 crossed the centerline and entered the northbound lane, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 3 (1999 Mitsubishi 3000 GT 2-door hatchback). This initial impact caused both vehicles to rotate and subsequently collide with Vehicle 1 (2004 Chevrolet Aveo 4-door hatchback). Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 initiated the chain of events leading to the accident.
