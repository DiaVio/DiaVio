The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was found to have run a stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. The angle of the vehicles and the damage to both vehicles also support the conclusion that Vehicle 1 was intending to go straight across the intersection instead of making a right turn as claimed by the driver. Additionally, a witness stated that they saw Vehicle 1 traveling at a high rate of speed and not slowing down for the stop sign. Therefore, Vehicle 1's failure to stop at the stop sign and their illegal maneuver of crossing the intersection without yielding the right of way makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
