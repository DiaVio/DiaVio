The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the non-deployment of the available right instrument panel airbag contributed or was responsible for the severity of the injuries sustained by the case occupant. The injuries, including facial lacerations, subarachnoid hemorrhage with tonsillar herniation, vertebral fractures, rib fractures, liver laceration, pulmonary contusions and lacerations, pneumothorax, and hemomediastinum, were all a result of probable chest and abdomen contact with the right instrument panel during the frontal impact. The non-deployment of the airbag, which could have provided additional protection, increased the severity of these injuries.
