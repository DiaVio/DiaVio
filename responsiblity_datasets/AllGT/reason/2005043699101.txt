The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was observed drifting into the opposing travel lane, despite the driver of Vehicle 2 (the 2001 Ford F-150 4x2) taking evasive action by moving to the right side of his lane. Vehicle 1 continued to travel into Vehicle 2's direction and ultimately struck it on the left side. Additionally, Vehicle 1's driver has a troubled history, including a revoked driver's license, a known drug problem, and a history of being involved in trouble. The driver's behavior at the scene, including acting violently with EMS, raises further concerns about potential impairment. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Vehicle 1's driver's negligence in drifting into the opposing travel lane and potentially being impaired by drugs makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
