The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a decision error by turning left with an obstructed view. Although the driver of V1 checked for oncoming vehicles before crossing the eastbound lanes, she failed to see V2 approaching from the right at a high rate of speed. This indicates a failure to exercise proper caution and ensure that it was safe to proceed. As a result, V1 crossed into the path of V2, leading to the collision.
