The reason for this is that V2 was distracted by internal factors, specifically conversing with the occupant, and failed to notice that V1 and V3 were stopped ahead of them. This resulted in V2 colliding with the rear of V3, which then caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 tested positive for opiates, cocaine, and marijuana, indicating that the driver may have been impaired at the time of the crash. Therefore, V2's distraction and potential impairment contributed to the chain of events leading to the crash, making them primarily responsible.
