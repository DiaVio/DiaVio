The driver of V1 was primarily responsible because she was unable to negotiate the sharp left curve and lost control of her vehicle. She attempted to slow down by applying the brakes, but ended up sliding and ultimately veering off the right roadside. Her failure to maintain control of the vehicle and navigate the curve safely led to the collision with the trees and her partial ejection from the vehicle.
