The driver of V1 stated that she crested the hill and encountered sudden snowfall and icy road conditions. However, it is important to note that the road conditions 200 m prior to the crash were dry and there was no blowing snow. This suggests that the driver had some visibility and knowledge of the changing weather conditions. Additionally, the driver mentioned that she started to fishtail and applied full brakes. The vehicle was equipped with ABS, which should have helped in maintaining control. However, despite these measures, the driver lost control of the car and left the roadway, resulting in a rollover. The fact that the rear tires had very little tread depth (less than 1/32 of an inch) could have contributed to the loss of control on the icy road. It is the driver's responsibility to ensure that the vehicle is equipped with proper tires for the prevailing road conditions. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the condition of the vehicle's tires, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
