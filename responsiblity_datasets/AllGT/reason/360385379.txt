The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound in lane one of a two-lane roadway and crossed over into the southbound lane, ultimately departing the roadway and colliding with a tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their designated lane, resulting in the crash.
