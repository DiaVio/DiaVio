The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left turn in front of oncoming traffic without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver of V1 stated that all traffic was stopped waiting for pedestrians to cross, but failed to properly assess the situation and recognize that V2 was approaching in the opposite direction. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 had several contributing factors that may have affected their ability to safely operate the vehicle, including substance abuse program concerns, depression, bi-polar health issues, and possible side effects of prescribed medications. These factors could have impaired the driver's judgment and decision-making abilities. Overall, the driver of V1's failure to properly assess the situation, combined with the potential impairment from various factors, led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
