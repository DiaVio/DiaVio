The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Dodge Stratus, made a driver decision error by turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The large truck that was turning right obstructed the view of both drivers, but V2 proceeded into the intersection without being able to see oncoming traffic clearly. This decision ultimately led to the collision with V1, the Honda Accord.
