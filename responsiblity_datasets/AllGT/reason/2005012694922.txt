The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver admitted to being inattentive to the driving task and thinking about the vehicle he had just picked up. Additionally, there was a sight restriction caused by a non-contact vehicle parked on a lawn at the intersection, partially blocking the driver's view. These factors indicate that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
