The reason for this is that the driver fell asleep while operating the vehicle, which is a driver-related factor. The driver had only slept for 5.5 hours two nights before the crash and had been awake for 24 hours at the time of the accident. This lack of sleep and extended period of wakefulness likely impaired the driver's ability to stay alert and react appropriately while driving, leading to the vehicle veering off the road and ultimately rolling over.
