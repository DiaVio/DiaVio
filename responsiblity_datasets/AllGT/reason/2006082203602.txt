The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view. The driver of V1 stated that she could not see westbound lane one, indicating that she did not have a clear line of sight before making the left turn. This suggests that V1 failed to ensure it was safe to proceed with the turn, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1997 GMC Savana G-3500 van) was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any critical pre-crash events or reasons attributed to her. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to turning left with an obstructed view, while V2 does not bear primary responsibility based on the information provided.
