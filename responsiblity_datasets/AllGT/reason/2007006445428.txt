The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction while making a left turn. This distraction caused the driver to fail to maneuver around a support pillar and collide with it. The driver's admission of not paying attention to his turn due to the distraction establishes his responsibility for the accident. Additionally, the driver's use of prescription medication, wet roadway conditions, and rainy weather were contributing factors but do not absolve him of responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maneuver properly.
