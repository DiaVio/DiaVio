The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted out of its travel lane, crossed into the left turn lane, and continued to drift left as it entered the crossover area. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within their designated lane. The collision with the pole occurred as a result of Vehicle 1's continued leftward drift.
