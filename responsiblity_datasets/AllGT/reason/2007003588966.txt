The driver of V2 admitted to not stopping at the stop sign and failing to look to her right before the impact. This indicates a failure to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling northbound in lane one. Additionally, the driver of V2 was in a hurry and late for a business appointment, which may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and failure to stop at the stop sign. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance.
