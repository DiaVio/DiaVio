The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was making a left turn at the intersection onto the westbound road, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the 2001 Mack tractor with one trailer) was traveling east on the eastbound roadway and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to V2, resulting in the initial side impact between the two vehicles. Additionally, V1's subsequent impacts with the support pole of the house porch and the bridge rail indicate that it continued to lose control and veer off the intended path, further contributing to the accident. Overall, V1's failure to yield and subsequent loss of control make it primarily responsible for the multiple side impacts and resulting injuries.
