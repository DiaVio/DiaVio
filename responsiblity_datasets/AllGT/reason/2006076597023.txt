The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left-hand curve during heavy rain. The driver stated that the vehicle started to slide and she applied corrective steering, but the vehicle hydroplaned and ran off the left road edge, ultimately colliding with a tree. The fact that all four tires of the vehicle were underinflated may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle in adverse weather conditions.
