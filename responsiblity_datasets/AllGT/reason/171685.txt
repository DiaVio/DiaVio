The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver reportedly fell asleep while driving, causing V1 to drift off the left edge of the pavement. Additionally, upon regaining the roadway, V1 began a clockwise yaw, indicating a loss of control. These actions ultimately led to V1 crossing both lanes of travel, tripping over its left wheels, and rolling multiple times before coming to rest in a ditch. The driver's failure to stay alert and maintain control of the vehicle directly contributed to the accident.
