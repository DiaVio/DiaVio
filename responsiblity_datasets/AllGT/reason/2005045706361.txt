The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was making a left turn into the parking lot, and according to the Critical Pre-crash Event, the other vehicle (Vehicle #1) was turning left at the intersection. Vehicle #2 assumed that Vehicle #1 would yield the right of way, which was a false assumption. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 was relatively unfamiliar with the vehicle, indicating that it was a rental that she had picked up the day before. Therefore, Vehicle #2's false assumption and lack of familiarity with the vehicle contributed to the accident, making it primarily responsible.
