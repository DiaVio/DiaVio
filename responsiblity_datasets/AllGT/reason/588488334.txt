The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the roadway while changing lanes to the left, without yielding or giving enough space for Vehicle 1 to brake and avoid the collision. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver of Vehicle 2 to properly assess the traffic situation and yield the right of way to oncoming vehicles.
