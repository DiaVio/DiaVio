The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The driver of V1 did not see V2 approaching and was not aware of its presence until it was too late to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
