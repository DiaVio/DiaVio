The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not see V2, which was stopped on the shoulder and partially in the travel lane. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Although V2 was disabled and driverless, with its emergency flashers on, it is the responsibility of the driver of V1 to maintain proper surveillance and be aware of their surroundings. V1 should have been able to see V2 and take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
