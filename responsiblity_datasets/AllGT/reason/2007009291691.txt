The driver of V1 stated that she was traveling at a rate of 40 kmph (25 mph), which was below the posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph) and the advisory speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) at the point of impact. However, the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the right curve. This indicates that she was traveling too fast for the conditions, as stated in the Critical Pre-Crash Event and Critical Reason. Additionally, the wet roads and rain were associated factors that contributed to the loss of control. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to adjust their speed and driving behavior according to the road and weather conditions. In this case, the driver's decision error of traveling too fast for the curve and failing to maintain control of the vehicle led to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error and traveling too fast for the curve and conditions.
