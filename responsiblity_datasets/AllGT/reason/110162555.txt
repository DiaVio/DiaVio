The reason for holding the case occupant primarily responsible is that she was not wearing the available three-point seat belt, which could have significantly reduced the severity of her injuries. Additionally, her morbid obesity contributed to overloading the driver airbag and causing further injuries upon impact with V2. Her failure to wear a seat belt and the resulting injuries indicate a lack of proper precautions and responsibility on her part.
