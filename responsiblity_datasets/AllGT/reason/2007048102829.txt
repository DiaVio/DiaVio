The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the back of V2 (the 2002 Ford Taurus). V1's false assumption of V2's actions, thinking that V2 would continue through the yellow light, led to the collision. Additionally, V1's speed of 24 kmph (15 mph) indicates that they were not able to stop in time to avoid the collision, further suggesting that they were not maintaining a safe following distance. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise caution and maintain a safe following distance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
