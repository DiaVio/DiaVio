The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was operating the vehicle without proper supervision, as he was driving without his mother's permission and without a fully licensed driver accompanying him, as required by his driver's permit. Additionally, the driver admitted to driving too fast and being distracted by using a handheld cell phone just prior to the crash. These factors indicate a lack of responsible and safe driving behavior, leading to poor directional control and ultimately causing the vehicle to lose control and crash.
