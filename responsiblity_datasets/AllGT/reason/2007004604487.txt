The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 engaged in aggressive driving behavior by attempting to pass V2 (the 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible) over a double yellow centerline, which is an illegal maneuver. This aggressive driving behavior led to V1 crossing the double yellow line into oncoming traffic and ultimately causing the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to be an inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to their poor decision-making and inability to safely navigate the situation. The driver of V1 also failed to recognize the potential danger of their actions, as they were conversing with a passenger at the time. On the other hand, V2's driver was found to be driving while impaired with a reported BAC of 0.12, which is over the legal limit. While this is a contributing factor to the crash, V2's actions alone did not directly cause the collision. V2's involvement in aggressive driving, racing, and fighting for lane position during the merge may have escalated the situation, but it was ultimately V1's illegal maneuver and failure to safely re-enter the northbound lane that led to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their aggressive driving behavior, illegal maneuver, and failure to safely navigate the merging lanes.
