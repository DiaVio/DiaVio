The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: 1. V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions - The posted speed limit was 64 kph (40 mph), but the advisory speed limit for the left curve was 56 kph (35 mph). V1 failed to adjust their speed accordingly, considering the wet road surface and the presence of wet leaves, which reduced traction and increased the risk of losing control. 2. V1 exhibited poor directional control - V1's right tires initially departed the road slightly to the right, indicating a lack of proper control. Instead of correcting the vehicle's position, V1 overcorrected to the left, causing the vehicle to cross into oncoming lanes and ultimately leave the road on the left side. 3. V1 was under the influence of alcohol and amphetamine or similar stimulant drugs - The driver's aggressive behavior, belligerence towards the police, and previous convictions for driving while impaired suggest that V1 was impaired at the time of the accident. The influence of these substances likely impaired their judgment, reaction time, and overall driving ability. 4. V1's failure to call for police or understand their presence - V1's statement that they didn't call for police and didn't know why they were there indicates a lack of awareness and responsibility for their actions. This further supports the conclusion that V1 was not in a suitable condition to be driving. It is important to note that the vehicle was only partially inspected, so any potential vehicle deficiencies are unknown. However, based on the given information, V1's actions and behavior indicate their primary responsibility for the accident.
