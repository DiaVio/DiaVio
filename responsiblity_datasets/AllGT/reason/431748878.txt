The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection to turn left, across the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2012 Audi Q5), resulting in the impact between the two vehicles. Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight on the southbound lane of the state trafficway.
