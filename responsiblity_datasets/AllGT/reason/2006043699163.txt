The driver of V1 failed to stop for the red light and continued into the intersection, colliding with V2 as it began its left turn. V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and proceed through the intersection resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1's inadequate surveillance and tire deficiency, along with the rain and wet roads, were contributing factors to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop for the red light and their actions leading up to the collision.
