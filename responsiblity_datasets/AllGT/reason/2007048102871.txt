The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the turn. The driver of V1 admitted that she was looking left at her turn destination and did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance, which led to the collision. While V2 (the driver of the 1997 Mazda Protégé) did encroach over the left lane line, it is important to note that V1 had the responsibility to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic before making the left turn. V2's assumption that V1 would wait until the intersection was clear before making the turn can be seen as a contributing factor, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the oncoming traffic.
