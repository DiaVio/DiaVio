The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 67-year-old female, lost control and exited the roadway onto the grassy median. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, possibly due to a medical emergency. As a result, Vehicle 1 traveled a significant distance before colliding with a large tree, causing serious injuries to the driver.
