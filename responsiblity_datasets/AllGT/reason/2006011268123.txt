The reason for this is that V2, the city bus, made an unsafe lane change into lane one without properly checking for other vehicles. This action caused V1, the Ford Explorer, to collide with the back of V2. The witness statement supports this, stating that V2 cut in front of V1 and stopped suddenly, leaving V1 with no time to avoid the crash. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded to V2 indicates that the driver's inadequate surveillance and external distraction were contributing factors to the accident.
