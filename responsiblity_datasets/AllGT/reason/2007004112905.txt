The driver of V1 ran through the stop sign and was struck by V2 (the school bus) as it traveled through the intersection. The police officer on the scene concluded that V1 was heading straight through the intersection and ran the stop sign based on the other driver's statement, the vehicle damage, and the final rest of V1. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as "This vehicle traveling-crossing over (passing through) the intersection" with the Critical Reason being inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 also claimed to have difficulty seeing due to sun glare, which may have contributed to the accident.
