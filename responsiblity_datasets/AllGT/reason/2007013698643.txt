The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to pass V2 (the 1998 Toyota Camry) on the right side, which resulted in the contact between the two vehicles. This action indicates a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2, as stated in the Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded for V1. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 was unlicensed, which further contributes to their responsibility for the crash.
