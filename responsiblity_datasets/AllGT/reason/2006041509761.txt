The driver of V1 admitted to racing with the driver of V2 (the Toyota Matrix) just prior to the crash. This aggressive driving behavior, along with speeding and driving too fast for conditions, led to the loss of control and contact with V2. The driver of V1 was also inexperienced, having been driving for less than a year and not complying with the restrictions on his license. Additionally, the driver was not wearing his eyeglasses, which impaired his vision. Therefore, V1's decision error, aggressive driving behavior, and associated factors make them primarily responsible for the accident.
