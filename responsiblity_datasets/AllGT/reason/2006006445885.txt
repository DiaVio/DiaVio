The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was driving aggressively, as indicated by the Critical Reason for Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1, which was "Driver Related Factor: Aggressive driving behavior." Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted in the on-scene interview that he was driving too fast and had been participating in illegal street drag racing on the same roadway, which indicates a disregard for traffic laws and safety. The worn-out racing tires on V1's vehicle further contribute to the driver's negligence. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with the excessive speed and reckless maneuver of V1 moving from lane 3 to lane 1 in an attempt to pass V2 and V3, resulted in V1 striking the right curb and then colliding with V3. This initial impact caused V3 to rotate and collide with V2, ultimately leading to all three vehicles crossing the median and causing the subsequent collisions and damage. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving, excessive speed, and reckless maneuvering make them primarily responsible for the 3-vehicle crash.
