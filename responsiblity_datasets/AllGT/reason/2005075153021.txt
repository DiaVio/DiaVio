The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 64 kmph (40 mph), which is significantly higher than both the posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) and the advisory limit of 32 kmph (20 mph) for the road conditions (snow and ice present). This indicates that the driver was speeding too fast for the poor road conditions, which ultimately led to the loss of control and the subsequent collision with the wooden fence. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed for the prevailing road conditions.
