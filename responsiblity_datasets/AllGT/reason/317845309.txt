The reason for this is that V2 drifted over the left lane line and its left tires departed the roadway onto the left roadside. The driver of V2 noticed this and attempted to steer right and brake to bring the vehicle back onto the road. However, during this maneuver, V2 collided with V1 (the 2010 Honda Accord) which was traveling in the southbound lane. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain its lane and control of the vehicle resulted in the collision with V1, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
