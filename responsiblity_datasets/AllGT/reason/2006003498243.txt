The driver of V1 stated that his right foot fell asleep, causing him to depress both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time when he intended to stop. This resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2 (the Ford Explorer), which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3 (the Jeep Grand Cherokee). The driver of V1's performance error of having his foot caught under the brake pedal led to the chain reaction of collisions.
