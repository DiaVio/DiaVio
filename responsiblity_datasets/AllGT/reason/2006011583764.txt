The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the Mitsubishi Eclipse) while attempting to turn left at the intersection. V1 admitted that he saw V2 approaching but thought he had enough time to complete his left turn. However, V1 did not have enough time to get into the southbound lanes, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 was emotionally distracted due to a family problem, specifically his wife being hospitalized with terminal cancer. This emotional distraction may have affected his judgment and ability to accurately assess the oncoming traffic. Furthermore, V1 was not familiar with the roadway, having only driven on it once before. This lack of familiarity with the road may have contributed to his misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2. In contrast, V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and attempted to avoid the collision by braking hard and steering to the left. However, V2 was unable to avoid the collision with V1. Therefore, based on the given information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, emotional distractions, and lack of familiarity with the roadway.
