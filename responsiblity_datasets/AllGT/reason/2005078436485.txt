The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a blowout/flat tire. The left rear tire may not have been seated correctly against the wheel on the inside or was somehow damaged while in transit. This resulted in the vehicle shaking violently, causing the driver to slow down and ultimately lose control. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as a vehicle-related factor: Tires/wheel failed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the tire failure and subsequent loss of control.
