The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 attempted to change lanes across the path of Vehicle 1, resulting in the impact between the front right area of Vehicle 2 and the left side surface of Vehicle 1. This impact caused moderate damage to Vehicle 1 and induced a counterclockwise rotation, leading to the subsequent rollover. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 in changing lanes without yielding to the right of way of Vehicle 1 caused the accident.
