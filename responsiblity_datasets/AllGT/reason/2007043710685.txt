The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite looking, the driver did not see V2 approaching and proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in the collision. The driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the accident.
