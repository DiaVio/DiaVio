The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, which indicates that V2 had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V1, the 2007 Chrysler 300 Touring four door sedan, was traveling straight in its lane and had the right of way. V1 attempted to avoid the collision by braking, but V2 failed to yield and collided with the front of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and make a safe left turn makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
