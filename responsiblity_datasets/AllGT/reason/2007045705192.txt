The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 was attempting to turn left across V1's path, which is a risky maneuver. V2 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and did not see V1 approaching. Additionally, V2 was distracted by looking at her intended turn destination, which further contributed to her failure to notice V1. V2's lack of experience on the road and her fatigue from a regular lack of sleep also played a role in the accident.
