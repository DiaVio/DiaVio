The reason for this is that V1 was turning left onto the main road from the side street, and V2 (the driver of the Volkswagen Jetta) was already southbound in the second lane of the main road. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the police report mentioned that the driver of V1 was constantly on the cell phone following the crash, although it is unknown if the phone was in use during the crash itself. This suggests a possible distraction on the part of the V1 driver, further supporting their responsibility for the collision.
