The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was under the influence of alcohol, as indicated by the strong smell of alcohol detected by the bus driver and the driver's subsequent refusal to take a BAC test. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a lower speed than the posted speed limit and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, resulting in a collision with the back of the bus. The driver's claim that the bus suddenly slammed its brakes without warning is not supported by any evidence or witness statements.
