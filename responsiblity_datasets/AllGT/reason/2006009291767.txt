The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was attempting to turn left into a driveway, but failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the turn. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and critical reason coded for V2, which indicate that the driver of V2 did not look or failed to see the oncoming vehicle in the southbound lane. Additionally, the driver of V2 was inexperienced and unfamiliar with the roadway, which likely contributed to the failure to properly assess the situation before initiating the left turn.
