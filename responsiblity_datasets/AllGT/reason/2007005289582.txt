The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was approaching the intersection from the westbound roadway controlled by a stop sign. V2 claimed that V1 stopped in the middle of the intersection, but this is contradicted by the evidence of V2's skid marks, indicating that V2 attempted to brake upon seeing V1. V2's failure to avoid the collision suggests that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to anticipate the actions of other drivers. Additionally, V2's statement that he saw the driver of V1 with a "deer in headlights" expression indicates that V2 had the opportunity to perceive the potential danger and take appropriate evasive action, but failed to do so. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and failure to exercise proper caution make them primarily responsible for the accident.
