The reason for this is that V2 attempted to pass a non-contact vehicle while negotiating a curved section of roadway. V2 crossed the center lane lines and traveled into the eastbound lane, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2005 Ford F250 Super Cab large pickup. This action by V2 caused the initial impact and subsequent chain of events, including the rollover of V1 and the serious injuries sustained by the occupants of both vehicles. Therefore, V2's decision to pass in an unsafe manner and cross into oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
