The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was stopped at the intersection and proceeded to cross the intersection without yielding the right of way to Vehicle 1 (the 2015 Toyota Corolla). Vehicle 1 was already in the intersection when the collision occurred, indicating that Vehicle 2 failed to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic.
