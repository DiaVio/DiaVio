The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, causing it to rotate clockwise and eventually collide with V2 (the 2004 Ford F350 DRW 4X2). The driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol concentration of .19%, which is significantly above the legal limit. This indicates that the driver was impaired at the time of the crash, which likely contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision. Additionally, it could not be determined if the driver of V1 was using any restraints due to the severity of the fire damage.
