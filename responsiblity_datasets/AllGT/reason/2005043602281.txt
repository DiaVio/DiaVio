The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely behind V2 (the 1994 Nissan Sentra) and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision when V2 came to a stop due to the large truck decelerating. The driver of V1 admitted to not having enough gap distance between their vehicle and V2, indicating a lack of proper following distance. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle in lane stopped" and the Critical Reason was coded as "driver inattention." This suggests that V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and the actions of the vehicles ahead, which contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to following too closely and driver inattention.
