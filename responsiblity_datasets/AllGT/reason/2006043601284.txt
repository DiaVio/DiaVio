The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the Chevrolet Impala, made a left turn in front of V2, the driver of the Chrysler Town & Country, without ensuring that the roadway was clear. V1 admitted to having an obstructed view due to an unknown vehicle that had stopped in its lane to allow V1 to make the left turn. However, it is the responsibility of the turning driver (V1) to ensure that it is safe to proceed before making the turn. V1 failed to do so and collided with V2, causing the accident.
