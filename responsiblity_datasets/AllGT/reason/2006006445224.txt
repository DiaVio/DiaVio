The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and making frequent lane changes, which can be considered aggressive driving. Additionally, V1 had dangerously low tread on all four tires and a missing lug nut on the right front tire. These factors contributed to the tire blowout and subsequent loss of control, causing V1 to roll over and crash. Furthermore, the driver and passenger of V1 fled the scene after the crash, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability.
