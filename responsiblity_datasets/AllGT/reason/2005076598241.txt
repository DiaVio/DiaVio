The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 (the 1985 Ford pickup) and collided with the rear of V2. V1's statement that she looked away and was distracted by a conversation with the passenger indicates a lack of attention to the road and surrounding traffic. Additionally, V1's speed of 24 kmph (below the posted speed limit) suggests that she was not able to react in time to the slowing or stopping of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and her distracted driving are the primary factors contributing to the crash.
