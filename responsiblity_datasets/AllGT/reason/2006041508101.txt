The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by paperwork inside the vehicle, which led to a recognition error and a failure to notice the stopped vehicles ahead. Additionally, the driver was in a hurry and running late for a court appearance, which may have contributed to his inattention. The driver's claim of brake failure was discounted, as there was no evidence of any brake deficiencies. Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention to the roadway and the presence of internal distractions led to the sideswiping of V2 and subsequent collisions with V3, V4, V5, and V6.
