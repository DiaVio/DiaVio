The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling in the wrong direction in the northbound lane, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. - Witnesses tried to alert V1 by honking their horns and flashing their lights, indicating that V1 had ample opportunity to recognize their mistake and correct their course. - V1's failure to recognize that they were traveling in the wrong direction for a distance of two miles demonstrates a significant recognition error. - The presence of warning signs, including "wrong way" and "one-way" signs, further emphasizes that V1 should have been aware of their mistake. While V2 (the driver of the 1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickup traveling in the correct direction) was also involved in the accident, their responsibility is not explicitly mentioned in the case summary. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the head-on collision.
