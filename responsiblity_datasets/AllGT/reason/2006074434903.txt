The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1's driver had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .307, which is significantly above the legal limit. - The driver admitted to consuming alcohol after a job interview and may have passed out due to alcohol consumption, leading to a lack of control over the vehicle. - V1's driver was distracted by constantly talking to his daughter and looking at her in the rearview mirror while driving. - V1's vehicle had several tires with low tire pressure and low tread depths, which could have contributed to the lack of control. Overall, V1's driver's impaired state, distraction, and lack of control over the vehicle due to alcohol consumption make them primarily responsible for the crash.
