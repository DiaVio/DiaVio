The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," and the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related decision factor: too fast to respond to unexpected actions of the other vehicle. This indicates that V2 was traveling at a speed that was too fast to respond to the sudden stop of V1, resulting in the collision between the two vehicles. Therefore, V2's failure to adjust their speed and react appropriately to the situation makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
