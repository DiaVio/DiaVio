The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop in time and collided with the back of V2 (the 2004 Honda Civic). The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and not perceiving the critical situation of traffic slowing down. This inattention, combined with factors such as lack of experience driving on that roadway and no formal driver education, contributed to V1's failure to stop in time and avoid the collision.
