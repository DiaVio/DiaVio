The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to driving over the center of the roadway and speeding up in response to another driver's behavior. This decision to speed up and the subsequent loss of control resulted in Vehicle #1 going off the right side of the roadway and colliding with a tree. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, having only had his license for two weeks, and the presence of two friends in the car may have contributed to inattention and inadequate evasive action. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the police's assessment of the situation, Vehicle #1 is considered primarily responsible for the crash.
