The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed that was deemed excessive for the conditions and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the back of V2 (the 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse). The investigating officer indicated that the driver of V1 was exceeding a reasonable safe speed, which suggests that V1's speed was a contributing factor to the accident.
