The reason for this is that V1 steered left to avoid a non-contact vehicle that changed lanes into lane three. As a result, V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway, struck the jersey barrier, and then returned to the roadway, colliding with V2 (the 1995 Honda Civic). V1's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control led to the collision with V2. V2, on the other hand, was not involved in the first harmful event and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the accident.
