The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 crossed the center lane divider and entered the southbound travel lane heading north, causing a frontal impact with Vehicle 3. This initial impact caused Vehicle 3 to lose control and veer off the roadway. Vehicle 2 then continued to travel north in the southbound lane and was subsequently struck on its right side by the frontal impact of Vehicle 1. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 2 in crossing into oncoming traffic initiated the chain of events that led to the collision.
