The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver panicked and stepped on the gas without thinking of the consequences when she believed she was being attacked. This caused her to enter the intersection without looking and crash into V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not familiar with the vehicle she was driving and had rarely driven on this road before, which may have contributed to her lack of awareness and ability to handle the situation properly. Furthermore, there was no child safety seat for the 4-year-old child in V1, indicating a violation of safety regulations.
