The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 was in the left turn lane and proceeded with the left turn, assuming that V2 was going to turn right onto the entrance ramp. However, V2 was actually traveling straight in lane two. This false assumption led to V1 entering the intersection at the same time as V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to properly assess the situation make them primarily responsible for the accident.
