The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adjust their driving behavior to the poor road conditions caused by the heavy rain. Despite being familiar with the roadway and driving it daily, the driver did not take appropriate precautions such as reducing speed or finding a safe place to pull over. This lack of caution resulted in the vehicle hydroplaning and the driver losing control, ultimately leading to the rollover accident.
