The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that she didn't notice the oncoming pickup and applied the brakes but couldn't avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver was fatigued after driving for eight hours and had a large amount of luggage and her cats in the vehicle with her. These factors likely contributed to her failure to adequately surveil the intersection and avoid the collision.
