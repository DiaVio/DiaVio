The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of the minivan lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve. The driver overcorrected to the left, causing the vehicle to depart the roadway a second time and roll onto its left side. The driver stated that she was not completely comfortable with the handling of the minivan, particularly due to its high center of gravity. This indicates a performance error of poor directional control on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver mentioned that loose cargo items were tumbling all over the place during the rollover, suggesting that the vehicle may not have been properly secured or loaded. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and lack of comfort with the vehicle's handling.
