The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and was unable to brake in time to avoid a collision. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by the presence of a police car with flashing lights and sirens, which caused a traffic flow interruption. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to maintain control of their vehicle and adjust their driving behavior accordingly, even in the presence of distractions. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been licensed in the US for approximately 14 months and admitted to listening to the radio while driving. These factors suggest a lack of experience and potential distraction, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to brake in time. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2002 Honda Civic) cannot be held primarily responsible as there is no evidence to suggest that they were at fault. The only associated factor that could be coded to the driver of V2 was the traffic flow interruption caused by the approaching police vehicle, which was beyond their control. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and inability to brake in time, potentially caused by distractions and lack of experience.
