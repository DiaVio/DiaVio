The driver of V1 failed to reduce their speed and collided with the rear of V2 (the driver of the 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup truck) who had slowed down to avoid hitting a dog on the roadway. V1's driver claimed they did not see V2 in front of them and attributed it to the cloudy, rainy conditions. However, the driver's failure to recognize the presence of a vehicle directly in front of them indicates driver inattention and a recognition error. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions, as they were driving at the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph) in a rainy environment. The driver's illness, medication use, and the fact that they were eating while driving may have also contributed to their inability to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to reduce speed, inattention, and driving too fast for the conditions.
