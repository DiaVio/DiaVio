The reason for this is that V2 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which is a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, V2's critical reason for the accident was coded as "view obstructed by other vehicles," indicating that V2's visibility was compromised due to the parked vans on the right side of the road. While V1 (the Toyota Tacoma) claims that V2 was driving at a high rate of speed, it is important to note that both vehicles were reported to be traveling at the same speed of 32 kmph. Therefore, V2's failure to stay within its lane and the obstruction of its view by the parked vans are the main factors contributing to the accident.
