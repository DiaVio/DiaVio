The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that he was looking left to check for pedestrians, but he did not see V1 approaching from the opposite direction. This failure to look far enough ahead and properly assess the intersection led to the collision with V1.
