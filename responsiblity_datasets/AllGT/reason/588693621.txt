The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling straight in the eastbound through lane, while Vehicle 2, the 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 large pick-up truck, was in the left turn lane intending to turn left at the intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the front right corner area of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way to make a left turn.
