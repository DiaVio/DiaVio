The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not realize that V2 (the driver of the 2006 Mazda 3 sedan) was approaching until V1 had already started turning left. This failure to adequately survey the intersection and properly assess the oncoming traffic led to the collision.
