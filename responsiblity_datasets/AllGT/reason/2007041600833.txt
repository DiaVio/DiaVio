The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she attempted to make a left turn from lane four, which was a left turn only lane, while V2 (the driver of the Chevy 1500 truck) was approaching the intersection with a green light in lane one. V1's action of turning left in front of oncoming traffic violated the right of way of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's claim that V2 ran a red light is contradicted by the fact that V2 had a green light and was approaching the intersection when the collision occurred. The officer on the scene also cited V2 for the crash, further supporting V1's primary responsibility. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to her failure to yield the right of way and attempting a left turn in front of oncoming traffic.
