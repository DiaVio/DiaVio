The reason for this is that V1 was parked legally on the right side of the southbound road and made a u-turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord). V2 attempted to brake and steer left to avoid the collision, but was unable to do so. V1's action of making a u-turn without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic is considered inadequate surveillance and is the critical reason for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly check for oncoming traffic before making the u-turn.
