The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which caused the vehicle to hydroplane on the wet road. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation while trying to avoid another vehicle led to the loss of control and subsequent rollover of V1. The driver's admission of traveling slightly over the speed limit, along with other associated factors such as conversation with passengers, unfamiliarity with the roadway, and the weather conditions, further support V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
