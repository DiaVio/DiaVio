The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve, causing V1 to travel into the northbound lane and go into a clockwise yaw. V1 then reentered the southbound lane and departed the roadway to the right, ultimately tripping and rolling over to the left. The impact with a large tree on V1's left side and top resulted in moderate damage and further rotation before coming to a final rest on its left side. This sequence of events indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the rollover and subsequent impact with the tree.
