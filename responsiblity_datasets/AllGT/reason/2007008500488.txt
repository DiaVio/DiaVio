The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to bring the vehicle to a safe speed to negotiate the curve with wet roads. The driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which were characterized by wet roadways due to rain/snow. Additionally, the fact that the rear tires on the vehicle were worn to 2mm could have contributed to the loss of control. Although the driver initially claimed that something on the vehicle possibly the sway bar broke, this claim could not be proven. Furthermore, the driver's claim of black ice was also not substantiated as no black ice was found. The possibility of the driver being intoxicated at the time of the crash cannot be verified due to contaminated test results.
