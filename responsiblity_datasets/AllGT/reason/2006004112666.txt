The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 17-year-old female, drifted off the roadway multiple times before ultimately crashing into a tree. The witness in a non-contact vehicle reported seeing V1 drift off the road to the left, re-enter the roadway, and then drift to the right before departing the roadway on the right side. This indicates a lack of control and attention on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver admitted to not remembering the accident at all, which suggests a possible lapse in consciousness or attention. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, with the critical reason being a driver-related factor of sleeping, indicating that the driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel. Associated factors such as fatigue, pregnancy, and driver inexperience were also coded for the driver of V1. The driver mentioned working two jobs, being a full-time high school student, and only getting about 5 hours of sleep the night prior to the accident. These factors likely contributed to her fatigue and reduced ability to focus on the road. Overall, the combination of drifting off the road multiple times, not remembering the accident, and the presence of fatigue, pregnancy, and driver inexperience indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
