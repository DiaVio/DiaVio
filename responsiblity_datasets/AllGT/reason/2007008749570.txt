The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the wrong lane, drifting into the eastbound lane where V2 was stopped. The driver of V1 attempted to steer and brake to avoid the collision, but the lack of power steering and braking made it impossible for him to do so. The engine failure in V1 caused the vehicle to stall and drift into the oncoming lane, resulting in the collision with V2.
