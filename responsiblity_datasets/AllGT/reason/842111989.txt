The reason for this is that V2, while eastbound through the controlled intersection, impacted the right side of V1, forcing it laterally to the east side of the intersection. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was proceeding straight through the intersection. Additionally, the fact that V2 had locked up the brakes through the impact suggests that V2 was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision, further indicating negligence on the part of the driver of V2.
