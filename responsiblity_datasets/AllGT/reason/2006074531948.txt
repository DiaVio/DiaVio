The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, and according to the critical pre-crash event, V2 encroached over the left lane line of the opposite direction. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, including V1. As a result, the front of V2 struck the front of V1.
