The driver of Vehicle 2 allowed the vehicle to depart the right pavement edge onto the grass shoulder and then attempted to re-enter the road by steering left. This maneuver caused Vehicle 2 to rotate counterclockwise and traverse the travel lanes, crossing the path of Vehicle 1 (2008 Hyundai Tiburon). The frontal area of Vehicle 2 impacted the front right area of Vehicle 1, resulting in severe damage. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, specifically the failure to maintain control of the vehicle and re-enter the road safely, led to the collision with Vehicle 1 and subsequent rollover.
