The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the argument between her friend and the child in the back seat. This distraction caused her to turn around and pick up a toy from the floor while driving, leading her to enter the opposite lane. Although she quickly realized her mistake and steered back into her original lane, it was too late to avoid the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper lane position make her primarily responsible for the accident.
