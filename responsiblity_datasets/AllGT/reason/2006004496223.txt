The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by adjusting the radio and not seeing V2 (the Mazda Protégé sedan) until the last minute. This distraction caused V1 to swerve and brake, but ultimately resulted in the collision with the back of V2. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed between 66 and 80 KMPH (41-50 MPH), which may have contributed to the severity of the impact. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them make them primarily responsible for the accident.
