The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and began rotating counter-clockwise, ultimately striking the curb of the median and causing the right rear tire to separate from the rest of the vehicle. The driver's claim of hitting standing water from sprinklers as the cause of losing control is deemed unlikely, as the water was more than 50 meters back from the crash site. Additionally, the police reported that V1 was seen racing another vehicle before losing control, indicating a decision error and aggressive driving on the part of the driver. The driver's age and inexperience, being only seventeen and relatively new to driving this vehicle, are also associated factors contributing to V1's primary responsibility.
