The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that the driver of V1 did not properly observe the stopped vehicle in front of them, leading to the collision. While V2 (the driver of the 2000 Toyota Rav4) was also involved in the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident, as they were stopped and waiting to turn left at a driveway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the road ahead and notice the stopped vehicle in time to avoid a collision.
