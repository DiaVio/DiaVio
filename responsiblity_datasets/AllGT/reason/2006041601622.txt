The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2, the 1998 International tractor-trailer). This is evident from the fact that V1 rear-ended V2 when it came to a stop. The driver of V1 admitted to not realizing he was following too closely and slammed on his brakes in an attempt to stop, but was unsuccessful. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued at the time of the crash, having only slept four hours, which likely contributed to his driver-related recognition error and inattention. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe following distance, driver inattention, and fatigue.
