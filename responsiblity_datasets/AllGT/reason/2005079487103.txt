The driver of V2 executed a U-turn without properly observing the approaching traffic, including V1 (the driver of the Honda Accord). The driver of V2 reported that he did not see V1 prior to the crash and was not aware of its presence. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned being fatigued at the time of the crash, which could have impaired his ability to properly assess the traffic situation. Therefore, V2's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic, as well as the recognition error and inadequate surveillance, make V2 primarily responsible for the collision.
