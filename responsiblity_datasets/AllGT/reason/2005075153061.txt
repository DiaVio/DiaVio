The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which was the critical pre-crash event. This driver-related factor of being asleep directly led to V1 crossing over the double yellow line into the east lane and subsequently impacting two parked vehicles. The driver's fatigue, possibly caused by having to wake up early and being nervous about the fog at her destination, contributed to her falling asleep while driving.
