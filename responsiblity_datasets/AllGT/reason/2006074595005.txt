The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the left lane of the opposite direction, which caused the collision with V1. V1 was waiting to turn left and had the right of way, assuming that V2 would stop to allow the turn. However, V2 failed to stay within their lane and crossed over into the left lane, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain their lane and encroaching into the opposite direction's lane is the main reason for the accident.
