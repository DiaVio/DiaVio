The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to merge into lane two in front of V1, but failed to complete the maneuver and was struck by V1. The physical evidence of the damage pattern to the vehicles supports this scenario. Additionally, the driver of V2 was found to be inattentive to the driving task due to a conversation with the passenger and was daydreaming at the time of the collision.
