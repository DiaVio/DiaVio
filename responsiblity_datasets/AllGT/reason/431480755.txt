The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to observe the traffic congestion ahead and subsequently rear-ended Vehicle 2. This initial impact caused a chain of secondary impacts involving Vehicles 2, 3, and 4. Vehicle 1 then entered the path of Vehicle 5, resulting in severe back damage to Vehicle 1. Finally, Vehicle 1 struck the W-beam guardrail and spun counterclockwise before being impacted again by Vehicle 5. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to observe the stopped traffic ahead and maintain a safe distance.
