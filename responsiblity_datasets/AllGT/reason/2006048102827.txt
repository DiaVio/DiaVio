The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was traveling behind V2 in the same lane and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a rear-end collision. - V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph, which was the same as V2, indicating that V1 did not adjust their speed to match the traffic conditions. - The witness stated that the driver of V1 was looking straight ahead, suggesting a lack of attention or awareness of the slowing traffic ahead. - Additionally, the driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .206, indicating impairment and potentially affecting their ability to react to the situation. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
