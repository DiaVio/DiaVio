The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by his cell phone, which caused him to take his attention away from the road. As a result, he failed to recognize that the traffic ahead had stopped and rear-ended V2 (the Kenworth tractor-trailer). This distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the driving task led to the collision.
