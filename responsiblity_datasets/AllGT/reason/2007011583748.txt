The driver of V1 admitted to stopping in the southbound through lane to retrieve their mail and then attempting to turn left into their driveway. However, they failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the turn. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being "inadequate surveillance" and the associated factors of the driver of V1 failing to look or look but not see. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within their lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that they were unable to avoid the collision as V1 suddenly pulled across their lane. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction-over the left lane line," indicating that V1 encroached into V2's lane. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
