The critical reason for the collision was assigned to V1 because it proceeded into the intersection without yielding the right-of-way to V2 (the black 2006 Nissan Maxima). V1 crossed through the intersection without sufficient clearance, causing the collision with V2. The driver of V1 did not make any avoidance actions prior to the crash, indicating a lack of awareness or failure to properly assess the situation.
