The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver made a recognition error due to internal distraction. The driver was conversing with her son before recognizing the impending problem of the two vehicles in front of her braking. This distraction caused her to swerve right and ultimately slide off the edge of the road, resulting in the crash. Additionally, inadequate surveillance (failure to look far enough ahead) was also a contributing factor to the recognition error.
