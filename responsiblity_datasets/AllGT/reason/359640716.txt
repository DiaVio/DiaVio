The reason for this is that V1 was traveling north in lane one and began to move out of its travel lane to the right, crossing over a bike lane and into the parking lane. V1 then collided with the illegally parked and unoccupied Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal and side curtain airbags. V1 underrode V2's back end and pushed it in a northwesterly direction. Additionally, after striking V2, V1 sideswiped a guardrail adjacent to the east parking lane, resulting in minor damage. V1 came to a final rest in the parking lane, facing north. Therefore, V1's failure to stay within its travel lane and colliding with the illegally parked V2 indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
