The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 64-72 kmph (40-45 mph) on a sharp left curve with an advisory speed of 32 kmph (20 mph). This indicates that the driver was going too fast for the curve, which is identified as the critical reason for the critical event. The driver's statement that he "didn't negotiate the curve" further supports this conclusion. Additionally, the driver's medical history and the fact that he takes numerous medications daily raise the possibility that his health conditions or medication may have contributed to the crash. However, without further information or evidence, it cannot be definitively determined if these factors played a role in the crash.
