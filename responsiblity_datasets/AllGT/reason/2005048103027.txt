The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "crossing over (passing through) intersection" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to V1 as an "illegal maneuver." This indicates that V1 was attempting to cross the five-lane highway without yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic. As a result, V1's vehicle impacted the left side of V2 (the 1998 Toyota Rav-4) which was traveling southbound in lane one. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." However, the critical reason was not attributed to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident and was simply in the path of V1's illegal maneuver. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their illegal maneuver of crossing the intersection without yielding the right of way.
