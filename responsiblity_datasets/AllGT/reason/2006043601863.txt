The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic while making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that he stopped at the intersection and waited for traffic to clear before making the turn. However, he failed to notice V2 approaching in the westbound lane and proceeded to turn left, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with his passenger, which can be considered as inattention and a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way and inattention while making the left turn.
