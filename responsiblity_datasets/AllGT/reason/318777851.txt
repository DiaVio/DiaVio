The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 began prematurely turning left at the intersection before reaching the appropriate lane of travel, crossing the center line into Vehicle 1's lane of travel. This action by Vehicle 2 caused the full frontal impact between the two vehicles, resulting in severe damage and injuries.
