The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and departed the right side of the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver stated that he tried to avoid the crash by braking and steering to the right, but was unable to bring the vehicle to a stop in time. Factors contributing to V1's responsibility include following too closely to the vehicle in front, which led to the sudden need for evasive action when that vehicle slammed on its brakes. Additionally, the presence of a shallow stream of water stretching across the roadway may have hindered the flow of traffic, causing drivers to slow down and creating a traffic flow restriction. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their speed and maintain control of the vehicle in such conditions. No mechanical defects were reported with V1's vehicle, and the driver claimed to be well-rested and in good health, indicating that there were no external factors contributing to the driver's inability to avoid the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and incorrect evasive action in response to the sudden braking of the vehicle in front.
