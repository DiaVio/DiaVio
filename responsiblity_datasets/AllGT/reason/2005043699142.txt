The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V3 (the lead vehicle) and failed to stop in time to avoid striking the back of V3. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was a recognition error: driver inattention. This indicates that the driver of V2 was not paying enough attention to the road and the traffic ahead, leading to the collision. Additionally, V1 (the driver of the Hyundai Elantra) is not primarily responsible for the crash as they were not involved in the initial impact between V2 and V3. V1's collision with the back of V2 was a result of V2 suddenly stopping, which was the primary fault of V2. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stop in time and their driver inattention.
