The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign prior to entering the intersection, which is an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic control devices. Additionally, V1 was fleeing the scene of a previous crash, indicating aggressive and reckless behavior. The driver of V1 also had a history of being involved in another crash just minutes before, suggesting a pattern of unsafe driving. V2 (the Subaru Legacy) attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, indicating that the driver was taking appropriate actions to prevent the crash. However, due to V1's failure to stop, V2 was unable to avoid being struck. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their illegal maneuver, aggressive behavior, and failure to stop at the stop sign.
