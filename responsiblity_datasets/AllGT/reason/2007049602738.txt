The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2 (the Ford F-150 pick-up) and failed to maintain a safe distance. V1 assumed that V2 would continue in lane three and did not anticipate V2's deceleration due to the non-contact vehicle in front. Additionally, V1's aggressive honking of the horn out of frustration suggests a lack of attentiveness and a failure to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and their aggressive behavior contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
