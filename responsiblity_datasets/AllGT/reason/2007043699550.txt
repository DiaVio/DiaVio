The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, resulting in V1 drifting off the road and causing the crash. The driver's admission of being fatigued, combined with the fact that she had been involved in strenuous activities for the week prior, suggests that driver fatigue played a significant role in the accident. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway (as she rarely drives on it) may have contributed to her inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's fatigue and falling asleep while driving.
