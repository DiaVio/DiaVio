The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling eastbound on the curved section of the roadway and entered the westbound travel lane, causing a head-on collision with Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to brake and steer left to avoid the collision, but was unsuccessful. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to negotiate the curve properly and crossed into the opposing lane, resulting in the accident.
