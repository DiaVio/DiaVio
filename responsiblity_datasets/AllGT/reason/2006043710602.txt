The reason for V1's responsibility is that the vehicle departed the roadway to the right side and collided with a tree. The driver, a 23-year-old male, declined to be interviewed, but based on medical records and injury patterns, it is believed that he was driving the vehicle at the time of the crash. Additionally, the female passenger's statement that she has let her brother-in-law (the driver's brother-in-law) drive when she doesn't feel well indicates that the driver was likely responsible for the crash.
