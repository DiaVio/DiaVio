The reason for this is that V1, driven by the restrained 74-year-old male driver, drifted onto the right roadside and made contact with multiple trees. The driver attempted to slow down by applying the brakes, but the vehicle slid and ultimately collided with several trees, causing it to roll over and sustain disabling damage. The driver also sustained serious injuries as a result of the crash. Therefore, based on the sequence of events described, it can be concluded that the driver of V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
