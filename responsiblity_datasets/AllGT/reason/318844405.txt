The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at a signal-controlled intersection while Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Dodge Ram large pickup) was proceeding straight. Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the offset frontal impact. Additionally, the height mismatch between the two vehicles allowed Vehicle 2 to override Vehicle 1's front plane, causing further damage and rotation of Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 1's failure to yield and causing the collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
