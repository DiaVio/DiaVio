The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being intoxicated and consuming a significant amount of alcohol prior to driving. This impaired his ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle and execute the left turn maneuver safely. Additionally, the driver was on medications that interact poorly with alcohol, further compromising his ability to operate the vehicle safely. The driver's inexperience, as it was his first time driving this particular vehicle, also contributed to the poor decision-making and lack of control. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
