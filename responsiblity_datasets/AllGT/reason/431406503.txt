The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a medical episode, causing her to pass out while driving. As a result, V1 veered from the right side of the travel lane to the left and collided with the rear of Vehicle #2 (V2). V1 then proceeded to travel around V2 on its left before crossing back across the eastbound lanes and ultimately impacting a light pole. The driver's loss of consciousness and subsequent inability to control the vehicle directly led to the collision with V2 and the subsequent impact with the light pole. Therefore, V1 bears primary responsibility for the accident.
