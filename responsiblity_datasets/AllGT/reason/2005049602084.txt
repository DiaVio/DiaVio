The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn into the northbound lanes of traffic from a stop sign, crossing the third lane of southbound traffic. This action indicates a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle (V2). Despite claiming to have waited for about 3 minutes at the stop sign, the driver of V1 failed to accurately assess the speed of the approaching vehicle and made an unsafe left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 is described as an inexperienced driver who had just purchased the vehicle the day before the crash. Limited experience, impatience, and unfamiliarity with the vehicle may have contributed to the driver's misjudgment and decision to make the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed while attempting a left turn.
