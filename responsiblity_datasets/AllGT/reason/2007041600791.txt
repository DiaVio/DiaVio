The driver of V1 was speeding through the neighborhood, knocking down road closed barricades, and driving on a closed roadway under major construction. The driver also had a suspended license and had taken the vehicle without the owner's knowledge. Additionally, there were witness accounts of the driver smelling of alcohol and being unable to stand up properly. The presence of a red-plastic cup that smelled of beer in the vehicle further supports the suspicion of alcohol involvement. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was negligent and engaged in illegal and reckless behavior, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
