The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention and being inexperienced. He stated that he did not see a left turn signal on V2 (the Chevy Cavalier) and was unable to avoid the collision despite attempting to brake and steer slightly to the right. This indicates that V1's driver was not maintaining a safe following distance and was not fully aware of the traffic situation ahead, leading to the rear-end collision with V2.
