The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle from which the object, described as a large metal or plastic u-shaped object, came loose and flew out of the bed. This object then crashed into the windshield of V1, causing damage and rendering the vehicle inoperable. V2 is responsible for properly securing their cargo and ensuring that it does not pose a danger to other vehicles on the road. In this case, the cargo shift from V2's pickup bed resulted in the object becoming a hazard and causing the accident.
