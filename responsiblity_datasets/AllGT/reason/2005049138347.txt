The reason for this is that V1 proceeded across the path of V2 without the right of way. V1 was stopped southbound in the second lane, waiting to turn into a business parking lot. However, V1's view of oncoming traffic in lane one was blocked by traffic backed up in oncoming lane number two. Despite this obstruction, V1 proceeded to make the turn, which resulted in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and turn with an obstructed view makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
