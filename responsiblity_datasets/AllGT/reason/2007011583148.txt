The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made inappropriate evasive actions in response to a non-contact vehicle coming into her lane. Instead of maintaining control and staying in her lane, she steered left onto the shoulder, then right back into lane 3, and then left again. This series of steering maneuvers ultimately led to V1 losing control and colliding with the median wall. Additionally, the driver's use of cruise control in moderate to heavy traffic may have contributed to her inability to react quickly and effectively to the situation. The fact that the inside shoulder had a drop-off from the newly paved lanes may have also played a role in the driver's loss of control. Overall, V1's driver's actions and choices were the primary factors leading to the accident.
