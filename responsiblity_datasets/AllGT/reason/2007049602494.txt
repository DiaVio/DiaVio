The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 was distracted by talking on her cell phone, which was confirmed by two witnesses at the scene. The driver of V2 failed to stop prior to entering the intersection, even though the traffic lights were flashing red for all four directions. This distraction and failure to stop resulted in V2 colliding with the right side of V1, causing the accident.
