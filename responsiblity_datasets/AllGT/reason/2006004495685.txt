The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by checking the vehicle behind him in the rearview mirror, which caused him to not notice that V2 (the Nissan Sentra) had come to a stop in front of him. V1 failed to take any avoidance action and subsequently struck V2 in the rear. Although V2 was conversing with a passenger, this does not appear to be a contributing factor to the accident as V2 came to a stop in response to the car in front of him slowing down. V2 made no avoidance maneuver, indicating that he was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to react to the stopped vehicle in front of him make him primarily responsible for the accident.
