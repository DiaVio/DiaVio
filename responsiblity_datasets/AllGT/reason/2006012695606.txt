The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling eastbound and entered the intersection after the traffic signal for eastbound traffic had changed to red. - The driver of V1 was distracted by using a cell phone, as reported by a witness. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not notice the traffic signal change. - V1's actions can be considered an illegal maneuver by going through a red light. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal, distracted driving, inadequate surveillance, and illegal maneuver make them primarily responsible for the accident.
