The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 40-year old female driver, failed to make the intended right turn at the intersection and instead continued traveling east, crossing the north/south roadway and departing the east roadside edge. This indicates a failure to properly navigate the intersection and maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with the building wall.
