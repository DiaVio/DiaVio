The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound in lane two when V1 (the Mazda M6) was making a left turn from northbound lane 2 at the crossover to the driveway of the strip mall. V2 failed to avoid the collision with V1, even though V2 attempted to brake. This indicates that V2 was unable to maintain proper control of their vehicle and was unable to avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2's front end struck the right rear of V1, causing V1 to rotate in a clockwise direction and subsequently striking V3 (the Chevy Silverado). Therefore, V2's failure to avoid the collision and the subsequent chain of events leading to the impact with V3 make them primarily responsible for the crash.
