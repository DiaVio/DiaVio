The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection, admitting to running the red light. This indicates a clear violation of traffic laws and a failure to yield the right of way to V2, who had already stopped and proceeded into the intersection. V1's inadequate surveillance and illegal maneuver further support their responsibility for the accident.
