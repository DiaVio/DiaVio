The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2 (113 kmph compared to 56 kmph) in congested traffic conditions. Additionally, V1 made sudden lane changes to avoid a non-contact vehicle, which resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2. This indicates that V1 was driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, as stated in the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and inability to respond to the changing traffic conditions and unexpected actions of others make them primarily responsible for the accident.
