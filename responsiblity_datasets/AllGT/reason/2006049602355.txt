The reason for this is that V1 allowed the vehicle to run off the right side of the roadway, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, V1's sharp steering to the left and subsequent counter clockwise yaw suggests a loss of control and poor directional control on the part of the driver. The lack of evidence supporting a tire failure further supports the conclusion that V1's actions were the primary cause of the crash.
