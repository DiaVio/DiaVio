The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at an excessive speed, which prevented them from being able to stop in time to avoid colliding with V1. V2 admits to seeing V1 enter the roadway and attempted to brake and avoid the collision, but their excessive speed made it impossible for them to stop in time. Therefore, V2's failure to control their speed and respond to the unexpected actions of V1 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
