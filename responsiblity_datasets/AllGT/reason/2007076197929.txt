The driver of V1 stated that he came around a blind turn and saw V2 stopped in the lane. However, he was unable to stop in time and skidded into the back of V2. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event coded for V1 was that he was driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, specifically after coming around a blind curve and finding forward traffic stopped in the traffic lane. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash because he was driving at a speed that did not allow him to safely react to the situation ahead, resulting in the collision with V2 and subsequently pushing V2 into V3.
