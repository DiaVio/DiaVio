The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. In this case, V3 had stopped for a pedestrian crossing illegally, causing V2 to come to a quick stop. V1, coming around the corner shortly after, was unable to avoid the collision despite braking and swerving. This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed that did not allow enough time to react and avoid the stopped vehicles ahead.
