The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn at the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver reported that her view of traffic was obstructed by a transit bus that was loading and unloading passengers. However, she chose to proceed with the left turn when the bus began to move forward, without fully assessing the oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the 1988 Volvo 740) attempted to avoid the collision by slamming on the brakes, as indicated by the skid marks left on the road. This suggests that V2 had a reasonable expectation that V1 would not proceed with the left turn. However, due to the sudden appearance of V1 in front of him, V2 was unable to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident because she made a left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so, despite having an obstructed view of oncoming traffic.
