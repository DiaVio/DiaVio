The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was experiencing a physical impairment of the ability to act, specifically due to his history of epileptic seizures. The driver admitted to not taking his medication at the time of the crash and reported blacking out, indicating a seizure likely occurred. This physical impairment caused him to lose control of the vehicle and veer off the right edge of the roadway, leading to the subsequent chain of events resulting in the crash. Additionally, factors such as driver fatigue, due to long work hours and lack of sleep, and emotional stress from being late for work and working extended shifts, further contributed to the driver's impaired performance and decision-making.
