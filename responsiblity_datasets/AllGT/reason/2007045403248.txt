The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2 (the Honda Accord) and failed to maintain a safe distance. V1's driver admitted to not having enough time to stop when V2 suddenly stopped in front of her. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to anticipate the actions of the vehicle ahead. Additionally, V1's braking with lockup and skidding into the rear of V2 suggests a failure to control the vehicle properly. Therefore, V1's actions of following too closely and failing to stop in time make them primarily responsible for the accident.
