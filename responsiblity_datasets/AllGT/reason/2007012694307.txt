The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to not taking his medication for depression for 48 hours and stated that he was fatigued with only 4.5 hours of sleep. He also mentioned having family and employment problems. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped" with the critical reason being a driver-related error of "internal distraction." Witnesses reported that Vehicle 1 was traveling at a high speed, changed lanes multiple times, and almost hit another witness's car before the impact. Therefore, the combination of the driver's mental state, fatigue, distraction, and erratic driving behavior makes Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the accident.
