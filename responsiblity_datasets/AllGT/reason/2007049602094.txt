The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the roadway. This is evident from the critical per-crash event and critical reason codes, which indicate that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the curve. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and poor directional control further contribute to their responsibility. The vehicle's defective tires, with over-inflation, under-inflation, and extensive wear, are associated factors in the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with the driver for not adjusting their speed appropriately for the curve and failing to maintain control of the vehicle.
