The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1, which was coded as "driver related factor-inadequate surveillance". V1 stated that they did not see V2 when entering the intersection, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness of other vehicles on the road. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2001 GMC Yukon XL) assumed that V1 would yield the right-of-way, which was a contributing factor to the accident. However, V2's assumption does not absolve V1 of their responsibility to ensure it is safe to make a left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
