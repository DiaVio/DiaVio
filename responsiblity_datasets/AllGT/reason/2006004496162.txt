The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, an 87-year-old male, admitted to being distracted and experiencing a driver recognition error. He stated that he was focused on a family problem at the time of the accident, indicating a lack of attention to the road. Additionally, the driver mentioned having several ailments and not recalling what medications he was taking, which could have contributed to his ability to react appropriately to the situation. Furthermore, V1 was traveling at a speed between 33-48kmph (21-30mph) at the time of impact, which suggests that the driver failed to adjust their speed to the wet road conditions. This failure to maintain a safe speed and exercise caution in adverse weather conditions contributed to the collision with the back of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention, distraction, and failure to adjust speed for the wet road conditions.
