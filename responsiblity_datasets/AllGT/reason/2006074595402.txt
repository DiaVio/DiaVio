The driver of Vehicle one was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically Vehicle two (2005 Honda Accord). This indicates that the driver of Vehicle one did not properly check for approaching vehicles before making the left turn. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one stated that she did not see the other vehicle at all, which further suggests a lack of attention and awareness on her part. While the driver of Vehicle two was involved in an encroachment over the left lane line, it is important to note that Vehicle two was traveling in the correct lane and did not contribute to the cause of the crash. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
