The reason for this is that V2 struck V1 from behind while V1 was stopped in traffic. The driver of V2 stated that the car in front of him stopped short, but he was unable to brake in time to avoid the collision. This indicates driver inattention on the part of V2, as he failed to maintain a safe distance and react in a timely manner to the traffic conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he had been stopped for some time before being struck, suggesting that V2 had ample opportunity to notice the stopped traffic ahead.
