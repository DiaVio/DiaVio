The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2) before making a left turn onto the arterial road. This failure to properly observe the traffic resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, factors such as the driver being in a hurry due to running late for a parent-teacher conference and being on medication to treat depression may have contributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance. It is important to note that the Critical Reason for V2 (the driver of the 1993 Saturn SW2) was not coded, as the driver refused an interview. Therefore, V2's responsibility cannot be determined based on the given information.
