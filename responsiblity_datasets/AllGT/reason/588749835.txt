The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a U-turn from the west paved shoulder area of the roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic. As a result, Vehicle 2 (the 2007 Dodge Ram 3500 medium truck) collided with the left side of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to properly assess the traffic conditions and execute a safe U-turn maneuver, leading to the collision.
