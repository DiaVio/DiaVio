The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and collided with the back of V2 (the 1992 Acura Integra) which was slowing down for V3 (the 1998 Chevrolet 1500 pickup) that was making a right turn. V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and adjust their speed accordingly resulted in the collision.
