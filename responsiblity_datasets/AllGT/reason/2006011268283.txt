The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that the brakes did not work, which is a vehicle-related factor. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to properly maintain their vehicle, resulting in a loss of control. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, having only been driving for 6 months, and was unfamiliar with the road. These factors contribute to the driver's inability to handle the situation effectively. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2004 Volvo XC) had no time for avoidance maneuvers and was unable to see V1 due to site obstruction caused by shrubbery at the corner. Therefore, while V2 was involved in the accident, the primary responsibility lies with V1.
