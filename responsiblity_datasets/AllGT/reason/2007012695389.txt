The driver of V1 was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, with a BAC of .22. This impaired his ability to safely navigate the curve and resulted in him overcompensating when he departed the roadway. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the curve and had tires with little tread, further contributing to the loss of control. These driver-related factors clearly indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
