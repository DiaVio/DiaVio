The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, entering the path of V1 (the vehicle involved in the crash). V1 was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. V2's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and turning left in front of V1 caused V1 to take evasive action, resulting in V1 leaving the road and colliding with a light post. Since V2 was the one who made the improper left turn, they are considered primarily responsible for the crash.
