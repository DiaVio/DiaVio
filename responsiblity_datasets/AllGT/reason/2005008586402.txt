The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline and entered the right eastbound lane, causing the front of Vehicle 1 to collide with the front of Vehicle 2 (the 2003 Honda Civic). The critical precrash event was attributed to Vehicle 1 as panic/freezing, as stated by the driver to the police officer. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 mentioned that she confused the accelerator with the brake pedal, which further supports the responsibility of Vehicle 1 for the accident.
