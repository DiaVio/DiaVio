The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for this event was determined to be a driver-related factor: driving too fast for the conditions, specifically on a snow-covered roadway. It is mentioned that the driver lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with a sign. Therefore, the responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 due to their failure to adjust their speed to the snowy road conditions, leading to a loss of control and the subsequent crash.
