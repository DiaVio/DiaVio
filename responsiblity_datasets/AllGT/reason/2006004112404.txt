The reason for this is that V1 was driving on the shoulder, which is an illegal act, and passed the non-contact vehicle that had stopped at the intersection. V1 did not stay in their proper lane and failed to look ahead before passing on the right. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced with the vehicle, having only driven it a few times. These factors contributed to the collision with V2, who was making a left turn and did not expect a vehicle to be driving on the shoulder. V2 had the right-of-way as indicated by the non-contact vehicle stopping and waving for them to make the left turn. However, V1's illegal and unsafe actions ultimately led to the accident.
