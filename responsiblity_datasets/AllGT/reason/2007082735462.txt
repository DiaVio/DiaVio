The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that her brakes failed to stop the vehicle, and she attempted to use the parking brake instead. The reporting officer also noted that the brakes were obviously inoperable. This indicates that V1's vehicle had a mechanical issue that directly contributed to the collision. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Mini Cooper) was stopped at the intersection and was struck from behind by V1. V2 was not at fault as they were stationary and not traveling at a higher speed. V3 (the driver of the 2004 Toyota Solara) was not involved in the first harmful event and the critical reason for the critical event is not coded to this vehicle, so they are not responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure of their brakes, which led to the collision with V2.
