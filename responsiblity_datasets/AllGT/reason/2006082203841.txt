The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to stop for the red light at the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at exit signs and not paying attention to the traffic controls. Although the position of the sun may have made the traffic signal less obvious, other vehicles behind V1 were able to stop for the red light without any issues, indicating that it was visible. V1's failure to stop for the red light directly led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
