The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a driver-decision error by turning left at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic in lane two. The driver's view was obstructed by the vehicles stopped in lane one, and she failed to take proper avoidance actions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking on her handheld cell phone, which further contributed to the driver-decision error. The emotional distraction of thinking about financial concerns may have also played a role in the driver's lack of attention to the road. On the other hand, V2 was traveling within the speed limit and was unable to see V1 until it was right in front of her due to the stopped vehicles in lane one. V2 braked, but the collision still occurred. Therefore, V2's actions were a result of the encroachment by V1 and the sight line restriction caused by the congestion. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error, distracted driving, and failure to take proper precautions when turning left onto the four-lane road.
