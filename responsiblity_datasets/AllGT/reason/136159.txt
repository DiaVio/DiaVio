The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while operating the vehicle, causing V1 to drift off the right edge of the pavement. The driver's subsequent attempt to correct the course by steering to the left resulted in a counterclockwise yaw, leading to V1 crossing the centerline and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's drowsiness and loss of control over the vehicle directly contributed to the accident.
