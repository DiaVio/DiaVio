The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had a medical event, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle and accelerate through the intersection. This medical event led to V1 crossing over the four-lane, two-way street, impacting a raised curb median, and ultimately crashing into the embankment. The driver's loss of control due to a medical event indicates that V1 was the primary cause of the accident.
