The reason for this is that V2, which was northbound on a three-lane, two-way street, impacted the right side of V1 in the intersection. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was crossing straight through the intersection. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate and slide to the northeast corner of the intersection, resulting in severe injuries to the occupants of V1.
