The reason for this is that V2 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including speeding and making rapid and frequent lane changes. Witnesses reported that V2 was honking its horn and veering aggressively towards other vehicles, including V1. Additionally, V2 was illegally using the HOV lane reserved for car pools. These actions indicate a disregard for traffic laws and a lack of consideration for other drivers on the road. Therefore, V2's aggressive driving behavior and illegal lane usage contributed to the collision and make them primarily responsible for the accident.
