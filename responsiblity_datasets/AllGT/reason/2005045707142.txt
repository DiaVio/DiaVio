The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection and recognize the change in the traffic light. This recognition error led to Vehicle #1 crossing into the intersection when the light was red, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2. Additionally, Vehicle #1's driver was unfamiliar with the area and uncomfortable driving in cities, which may have contributed to the driver's failure to properly observe the traffic signal. On the other hand, Vehicle #2's driver was conversing with passengers about a family problem, which could be considered a contributing factor. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event of Vehicle #2 was not coded, so it cannot be determined if there were any additional factors that would shift the primary responsibility away from Vehicle #1.
