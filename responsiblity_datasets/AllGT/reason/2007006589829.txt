The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 veered right and contacted the rear of Vehicle 2 (2002 Lexus RX300), which was legally parked against the north-side curb edge. This initial impact caused Vehicle 2 to rotate clockwise and contact the left side of Vehicle 3 (1998 Ford Aerostar Van), which was also legally parked in front of Vehicle 2. Since Vehicle 1 was the one that veered off the road and initiated the collision with the parked vehicles, it can be considered primarily responsible for the crash. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 fled the scene, making it difficult to determine any associated factors or injuries.
