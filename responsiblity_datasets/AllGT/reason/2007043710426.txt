The driver of V1 admitted to going too fast to make the left turn at the intersection. She was unfamiliar with the roadway and made a poor decision to attempt the turn after she had nearly passed the road. Additionally, she had only been driving for 9 months and had limited experience in this vehicle. The driver's inexperience, combined with her poor decision-making and excessive speed, led to the vehicle running off the road and overturning. The under-inflated and worn tires also contributed to the loss of control.
