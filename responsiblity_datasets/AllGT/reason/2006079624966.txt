The reason for this is that V1's driver was incapacitated due to a drug overdose, specifically from consuming a bottle of Ambien, a bottle of Tylenol, and a bottle of aspirin. The driver stated that she had attempted to commit suicide at home and did not remember anything after getting into the car. This indicates that the driver was not in a fit state to operate the vehicle safely. As a result of the driver's incapacitation, V1 departed the roadway multiple times, first contacting the guardrail in a sideswipe motion, then impacting a reflector signpost, a wooden highway signpost, and finally breaking through a chain-link security fence before coming to rest in a field. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, and the critical reason for the event was attributed to the driver's non-performance due to passing out from the drug overdose. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's incapacitation and inability to safely operate the vehicle.
