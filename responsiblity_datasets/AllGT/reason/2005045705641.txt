The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 made a recognition error by not adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic before attempting to turn left. The driver mentioned that her view may have been obstructed by the steep grade of her intersecting road and the hill on the arterial road. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed before making a left turn. On the other hand, Vehicle 2 (the 1999 Toyota Avalon) also had a contributing factor to the crash, which was a false assumption of other road user's actions. The driver of Vehicle 2 stated that she saw Vehicle 1 but didn't think that it would pull out from the stop sign when it did. However, this does not absolve Vehicle 1 of their responsibility for not properly surveilling the oncoming traffic. In summary, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and decision to turn left without ensuring it was safe to do so.
