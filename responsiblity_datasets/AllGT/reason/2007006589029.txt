The reason for V1's responsibility is that it struck the left rear of V2 (2006 Freightliner Columbia) while traveling in lane three. V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, stopped," indicating that V2 was stationary at the time of the collision. V1's critical reason for the event was coded as "an unknown reason for the critical event" since the driver refused to be interviewed. Therefore, V1 is responsible for the accident due to its failure to maintain a safe distance and avoid colliding with the stationary vehicle in front (V2).
