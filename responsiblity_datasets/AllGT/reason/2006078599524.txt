The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn across the southbound lanes of traffic, and failed to see V1 approaching in the right turn lane. V2's view of V1 was obstructed by other traffic, but it is still the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to ensure that it is safe to proceed. V2 should have taken extra caution and ensured that there were no oncoming vehicles before making the left turn.
