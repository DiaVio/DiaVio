The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by her dog being under the brake pedal, which caused her to release the brake and enter the intersection without fully stopping. This distraction led to her failure to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2006 Pontiac Torrent) who was approaching the intersection.
