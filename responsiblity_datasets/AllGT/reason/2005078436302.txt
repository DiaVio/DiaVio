The driver of V-1 was traveling at a speed of 89 kph (56 MPH) in a 56 kph (35 MPH) speed limit zone, which indicates that they were exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, the driver attempted to change lanes without properly assessing the situation, resulting in a collision with another vehicle. This aggressive driving behavior, along with the driver's blood/alcohol content of .165%, suggests impaired judgment and a lack of responsible driving. Therefore, V-1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed, aggressive driving behavior, and impaired state.
