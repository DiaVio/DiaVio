The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the curve/turn at the intersection. This is evident from the police-reported travel speed of 72 kmph, which indicates that the driver was exceeding a reasonable and prudent speed for the road conditions. Additionally, the driver admitted to consuming several beers during the night, which suggests that alcohol impairment may have contributed to his inability to navigate the turn safely. Furthermore, the driver stated that he was not familiar with the roadway he was driving on at the time of the crash, indicating a lack of knowledge about the road's characteristics and potential hazards. This lack of familiarity, combined with excessive speed and possible alcohol impairment, likely led to the driver's inability to negotiate the turn properly, resulting in the vehicle rolling and ending up in the canal. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, possible alcohol impairment, and lack of familiarity with the roadway.
