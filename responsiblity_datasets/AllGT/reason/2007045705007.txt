The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 was backing out of the driveway without properly checking for oncoming traffic. The driver failed to look and did not use the convex mirror located on the scene for backup surveillance. Additionally, it was the driver's first time on the roadway, indicating a lack of familiarity with the road conditions. These factors, combined with the obstructed view caused by the shrubbery on the north side of the roadway, contributed to the driver's decision error in backing out of the driveway and ultimately causing the collision.
