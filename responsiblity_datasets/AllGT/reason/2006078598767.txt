The driver of V1 admitted that his shoe got caught between the gas pedal and the brake pedal just prior to the intersection, which caused him to steer to the right and then to the left to avoid a vehicle that was stopped in front of him for the red light. This internal distraction and the resulting actions of the driver of V1 led to the collision with V2 (the Toyota Camry) and subsequently caused V2 to collide with V3 (the Chevrolet Caprice).
