The reason for this is that V2, the Chevrolet van, was stopped and pulled over across a private residence driveway, parallel to the eastbound lane. The driver of V2 then decided to turn left into the private residence driveway without using her turn signal and without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This decision and lack of signaling and surveillance led to the collision with V1, the Ford Thunderbird, which was already traveling straight in the westbound lane. Therefore, V2's failure to signal, inadequate surveillance, and distraction while concentrating on the wagon for sale along the road contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
