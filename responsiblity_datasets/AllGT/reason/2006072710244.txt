The reason for this is that Vehicle two was making a left turn at the intersection, and the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection." This indicates that Vehicle two was in the process of making a left turn when the collision occurred. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one (the 2000 Oldsmobile Alero) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction-over left lane line." This suggests that Vehicle one was not at fault for the accident, as it was traveling in its designated lane when the collision happened. However, it is important to note that the lack of interview and vehicle inspection for the driver of Vehicle two may limit the complete understanding of the circumstances leading to the accident.
