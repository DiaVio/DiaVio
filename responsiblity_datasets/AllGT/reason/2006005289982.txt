The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street across path. This suggests that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection attempting a left turn. Additionally, the wet road conditions and constant rainfall were associated factors for both vehicles. However, V2's failure to yield to V1's right of way is the main reason for the collision.
