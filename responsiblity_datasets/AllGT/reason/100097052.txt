The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an improper lane change without noticing the presence of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1991 Ford Mustang, in the adjacent lane. This resulted in a collision between the front left of V2 and the right rear of V1, initiating the rollover sequence. Additionally, it was determined that the front right seat passenger of V1 was not wearing her seatbelt, which contributed to the severity of her injuries. However, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1 for making the improper lane change and failing to notice the presence of V2.
