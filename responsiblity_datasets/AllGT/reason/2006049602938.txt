The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes without properly assessing the speed of the vehicle in lane three. When the driver realized that the non-contact vehicle was close, she abruptly steered to the right, resulting in the loss of control and the subsequent collision with the jersey barrier. This indicates a driver-related factor of overcompensation and misjudgment of the velocity of the other vehicle.
