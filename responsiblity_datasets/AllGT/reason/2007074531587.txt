The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle that entered the intersection and made a left turn, failing to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including V1, before making the left turn, resulting in the collision.
