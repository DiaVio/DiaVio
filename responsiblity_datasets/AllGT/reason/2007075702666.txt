The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to hydroplaning caused by the wet roadway and standing water. The driver stated that he hit a water bank or something, which initiated the hydroplane. Despite the driver's claim of not speeding, the police reported travel speed of 72 kmph (below the posted speed limit) supports this. Additionally, the tires of V1 were inflated well above the recommended tire pressure, which may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle in the wet conditions.
