The driver of Vehicle 1 realized he was about to miss his exit and began changing lanes to the right without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane. This resulted in the right plane of Vehicle 1 impacting the left plane of Vehicle 2, causing Vehicle 2 to rotate and come to rest in the opposite direction. Vehicle 1 then crossed over two lanes to the left, traveling in front of the path of Vehicle 3, resulting in a collision between the rear plane of Vehicle 1 and the front of Vehicle 3. Both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 3 traveled off the left side of the road into the median, with Vehicle 3 impacting the cable guardrail. Therefore, the primary reason for the accident is the inadequate surveillance and lane change by the driver of Vehicle 1.
