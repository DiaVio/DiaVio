The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, with a BAC of 0.194, which is significantly above the legal limit. The passenger's statement confirms that both the driver and the passenger had been drinking alcohol for the past six hours, including while en route to the collision location. This impaired the driver's ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle, leading to V1 departing the left side of the roadway and colliding with the raised asphalt curb. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of 113 kmph for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling above the designated speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph). This further contributes to the driver's poor directional control and inability to navigate the interchange safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's impaired state, excessive speed, and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
