The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound in the first travel lane, intending to go straight through the intersection. However, V2 encroached over the left lane line, which resulted in the collision with V1 (the GMC Safari) that was turning left from the northbound second travel lane. V2's encroachment into the left lane of oncoming traffic caused the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
