The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the stop sign. Despite stopping for about 3 seconds, the driver did not see V2 approaching and proceeded into the intersection, resulting in a collision with V2. The witness driving behind V2 confirmed that V1 did not slow down for the stop sign. Additionally, contributing factors such as the driver's unfamiliarity with the road and the vehicle, as well as being stressed due to being late for work, further indicate that V1's actions were the primary cause of the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) attempted to avoid the collision by steering into the left lane and accelerating. However, V2 was still struck by V1, indicating that V2's actions were a reaction to V1's failure to yield at the stop sign. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield at the stop sign.
