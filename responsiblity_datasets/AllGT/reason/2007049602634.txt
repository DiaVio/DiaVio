The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which was confirmed by the critical reason coded as "driver related factor - driver sleeping, that is, actually asleep." The driver's lack of sleep, with only 3 hours of sleep prior to the crash instead of his usual 8 hours, likely contributed to his inability to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with a tree.
