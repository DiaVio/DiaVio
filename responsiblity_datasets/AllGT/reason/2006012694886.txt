The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the traffic signal and entered the intersection when it was not clear to do so. The driver of V1 stated that he thought the traffic light had turned green and released the brake, but he did not see V2 until he was hit on the left side. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by talking to his passenger and not focusing on the driving task, which was identified as a critical reason for the crash.
