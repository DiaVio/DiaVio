The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling too fast for the conditions. The crash occurred on an ice-covered roadway, and V1 stated that their tires locked up on the ice when they applied the brakes. This indicates that V1 was not adjusting their speed appropriately for the road conditions, which ultimately led to them being unable to stop in time and colliding with V2. While V2 (the driver of the 2005 Buick Park Avenue) was also involved in the crash, they were not assigned a critical reason for the critical event. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision and was simply a victim of being rear-ended by V1. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, while V2 is not assigned any fault in the collision.
