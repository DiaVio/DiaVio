The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a diabetic (hyperglycemic) blackout or seizure, or had a heart attack, which impaired her ability to act and control the vehicle. This is evident from the witness's observation of V1 with its right turn signal on, indicating an intention to make a right turn, but then departing the right side of the roadway. Additionally, the driver's high blood sugar level of 400 mg/dl, as measured by EMS at the scene, suggests a diabetic episode. The critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the roadway on the right side is directly attributed to the driver's physical impairment.
