The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption of the actions of the driver of V2 (the 2000 Dodge Durango). V1 stated that they believed V2 was going to exit right to another roadway, and therefore thought it was safe to cross the intersection. However, V2 did not exit right and instead continued through the intersection, resulting in the collision. Although V2 was unfamiliar with the specific vehicle they were driving, they had 11 years of experience driving this class of vehicle. Additionally, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle encroachment" from crossing the street across the path, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their false assumption of the actions of V2.
