The reason for this is that V1 initiated a left turn (eastbound) in front of V2 (the Chevrolet Lumina), causing the front of V2 to strike the right side of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, which is a common cause of accidents at intersections. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," suggesting that V1's left turn was a contributing factor to the crash. It is important to note that the Critical Reason for the Critical Event of V2 (the Chevrolet Lumina) was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn.
