The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they lost control of their vehicle on the rain-covered road while negotiating a curve. Despite being familiar with the roadway and having a vehicle in good working order, V1 was traveling at a speed between 72 and 80 kmph (45 - 50 mph), which exceeded the advisory speed for the curve. Additionally, V1 stated that they attempted to brake and steer right but were unsuccessful in regaining control of their vehicle. V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado) took appropriate actions by slowing down and steering towards the guardrail to avoid V1. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
