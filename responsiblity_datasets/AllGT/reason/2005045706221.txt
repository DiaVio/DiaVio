The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to being distracted by eating and not paying attention to the intersection. He failed to recognize the red stoplight and did not adequately surveil the road ahead. These factors led to Vehicle 1 crossing over the intersection and colliding with Vehicle 2 (the 1979 Ford F250) which had the right-of-way with a solid green light. Therefore, Vehicle 1's driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the crash.
