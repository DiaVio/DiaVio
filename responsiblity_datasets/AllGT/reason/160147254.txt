The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 experienced a syncope episode, causing them to lose consciousness and veer off the southbound roadway. This resulted in V1 crossing the grass median and entering the northbound roadway, ultimately colliding with V2 and V3. As the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle due to a medical condition, they bear the primary responsibility for the accident.
