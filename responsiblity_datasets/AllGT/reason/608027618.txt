The reason for this is that the case vehicle drifted over the center line, indicating that the driver of V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle. Additionally, the driver's attempt to regain control by steering right resulted in the case vehicle entering a clockwise rotation and sliding laterally down the middle of the roadway. This ultimately led to the collision with V2. While V2 attempted to avoid the collision by moving to the far right side of the roadway, the initial action of V1 drifting over the center line and losing control was the primary cause of the accident.
