The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One admitted to being distracted while driving, specifically by eating a sandwich. This distraction likely caused him to not see the vehicle stopped in front of him until the last minute, leading to him slamming on the brakes and losing control of his vehicle. Additionally, the wet road conditions may have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle One's internal distraction and failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle are the main factors that led to the crash.
