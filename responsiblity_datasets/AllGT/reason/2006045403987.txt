The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and stated that he saw the traffic stopped ahead but was unable to fully apply the brakes due to an ice scraper sliding forward and obstructing the pedal. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, resulting in the collision.
