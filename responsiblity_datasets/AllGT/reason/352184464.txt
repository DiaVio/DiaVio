The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, intending to continue traveling south. It is the responsibility of the driver making a left turn to yield to oncoming traffic. In this case, Vehicle 2 (the 2004 Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck) was approaching the intersection from the south in the right northbound travel lane, intending to cross through the intersection and continue traveling north. Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
