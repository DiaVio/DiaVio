The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, and V2 (the driver of the 2005 Saturn Ion) was traveling straight in the opposite direction. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there is no information available about the driver of V1, so it is not possible to determine any further factors that may have contributed to the accident.
