The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as indicated by the failed alcohol test conducted by the State Trooper. Additionally, the investigation of the interior of the vehicle revealed marijuana residue on the driver's seat. These factors suggest impaired judgment and impaired ability to control the vehicle, which ultimately led to the driver driving off the road and into the gorge. The driver's admission of feeling drowsy and pulling over to "throw up" further supports the conclusion that her impaired state contributed to the accident.
