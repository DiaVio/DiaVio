The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver of V2 stated that he saw V1 about to run the light and accelerated in avoidance. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the collision. Additionally, V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires extra caution and yielding to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
