The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle after the rear wheel dropped off the edge of the roadway. The driver's overcompensation while steering left caused the vehicle to reenter the roadway, cross the single lane, and strike the concrete barrier. Additionally, poor directional control and overcompensation were associated factors coded to the driver of V1. While the severe drop-off from the road edge to the median may have contributed to the difficulty in reentering the roadway, it is ultimately the driver's responsibility to maintain control of the vehicle and react appropriately to the road conditions.
