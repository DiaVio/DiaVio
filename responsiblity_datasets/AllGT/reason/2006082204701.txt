The driver of V1 was distracted and not looking forward until his passenger warned him of the impending impact. This distraction caused him to fail to notice V2 (the 2002 Peterbilt tractor pulling a refrigerated semi-trailer) ahead of him in the center two-way turn lane. When he finally looked forward, he slammed on the brakes and skidded into the rear wheels of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road.
