The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver exhibited inadequate surveillance, specifically failing to look far enough ahead. This failure to properly observe the road and anticipate the upcoming gore point led to V1 departing the roadway, losing control, and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, the driver's confusion and uncertainty about which lane to be in at the "Y" junction contributed to the poor directional control and panic/freezing, further exacerbating the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the road conditions and make appropriate decisions.
