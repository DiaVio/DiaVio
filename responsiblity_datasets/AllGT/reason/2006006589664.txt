The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was traveling at a high rate of speed and made a decision error by aggressively cutting in front of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Kenworth tractor with trailer). V1 attempted to enter lane two to avoid the parked cars in lane one, but misjudged the gap distance and speed of V2. This aggressive driving behavior and misjudgment led to the collision between V1 and V2, causing a chain reaction that involved V3 (the 1999 Honda CRV) and V4 (the 1994 Jeep Cherokee). V2, on the other hand, was traveling in lane two and had the right of way. He stated that he saw V1 cut in front of him and applied his brakes, but it was too late to avoid the collision. V2's possible distraction from conversing with his passenger may have contributed to the crash, but V1's aggressive driving and misjudgment were the primary factors. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the four-vehicle crash due to her aggressive driving behavior, speeding, and misjudgment of the gap distance and speed of V2.
