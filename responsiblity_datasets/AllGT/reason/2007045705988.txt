The reason for this is inadequate surveillance by the driver of V1. The driver claimed that a non-contact vehicle in lane 2 eastbound blocked her view of V2 (the 1996 Mazda Miata) and she did not see it until the impact. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe her surroundings and failed to see the approaching V2, resulting in the collision.
