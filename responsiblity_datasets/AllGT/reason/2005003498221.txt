The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was traveling in the wrong direction (eastbound in the westbound lane) and veered into the westbound lane, resulting in a collision with Vehicle #1 (the Ford F-150). Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 was reported to have an alcohol odor about him, suggesting possible impairment. The fact that the driver of Vehicle #2 fled the scene on foot further supports the belief that they were trying to evade being incarcerated, possibly due to driving under the influence. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #2 is considered primarily responsible for the crash.
