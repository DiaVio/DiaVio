The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that she made a decision error by illegally maneuvering through the intersection, believing she had the green light. This decision error led to her crossing the path of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there were associated factors such as her emotional state due to a horse training incident and the fact that she was taking multiple prescription medications, although these factors were not thought to have directly contributed to the crash.
