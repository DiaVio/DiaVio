The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, as stated by the driver herself during the interview. Additionally, the driver admitted to being upset and not thinking straight due to a family argument, which could have contributed to her inattention and inability to properly navigate the curve.
