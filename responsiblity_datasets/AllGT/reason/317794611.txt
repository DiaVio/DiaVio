The reason for this is that V1 drifted off the left roadside and entered the grassy median, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, V1 made contact with the guardrail end, causing it to break away, and subsequently collided with a fence and went airborne over a large ditch. These actions suggest a lack of proper attention and control while driving, leading to the accident.
