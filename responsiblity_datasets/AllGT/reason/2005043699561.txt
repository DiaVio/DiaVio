The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while swatting at a wasp that flew into the window. This internal distraction caused a recognition error, leading to the vehicle veering off the road and colliding with parked vehicles (V2, V3, and V4). Although the driver claims that a possible stroke occurred, there is no evidence to support this claim. The primary cause of the crash was the driver's distraction and loss of control due to swatting at the wasp.
