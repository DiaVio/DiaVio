The reason for this is that Vehicle One hit the back of Vehicle Two, indicating that Vehicle One failed to maintain a safe following distance and failed to stop in time to avoid a collision. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle One was not paying attention or was driving too fast for the conditions, as there were construction works and the lane was reduced to two lanes. Vehicle Two (1994 Toyota Camry) was stopped due to the construction work, and the driver had been stopped for a few seconds before getting hit. The driver of Vehicle Two was also actively monitoring the traffic behind her by looking in the rearview mirror. Therefore, it can be inferred that Vehicle Two was not at fault for the collision. Vehicle Three (1995 Mercury Villager) was also stopped due to the construction work, but there is no information available about the driver's actions or behavior. Therefore, it cannot be determined if Vehicle Three bears any responsibility for the crash. In summary, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and stop in time to avoid a collision.
