The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted an illegal maneuver by aggressively changing lanes and passing on the left shoulder, despite the fact that the desired exit lane was occupied. This illegal maneuver led to V1 impacting the traffic impact attenuator and subsequently colliding with V2 (1997 Mitsubishi Mirage).
