The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted internally. The driver admitted to looking down to re-buckle her seat belt, which caused her to drive off the roadway. This internal distraction led to V1 traveling off the right side of the road, crossing the left lane line, and ultimately rolling over.
