The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 suffered a seizure, causing V2 to depart its lane, travel onto the north shoulder, and then return towards the westbound lane. This erratic movement of V2 ultimately led to the collision with vehicle one (V1), the 2013 Subaru Impreza.
