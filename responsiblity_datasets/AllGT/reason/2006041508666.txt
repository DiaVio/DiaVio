The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to slow down and rear-ended V2 (the Infinity G20) despite V2 experiencing mechanical problems and rapidly decelerating. V1's driver stated that there was a vehicle stopped on the interstate in the driver's travel lane, but V1 did not recall if the other vehicle had hazard lights on. However, V1's driver mentioned that traffic in the lane to the left prohibited him from making a lane change, which led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance and adjust speed accordingly when encountering a vehicle with mechanical problems.
