The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that they saw V2's approach but assumed that V2 would slow down when the light turned yellow. However, instead of slowing down, V2 was accelerating. This false assumption led V1 to initiate the left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, is not primarily responsible for the collision. While V2 was driving above the posted speed limit and did not take any evasive action before the collision, the critical reason for the event was attributed to V1's false assumption, not any fault on the part of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their false assumption of V2's actions, which led to the collision.
