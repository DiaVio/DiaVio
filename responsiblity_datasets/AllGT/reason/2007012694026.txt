The driver of V1 attempted to pass a slower moving vehicle on a roadway covered with black ice. This indicates that the driver was not exercising caution and did not adjust their speed to the road conditions. The driver's decision to pass in these conditions led to a loss of control, resulting in the vehicle leaving the roadway, striking a signpost, and ultimately rolling over. Therefore, the driver's error of traveling too fast for the icy road conditions is the primary reason for the crash.
