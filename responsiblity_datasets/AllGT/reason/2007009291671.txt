The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of drugs, which impaired his ability to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver was fatigued, further compromising his ability to safely operate the vehicle. These factors, combined with the driver's inability to remember anything leading to the crash and the lack of evidence suggesting any avoidance maneuvers, indicate that V1's driver was at fault for the accident.
