The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a high speed and its front end penetrated the driver's seating area of V1 (1993 Toyota Corolla), causing severe injuries to the driver of V1. The intrusion of V2's front end into V1's driver's door window opening indicates a significant impact force from V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 did not conduct any avoidance maneuver prior to the collision, suggesting that V2's high-speed impact was unexpected and the driver of V1 had no opportunity to avoid the collision.
