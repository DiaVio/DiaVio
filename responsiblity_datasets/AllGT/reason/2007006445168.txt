The driver of V1 was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed, disregarded a red traffic light, and proceeded onto a one-way street in the wrong direction. Additionally, the driver was under the influence of drugs and alcohol, which impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. These driver-related factors, including aggressive driving and an illegal maneuver, directly contributed to the collision. The lack of a "do not enter" sign at the beginning of the roadway and the difficult-to-view "one-way" signs were roadway-related factors that may have contributed to the confusion, but ultimately, the driver's actions were the primary cause of the accident.
