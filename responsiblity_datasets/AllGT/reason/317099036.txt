The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the right westbound lane in front of a stopped vehicle and continued into the second westbound lane, directly into the path of V2 (the 2008 Ford Taurus X). This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
