The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was traveling on the right lane and made a decision error by driving too fast for the curve on the roadway. This resulted in the right/front tire and wheel contacting the raised curb on the right side of the travel lane, causing the tire to blow and the front of the vehicle to subsequently contact the guardrail. Although the roadway was wet and there was a slight drizzle, the driver's decision to drive too fast for the curve was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. The driver's statement that he was in good health and had adequate sleep suggests that there were no external factors contributing to the decision error. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
