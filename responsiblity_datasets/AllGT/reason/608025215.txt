The reason for this is that the case vehicle had a bald and worn right-rear tire, with the steel casing ply cords visible. This indicates a lack of proper maintenance and negligence on the part of the driver or owner of the vehicle. The loss of traction and subsequent departure from the roadway can be attributed to the poor condition of the tire, which compromised the vehicle's ability to maintain control while navigating the left-sweeping, banked curve with an upgrade.
