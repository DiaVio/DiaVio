The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it initiated the chain of events by changing lanes into lane 1 without ensuring it was clear, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2 (V2). This initial impact caused both vehicles to move to the left and make contact with each other and the concrete traffic barrier. V1 then climbed over the barrier and rolled over, eventually coming to rest in the southbound lanes. The subsequent collision with Vehicle 3 (V3) was a result of V1's continued forward motion after the rollover. V1 was forced into the southbound lane 1, where it was struck head-on by V3. This collision caused V3 to veer off the roadway and come to rest in a grassy ditch. While Vehicle 4 (V4) also had a minor collision with V1, it can be considered a secondary impact and not the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and V1's initial lane change without proper clearance, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
