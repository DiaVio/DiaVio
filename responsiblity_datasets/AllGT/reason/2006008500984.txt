The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while driving due to severe fatigue caused by a combination of factors. These factors include working long hours for three consecutive days, having a high-pressure job with multiple projects, getting only 4 hours of sleep per night, dealing with personal losses, and being in a hurry to get to her class. The driver's fatigue and falling asleep at the wheel led to V1 crossing into the eastbound lane and colliding with the parked Chevrolet truck.
