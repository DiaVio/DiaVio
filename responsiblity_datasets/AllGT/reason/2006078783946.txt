The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to pass V2 (the Chevrolet pickup) at a high speed of 96 kmph (60 mph), which was above the posted speed limit. V1 then steered back into the northbound lane to avoid a southbound vehicle, but failed to adequately surveil the road and did not see V2 in the lane. As a result, V1's right front corner struck the left side of V2, causing the accident. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to maintain control while attempting to pass another vehicle make them primarily responsible for the collision.
