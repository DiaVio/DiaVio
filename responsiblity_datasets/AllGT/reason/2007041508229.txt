The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher rate of speed and failed to adjust its speed as it approached the intersection. This is supported by the police-reported travel speed of 113 kmph (70 mph) for V1, which was significantly above the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The driver of V1 also admitted to aggressive driving, which further indicates a lack of caution and responsibility. Additionally, the driver of V1's statement conflicts with the physical evidence at the scene and the vehicle damage patterns. This suggests that the driver may not be providing an accurate account of the events leading up to the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 Ford Explorer) was driving at a lower steady speed and attempted to move out of the way when she noticed V1 rapidly overtaking her. The driver of V2 also mentioned that the other driver swerved at the last second, indicating that V1's actions were unexpected and contributed to the collision. Overall, V1's excessive speed, failure to adjust speed, and aggressive driving make them primarily responsible for the accident.
