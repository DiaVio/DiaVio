The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted into the southbound travel lane, causing the collision with Vehicle 2. The driver of Vehicle 2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, but was unable to prevent the impact. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 1 in drifting into the wrong lane led to the collision.
