The reason for this is that V1 misjudged the gap and the speed of the traffic in front of him, resulting in his brakes locking and colliding with the back of V2 (the 2003 Pontiac Montana). V1's statement that he was going about 72 kmph (45mph) at the time of the crash indicates that he was traveling at a higher speed than the congested traffic in the right lane. Additionally, V1 falsely assumed that the other driver would continue to proceed, which further contributed to the crash.
