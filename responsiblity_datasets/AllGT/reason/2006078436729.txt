The reason for V1's responsibility is that the tread separated from the right rear tire, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 veering into the median, rolling across it, and ultimately entering the eastbound lanes where it collided with V2 (2003 Cadillac Deville). The tire failure on V1's vehicle was identified as the critical pre-crash event, and the critical reason for this event was coded as a vehicle-related factor: tires/wheels failed.
