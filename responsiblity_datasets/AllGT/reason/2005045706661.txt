The driver of Vehicle 1 was making a left turn across eastbound traffic and failed to adequately surveil the intersection due to a sightline restriction caused by a non-contact vehicle stopped in the left eastbound lane. The driver turned with an obstructed view and did not see the approaching Vehicle 2 (2000 Oldsmobile Alero) encroaching over the left lane line. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 was talking with the passenger at the time of the crash, which may have further distracted her. While the driver of Vehicle 2 had a vision impairment and was not wearing her glasses, it is important to note that the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1.
