The driver of V1 assumed that V2 ran a red light, which led her to make a left turn without yielding the right-of-way. However, it was later observed that the left turn arrow would not illuminate for V1's direction of travel, indicating that V1 did not have a protected green arrow. This false assumption of other's actions by the driver of V1 resulted in the collision with V2 and subsequently with V3.
