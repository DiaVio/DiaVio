The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed of 64 kmph (40 mph), which is above the speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) for the road. - V1 was driving aggressively, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being assigned as aggressive driving behavior. - V1 had unsecured cargo in the vehicle, which shifted forward prior to the collision. This would have increased the stopping distance for the vehicle. - Skid marks prior to impact indicate that V1 had traveled partially into the center two-way turn lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. - V1 was unable to stop in time for the red light, indicating a failure to obey traffic signals. Therefore, V1's speeding, aggressive driving behavior, failure to maintain proper lane position, failure to obey traffic signals, and the presence of unsecured cargo all contribute to their primary responsibility for the collision.
