The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the investigating officer estimated V1's speed at impact to be 40kmph (25 mph), which is below the posted speed limit of 56kmph (35 mph). Additionally, V1 failed to stop for the traffic control device, indicating an illegal maneuver. There are no known associated factors coded to V1. On the other hand, V2 (the 1999 Dodge Durango sport utility) was traveling at the estimated speed of 56kmph (35 mph), which is within the posted speed limit. Although the driver of V2 was talking on a hands-free cell phone at the time of the crash, it is not a coded critical reason for the crash. The driver of V2 also refused to identify the names of the prescription medications she was using, which may have caused inattention, but this information is not sufficient to assign primary responsibility to V2.
