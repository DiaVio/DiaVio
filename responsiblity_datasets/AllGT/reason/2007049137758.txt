The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 admitted to being emotionally upset, in a hurry, and possibly fatigued. The driver was deep in thought and not paying attention to the road at the time of the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating that the driver veered into the median and struck the bridge support wall. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and lack of focus on the road.
