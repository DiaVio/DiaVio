The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others, specifically the stopped position of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or was not paying attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision with the back of Vehicle 2 and subsequently pushing it into Vehicle 3.
