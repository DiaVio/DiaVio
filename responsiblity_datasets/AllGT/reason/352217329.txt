The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the northbound travel lane while traveling south, causing a head-on collision with Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to steer left to avoid the collision but was unsuccessful. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, who entered the wrong lane, led to the accident.
