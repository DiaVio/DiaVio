The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's driver did not know the color of her traffic signal prior to the crash, which suggests a lack of attention and awareness. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2004 Mazda Tribute) had a green traffic signal and entered the intersection to make a left turn. The presence of a vehicle stopped in the westbound lane one obstructed V2's sightline, which was an associated factor in the crash. However, V2's actions were in accordance with the traffic signal, and the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the intersection and yielding to oncoming traffic.
