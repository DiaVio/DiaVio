The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection without the right of way. V2 (the 1999 Ford Expedition) was approaching the intersection in the second travel lane, which means they had the right of way. V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and turning left without the right of way resulted in the collision.
