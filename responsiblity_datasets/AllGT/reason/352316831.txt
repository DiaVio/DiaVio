The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the left, northbound through lane and intended to continue traveling straight. Vehicle 2 (the 2003 Honda Odyssey minivan) was in the left southbound turn lane, intending to turn left and access the eastbound travel ramp. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 in an off-set configuration. Since Vehicle 1 was traveling straight and had the right of way, it can be inferred that Vehicle 2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
