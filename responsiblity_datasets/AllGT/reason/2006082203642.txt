The reason for this is that the driver of V1, a fourteen-year-old male, was not licensed to drive and was operating the vehicle without proper authorization. Additionally, the driver stated that he blacked out before the crash, which is confirmed by medical reports. This indicates a physical impairment that affected his ability to act and control the vehicle. The driver's fatigue and inexperience also contributed to the crash.
