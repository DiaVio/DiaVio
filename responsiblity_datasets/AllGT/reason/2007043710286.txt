The reason for VI's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and overcompensated while attempting to switch lanes. This resulted in a series of overcorrections, causing the vehicle to leave its travel lane, rotate clockwise, and ultimately rollover. The driver's panic and overcompensation were the critical reasons for the crash. Additionally, the driver's failure to check traffic to the left front and left side before changing lanes contributed to the accident. The driver's health condition, being a gestational diabetic, may have also played a role in her ability to react appropriately in the situation.
