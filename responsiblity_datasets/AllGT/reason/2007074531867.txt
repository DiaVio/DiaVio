The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that turned left at the intersection and traveled off the right side of the road. The driver of V1 then put the vehicle into reverse and moved backward into the road and then off the left side of the east/west road, ultimately striking a post and two trees. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side," and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." Additionally, the driver of V1, an eighty-year-old male, has physical limitations due to a stroke three years previously, which was identified as an associated factor in this crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's poor directional control and the vehicle's movements off the road.
