The driver of V1 made a recognition error and was internally distracted due to an argument with the passenger. This caused her to lose focus on the driving task and resulted in the vehicle reversing directions and attempting to turn right instead of left. Additionally, the driver's fatigue from not having slept for 26 hours and the use of multiple muscle relaxants further impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. Inexperience with the borrowed vehicle and unfamiliarity with the road may have also contributed to the crash.
