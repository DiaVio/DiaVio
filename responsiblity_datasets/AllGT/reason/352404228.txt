The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the closed, left northbound travel lane at a cross-over area, which was intended for parked vehicles only. Despite seeing the parked Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Peterbilt 379 series heavy/medium truck), the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to avoid a collision and struck the back plane of Vehicle 2 in a front left narrow corner engagement with under ride. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to exercise caution and yield to the parked vehicle, resulting in the collision.
