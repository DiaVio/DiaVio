V1 was traveling at a speed of 56 to 64 KPH (35 to 40 MPH) in a 32 KPH (20 MPH) zone, which indicates that V1 was exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, V1 was not wearing glasses or contact lenses, which were required for the driver. These factors contributed to V1 being unable to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contacted vehicle backing into the roadway. V1's swerving movements to avoid the non-contacted vehicle and the parked vehicles on the left side of the roadway ultimately led to the collision with Vehicle two (V2).
