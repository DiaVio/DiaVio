The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 misjudged both the distance and velocity of the approaching trolley. Despite noticing that her traffic light was not lit, the driver of V1 proceeded through the intersection without properly assessing the situation. She believed she had plenty of time to proceed, but failed to accurately gauge the speed and distance of the oncoming trolley. This misjudgment led to the collision with the trolley. Additionally, the malfunctioning traffic signal was also coded as an associated factor. While the malfunctioning signal may have contributed to the confusion at the intersection, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for not exercising caution and misjudging the approaching trolley.
