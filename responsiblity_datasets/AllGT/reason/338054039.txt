The driver of Vehicle 2 allowed the vehicle to partially depart the right north pavement edge onto the grass shoulder, and then attempted to re-enter the road by steering left and braking. This maneuver caused Vehicle 2 to rotate counterclockwise and cross into the path of Vehicle 1 (the 2006 Chevrolet Equinox). The collision occurred when the front right area of Vehicle 2 impacted the frontal area of Vehicle 1. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2's actions of leaving the road and attempting to re-enter without proper control led to the collision, making Vehicle 2 primarily responsible for the accident.
