The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize that the delivery truck ahead was stopped. This failure to recognize the stopped vehicle was due to a false assumption of the truck's actions. The driver of V1 saw the truck from a reasonable distance but did not realize it was stationary. This false assumption led to the driver continuing to travel in the right lane and closing the gap between the two vehicles. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes to the left when she realized the truck was stopped, but there was a red car occupying that lane. Despite the red car traveling faster, the driver of V1 still attempted to steer left, resulting in the collision with the back left corner of the delivery truck. Other factors contributing to V1's responsibility include the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway, external distractions from searching for a turn destination, and insufficient braking inputs. It is believed that if the driver of V1 had used both braking and steering inputs, rather than just steering inputs, the crash could have been avoided or its severity reduced. In summary, V1 (the Pontiac Vibe) is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to recognize the stopped delivery truck, false assumption of the truck's actions, and inadequate response to the situation.
