The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and struck the right side of V2. V1's movement was coded as going straight, indicating that it was traveling through the intersection. The driver of V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, suggesting that they did not properly observe the traffic signal or other vehicles before entering the intersection. Additionally, V1's rotation and final resting position off the roadway on the northwest corner further indicate that V1 was the one who initiated the collision.
