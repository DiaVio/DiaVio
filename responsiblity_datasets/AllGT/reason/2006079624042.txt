The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the traffic ahead and did not look far enough ahead as she merged into lane one. This resulted in V1's front plane contacting the rear plane of V2, initiating the collision. V1's failure to detect V2, which was stopped in time to avoid the crash, indicates a lack of proper surveillance and attention on the part of the driver.
