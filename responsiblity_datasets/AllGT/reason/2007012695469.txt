The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related error by turning with an obstructed view. Despite not being able to see if it was clear, the driver proceeded because other drivers were waving her on. This decision to proceed without ensuring a clear path contributed to the collision with V2. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the stopped vehicles in the westbound lanes further hindered V1's ability to see oncoming traffic, but it does not absolve the driver of the responsibility to ensure a safe turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error in turning with an obstructed view.
