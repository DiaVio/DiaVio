The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn across the northbound traffic lanes. V1 stated that she did not see V2 (the Honda Odyssey) approaching in lane 2, indicating a failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1 was driving with one hand while holding a cell phone, even though it was not in use, which could have distracted her attention from the road. While V2 may have been slightly over the posted speed limit, this alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2 stated that she saw V1 starting to pull out and attempted to brake and steer left to avoid the collision, indicating that she took appropriate evasive action. Overall, V1's failure to properly survey the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
