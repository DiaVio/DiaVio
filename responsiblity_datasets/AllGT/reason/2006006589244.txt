The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a U-turn without adequately surveilling the roadway. V2 misjudged the velocity of V1 and thought that V1 was completely stopped, leading to the collision. Additionally, V2 was an inexperienced driver who was unfamiliar with the roadway, further contributing to the inadequate surveillance and misjudgment of the situation.
