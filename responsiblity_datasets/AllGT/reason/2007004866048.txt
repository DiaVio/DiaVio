V1 was attempting to turn left at the intersection and failed to adequately survey the oncoming traffic before making the turn. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 was an inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to the lack of proper judgment in assessing the oncoming traffic. The weather conditions of rain and cloudy skies may have also affected visibility, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not ensuring a safe turn.
