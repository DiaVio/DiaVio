The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and failed to stop at the stop sign, running through the intersection. V2 also had inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to look far enough ahead to either side while approaching the intersection. These actions directly contributed to the collision with V1, which was already stopped at the stop sign heading northbound.
