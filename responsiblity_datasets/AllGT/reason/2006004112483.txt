The driver of V1 ran a red light and entered the intersection without stopping. This illegal maneuver caused the collision with V2 (the Chrysler Concorde), which had the right of way as it was traveling on a green light. The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 until the impact, indicating inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed to have a yellow light when entering the intersection, but this contradicts the witness statement from the driver behind V2, who confirmed that they had a green light. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light, inadequate surveillance, and disregarding the traffic control device.
