The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, which indicates a failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. As a result, the front of Vehicle Two (V2), the 2003 Dodge Durango, contacted the left side of V1, leading to the collision.
