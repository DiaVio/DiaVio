The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and lost control of the vehicle. The driver admitted to traveling over the speed limit and not being able to regain control when the vehicle began to fish-tail. Instead of using a combination of braking and steering inputs to regain control, the driver only applied the brakes, which was an incorrect evasive action. Additionally, the driver was an inexperienced driver with less than a year of driving experience.
