The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the statement provided by the driver of V1, who mentioned that she did not see V2 until the impact. The critical reason for the critical event of V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver of V1 failed to look or looked but did not see V2 approaching. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2002 KIA Optima) attempted to avoid the collision by steering left but was unable to do so effectively.

In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while making a left turn at the intersection.
