The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle (V1) while it was making a left turn through the intersection. V2 was westbound in the left-turn lane and should have yielded to V1, which was already in the intersection. Therefore, V2 failed to yield the right of way, resulting in the collision.
