The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a decision error by falsely assuming the actions of other road users. The driver of V1 forgot that eastbound traffic does not stop at the intersection, leading to the driver pulling out in front of V2. This decision error directly contributed to the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, the associated factors of personal concerns and not thinking about them at the time of the crash, as well as engaging in recreational activities prior to the crash, suggest that the driver of V1 may have been distracted or not fully focused on the road. Therefore, based on the driver's decision error and associated factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
