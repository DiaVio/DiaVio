The reason for this is that V1 disregarded the stop sign and entered the intersection without stopping. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2, misjudging their velocity and gap distance before proceeding into the intersection. This combination of actions by the driver of V1 led to the collision with V2.
