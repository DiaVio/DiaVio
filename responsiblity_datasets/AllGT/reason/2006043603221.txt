The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn across the southbound lanes, but misjudged the speed and distance of V2 (the Nissan Sentra). V1 accelerated across the lanes but could not avoid being struck by V2. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, factors such as inattention, conversation with a passenger, and driver inexperience contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
