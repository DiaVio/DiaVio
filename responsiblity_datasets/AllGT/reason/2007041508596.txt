The driver of V1 failed to maintain control of her vehicle on the wet roadway and was traveling too fast for the conditions. She did not slow down when encountering slippery road conditions, which led to the loss of control. Additionally, the driver was distracted by having a social conversation with her passenger at the time of the crash. These factors, combined with the presence of wet roads and heavy rain, contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle and ultimately caused the accident.
