The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 took evasive action to avoid the taxi, which resulted in losing control of the vehicle. The driver's overcompensation in steering, along with the vehicle-related tire deficiency (measured tread depth of one millimeter on three of the four tires), contributed to V1 fishtailing and veering off the right side of the interstate. This ultimately led to V1 reentering the roadway and colliding with V2. V2 (the Chevrolet Aveo) was not involved in the first harmful event and the driver's actions were a response to the out of control vehicle crossing in front of him. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
