Reason: 1. The driver of V1 was fatigued, having slept for only 18 to 20 hours in the last day, which could have impaired their ability to drive safely. 2. The driver had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .323, indicating that they were driving under the influence of alcohol, which significantly impairs judgment, coordination, and reaction time. 3. The driver had previously damaged their vehicle twice in the past two days, indicating a pattern of reckless driving or lack of attention to road safety. 4. The driver was talking on a handheld cell phone while driving, which is a distraction and diverts attention from the road. 5. The driver was driving with one eye closed due to a lost contact lens, which further impaired their vision and ability to perceive and react to hazards on the road. These factors, including fatigue, alcohol impairment, previous vehicle damage, distracted driving, and impaired vision, all contribute to the driver's responsibility for the crash.
