The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This suggests that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision. Since V2 was southbound in lane two and V1 was westbound in lane one, V2 should have yielded to V1 as it crossed the intersection. However, it is important to note that V1 (the van) left the scene prior to police arrival, so there is no further information available about the vehicle or driver. Therefore, the responsibility for the accident falls primarily on V2 due to their failure to yield.
