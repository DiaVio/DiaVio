The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is a potentially risky maneuver. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," indicating that V1 was in the process of making a left turn when the collision occurred. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that there was some form of driver error on the part of the driver of V1, although the specific details of the error are not provided. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser) was traveling straight in their lane and was encroached upon by V1, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event for V2 being coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their left turn maneuver and the presence of a driver-related error.
