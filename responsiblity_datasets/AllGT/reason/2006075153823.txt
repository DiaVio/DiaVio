The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that V1 was following a non-contact vehicle and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the collision with the back of V2 (the 1999 Toyota Camry). V1's driver did not provide much information about the crash, but the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to notice that V2 was stopped and did not react in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 56 kmph (35 mph), suggesting that V1 was not traveling at a significantly higher speed than V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not maintaining a safe following distance and failing to react to the stopped vehicle in front. In contrast, V2 was stopped at the intersection, waiting for the traffic signal to turn green, and was hit from behind by V1. While V2's driver reported being fatigued, there is no evidence to suggest that V2's actions contributed to the crash.
