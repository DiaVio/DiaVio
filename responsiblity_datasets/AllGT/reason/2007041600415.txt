The reason for this is that V1 initiated the lane change from lane two to lane three without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in a collision with V2 (the Honda Accord) in lane three. Additionally, V1 fled the scene of the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability. V2, on the other hand, was driving within the speed limit and in their designated lane. They attempted to steer to the left to avoid the collision, but unfortunately, this resulted in their vehicle spinning and ultimately hitting the left concrete wall. However, V2's actions can be considered an incorrect evasive maneuver, which was a contributing factor to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their unsafe lane change and hit-and-run behavior, while V2's actions can be seen as a secondary factor in the sequence of events.
