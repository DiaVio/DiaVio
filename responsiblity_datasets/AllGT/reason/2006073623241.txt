The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving too fast for the conditions. The driver admitted to driving over the speed limit during heavy rain with water collecting on the roadway. Additionally, the tires of V1 were under-inflated, which would have increased the risk of hydroplaning. This combination of factors - excessive speed and poor tire conditions - contributed to the loss of control of V1 and the subsequent collision with V2 (the illegally parked Jeep Cherokee).
