The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking for his cell phone and failed to notice that traffic had stopped ahead. This distraction caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2 (1998 Jeep Cherokee), which then caused a chain reaction involving V3 (2000 Toyota Corolla) and V4 (1994 Mercury Sable). Therefore, V1's driver-related factor of internal distraction directly led to the collision.
