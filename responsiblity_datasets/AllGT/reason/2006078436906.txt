The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver took incorrect evasive action when another vehicle appeared to be coming into her lane. Instead of properly reacting to the situation, the driver steered to the right, causing the vehicle to skid and ultimately roll over multiple times. Additionally, the driver's statement that the right front passenger was sleeping prior to the crash suggests that the driver may have been fatigued, which could have impaired her judgment and reaction time. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and potential fatigue.
