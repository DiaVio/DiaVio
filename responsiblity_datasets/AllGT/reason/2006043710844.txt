The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2, which then pushed V2 forward into the back of V3. V1's failure to stop indicates a lack of attention or awareness of the stopped vehicles ahead, which resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was charged with driving under the influence of an intoxicating substance, which further suggests impairment and potential negligence on their part.
