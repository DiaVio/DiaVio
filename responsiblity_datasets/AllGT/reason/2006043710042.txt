The reason for this is that V2 made an unsafe lane change from the northbound left-turn lane into southbound lane 2 without properly checking for oncoming traffic. V2 admitted to not seeing V1 coming and claimed that V1 must have been in his blind spot. Additionally, V2 was fatigued at the time of the accident, having only gotten 3.25 hours of sleep the night before, and had admitted to using Xanax, a tranquilizer that causes sedation and drowsiness, for personal enjoyment the day before the crash. These factors likely impaired V2's ability to properly assess the traffic situation and make a safe lane change.
