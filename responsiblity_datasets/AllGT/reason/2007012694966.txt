The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he changed lanes to avoid vehicles swerving on the bridge, but then his vehicle started to rotate clockwise. He counter steered and braked, but ultimately lost control and crossed the center line, colliding with Vehicle #2 (the 1996 Ford Explorer). The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as a vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, with the Critical Reason being the slick road surface caused by black ice. The driver of Vehicle #1 was also associated with factors such as the presence of swerving vehicles ahead and his own speed. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was not found to have any critical reason or associated factors that contributed to the crash. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he was decelerating and could do nothing to avoid the collision when Vehicle #1 crossed into his lane. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control on the icy road surface.
