The reason for V1's responsibility is that they were making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Dodge sedan) who was proceeding straight through the intersection. V1's false assumption of other actions led to the collision. Additionally, there were no known associated factors that could be coded to V1, as an interview could not be obtained. On the other hand, V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit, had the right of way, and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and swerving left. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute to their responsibility for the accident.
