The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 changed lanes abruptly and came to a stop in the travel lane directly in front of Vehicle 1 (the 2005 Nissan Altima 4-door sedan). Vehicle 1 was unable to avoid a collision and struck the rear of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 2's actions of changing lanes and stopping suddenly contributed to the collision.
