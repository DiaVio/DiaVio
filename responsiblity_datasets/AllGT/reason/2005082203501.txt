The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2 (the Ford Windstar). The driver of V1 stated that a soda bottle had rolled under his foot, which prevented him from applying the brakes in a timely fashion. However, a witness driving behind V1 saw the brake lights of V1 light up just before the impact, indicating that the driver was able to brake at the last second. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and stop in time, despite being aware of the stopped vehicle in front, makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
