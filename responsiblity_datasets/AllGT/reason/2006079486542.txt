The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.221, which is well above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. Additionally, the driver reported feeling fatigued and had less-than-normal sleep the night before the crash. These factors, combined with the driver's lack of formal driver training and only five months of driving experience, indicate a poor decision-making and control of the vehicle. The critical precrash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, which was caused by the driver's poor directional control. This driver-related performance error, resulting from a combination of fatigue, inexperience, and alcohol consumption, led to the collision with the guardrail and subsequent rolling of the vehicle.
