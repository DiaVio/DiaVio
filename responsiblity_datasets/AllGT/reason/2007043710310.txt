The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The authorized speed limit was 105 kmph (65 mph), but the roadway was wet due to a heavy rainstorm. The driver reported hitting a "water hole" in the roadway, which caused the vehicle to hydroplane and lose control. Despite knowing that hitting the brakes was a bad idea, the driver panicked and applied the brakes, further exacerbating the loss of control. Additionally, the rear tires of V1 had inadequate tread depth, which could have contributed to the loss of control on the wet road. Overall, V1's driver failed to adjust their speed to the wet conditions, took inappropriate evasive action, and had inadequate tire conditions, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
