The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was asleep at the wheel due to fatigue. The driver had been awake for 48 hours and was commuting from work to his mother's house. This level of fatigue significantly impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely, leading to the collision with V2.
