The reason for this is that V2, the unknown large Chevrolet utility van, failed to stop at the stop sign while traveling westbound. V1, the 2001 GMC Yukon Denali, had the right of way as it was traveling northbound and V2 entered the intersection from V1's right side. V1 driver stated that she saw V2 approaching the intersection but assumed that V2 would stop as required. When V2 did not stop, V1 driver applied the brakes but was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2 driver's refusal to cooperate with the investigation, including refusing to allow his vehicle to be inspected and leaving the scene, further suggests negligence on his part. The critical reason for V2's actions was determined to be inadequate surveillance, indicating that V2 driver failed to look or looked but did not see V1 approaching the intersection. Therefore, based on the available information, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance.
