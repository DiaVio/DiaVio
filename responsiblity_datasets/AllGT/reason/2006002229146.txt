The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking to her right to see if she could get back into the curb lane after passing slower traffic. This external distraction caused a recognition error, leading to the driver not seeing the deer crossing the highway. As a result, the vehicle collided with the deer, causing damage and coming to a rest on the median.
