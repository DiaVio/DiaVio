The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the case occupant was the driver of V1 and was not restrained by an available 3-point lap/shoulder belt. This lack of restraint contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the case occupant during the left side impact with a tree. Additionally, the case occupant's injuries indicate that he made contact with various components of V1, such as the A-pillar, steering wheel rim, door panel, and knee bolster, suggesting that he was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and was thrown around within the driver's seating area. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 (the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro) and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
