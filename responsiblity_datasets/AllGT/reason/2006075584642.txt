The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which resulted in the vehicle running off the road and colliding with the guardrail and cement barrier. The driver's fatigue, caused by working long hours and not getting enough sleep, contributed to the critical non-performance factor of sleeping while driving. This driver-related error led to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
