The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at an intersection, which was the critical pre-crash event for V2. The critical reason for this event was attributed to V2 and coded as inadequate surveillance. This means that V2 failed to adequately observe and assess the traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, the driver of V2 may have been distracted or inattentive due to his upcoming appointment with his parole officer. On the other hand, V1 was traveling in the first lane and did not have any critical reasons or events attributed to them. Therefore, V1 cannot be held primarily responsible for the collision.
