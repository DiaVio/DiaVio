The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without adequately surveilling for approaching vehicles. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance and decision error of failing to stop for the traffic control device led to the collision with V2. Although V2 was traveling at the appropriate speed and had the right of way, V1's failure to stop and yield resulted in the collision.
