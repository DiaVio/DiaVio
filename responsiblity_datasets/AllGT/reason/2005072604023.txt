The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: other vehicle stopped", and the critical reason for this event was attributed to Vehicle One being "too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others (specified as: Driver was going too fast for the congested conditions)". This indicates that Vehicle One was traveling at a speed that did not allow enough time to react to the stopped Vehicle Two ahead, resulting in the collision.
