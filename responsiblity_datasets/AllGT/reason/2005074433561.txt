The driver attempted an avoidance action when eastbound traffic apparently came to a stop, but the brakes failed, leading to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver should have adjusted their speed and gap due to heavy traffic conditions and the negative slope on the roadway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to decision error and the knowledge of a deficient braking system.
