The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road before turning left onto the highway. The driver stated that she intended to turn left out of the driveway but did not see V2 approaching. This indicates that V1 driver did not properly check for oncoming traffic before entering the highway, resulting in the collision with V2.
