The reason for this is that the driver of V2 steered left in an attempt to enter lane two of the eastbound lanes, causing the left rear of V2 to contact the right front of V3. This initial impact caused the driver of V2 to lose control and cross the center lane line into the westbound lane, resulting in the collision with V1. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V2 initiated the chain of events that led to the accident.
