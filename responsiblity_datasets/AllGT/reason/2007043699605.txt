The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance (failed to look). The driver of V1 stated that she never saw V2 (the 2007 Toyota Camry) before the impact, indicating a failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming traffic. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 colliding with V2 while attempting to make a left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately survey the intersection and observe the oncoming vehicle (V2) is the primary reason for the accident.
