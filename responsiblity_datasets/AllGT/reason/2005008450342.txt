The reason for Vehicle 1's responsibility is that it was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (10+ miles per hour over the speed limit) on a wet road surface due to rain. This excessive speed for the conditions, combined with the wet road, led to Vehicle 1 departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a utility pole.
