The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to pass another vehicle while it was slowing down to turn left. This maneuver, combined with over-steering and overcompensation, caused V1 to lose control and veer off the road, ultimately resulting in the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver had been consuming alcohol further contributes to their responsibility for the accident.
