The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Ford Taurus). Additionally, V1 was distracted by the sun glare and looking for his sunglasses inside the vehicle, which contributed to his failure to stop and caused the collision with V2.
