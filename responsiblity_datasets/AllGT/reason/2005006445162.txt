The driver of V1 stated that a vehicle in lane three tried to encroach into her lane, and after two attempts, it successfully entered her lane, forcing her to abruptly change lanes to lane one. While attempting to regain control, V1 lost control of the vehicle, struck the curb, and rolled over multiple times before coming to rest on its roof. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "This vehicle loss of control due to other cause of control loss," specifically an avoidance maneuver. This was chosen because a witness verified the presence and actions of the no-contact vehicle that cut off V1. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as overcompensation, a performance error. V1's abrupt lane change and subsequent loss of control can be attributed to overcompensating for the encroaching vehicle in lane three. Additionally, factors associated with V1 include experience-related factors such as avoiding the highway due to traffic and the use of a prescription allergy medication. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the overcompensation and loss of control resulting from the avoidance maneuver.
