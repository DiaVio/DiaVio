The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them and was unable to respond to the sudden stop in traffic caused by the fallen chair. Additionally, V1's view of the chair was obstructed, indicating a lack of attentiveness to the road conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and lack of attentiveness make them primarily responsible for the collision.
