The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which means it had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V2, the 2008 Volvo S60, was traveling straight in the southbound lane and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield and collided with the front of V2, causing the accident.
