The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) on an icy roadway with blowing snow, which was too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and crossed the double yellow line, resulting in a collision with V2. The driver of V2 (the Chevrolet Cavalier) was traveling at a slower speed of 18-32 kmph (11-20 mph) due to the bad weather conditions. The driver of V2 attempted to steer right to avoid V1, but was unable to do so. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed for the conditions and loss of control, resulting in the collision with V2.
