The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway twice, first onto a grass-covered shoulder on the right and then onto a grass-covered shoulder on the left. This indicates a loss of control by the driver, resulting in the vehicle leaving the designated roadway and ultimately colliding with trees. The driver's inability to exit the vehicle due to the jammed driver's door suggests that the impact forces were significant, further supporting the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
