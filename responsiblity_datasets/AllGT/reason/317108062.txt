The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, crossing over the eastbound lanes of the divided highway. V2 (the 1995 GMC Sierra) was traveling in the right lane of the eastbound lanes and swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid a collision with V1. However, V1's left front quarter panel was impacted by the front of V2, causing V1 to rotate and sideslap with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly execute the left turn at the intersection resulted in the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
