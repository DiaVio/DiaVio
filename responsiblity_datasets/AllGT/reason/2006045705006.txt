The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the right side of the road at the beginning of the curve, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the low tire tread on V1's front tires could have contributed to poor traction and reduced control, further supporting V1's responsibility for the crash.
