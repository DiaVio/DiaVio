The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic while merging onto the roadway. This resulted in Vehicle #1 riding on top of the guardrail and coming to rest facing west. The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by watching oncoming traffic while eating a cheeseburger, which can be considered aggressive driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 had an asthmatic condition and required medication immediately after the crash. It is mentioned that he had taken medication on an empty stomach, which could have contributed to his impaired judgment and reaction time. Although the driver of Vehicle #1 claimed that an uninvolved vehicle refused to let him into its lane, it is ultimately the responsibility of Vehicle #1 to yield and merge safely into traffic. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to failure to yield right of way and engaging in aggressive driving behavior.
