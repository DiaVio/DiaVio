The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a significantly higher speed of 159 kmph (99 mph) at the time of the crash, which is well above the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). - The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, having consumed ten beers prior to the crash. - V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, chasing another vehicle and attempting to catch up with it. - The driver of V1 made a decision error by veering right into lane three without being aware of the presence of V2, resulting in the collision. These factors indicate that V1's actions, including speeding, aggressive driving, and driving under the influence, were the primary causes of the crash.
