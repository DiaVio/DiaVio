The reason for this is that the driver of V3 took his eyes off the road to retrieve his cell phone, causing him to become distracted. As a result, he failed to notice the stopped traffic ahead and was unable to react in time to avoid colliding with V2, which then pushed V2 into V1. This indicates that the driver of V3 was not exercising proper attention and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front of him.
