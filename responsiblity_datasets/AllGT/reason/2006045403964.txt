The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering. The driver of V2 stated that she looked left, right, and straight ahead before entering the intersection, but she did not see V1 (the Ford F150) until just before the collision occurred. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the approaching vehicle. Additionally, V2 was engaged in a non-driving activity (smoking) at the time of the crash, which further distracted her from properly observing the intersection. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and engagement in a non-driving activity make her primarily responsible for the crash.
