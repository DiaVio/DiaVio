The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep while driving, which is a driver-related non-performance error. This admission, along with the fact that V1's vehicle impacted the back of V2, indicates that V1 failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle and was unable to avoid the collision even after waking up. V2 (the driver of the 2005 Kia Sedona) cannot be attributed with primary responsibility as they were stopped ahead of V1 in the same lane and did not contribute to the cause of the collision.
