The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to detect V2 before crossing the intersection. The driver admitted to being lost in thought and not paying attention to the approaching traffic. This inattention and failure to observe the oncoming vehicle led to the collision. V2 (the GMC Envoy) also bears some responsibility for the accident. The driver of V2 failed to look to either side before proceeding through the intersection, assuming that V1 would let them pass. This recognition error and assumption contributed to the collision. However, V1's failure to yield the right of way and not observing the oncoming vehicle makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
