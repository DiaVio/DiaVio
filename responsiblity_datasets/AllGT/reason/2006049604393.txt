The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving too fast for the rain and wet road conditions. The driver admitted to going about 50-60 mph (80-100 kph) before encountering a puddle of standing water on the roadway. Although the driver slowed down and drove over the puddle, they then accelerated again. When V2 unexpectedly stopped in front of V1, the driver was unable to avoid the collision due to their excessive speed for the conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust their speed to the wet road conditions and maintain a safe following distance is the primary reason for the crash.
