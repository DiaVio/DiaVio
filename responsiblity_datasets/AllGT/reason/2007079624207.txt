The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by her cell phone ringing and failed to pay attention to the road ahead. This distraction caused her to not notice that V2 (the Ford Expedition) had stopped in the travel lane, resulting in the front of V1 colliding with the rear of V2.
