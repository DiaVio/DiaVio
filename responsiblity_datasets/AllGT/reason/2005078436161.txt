The driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, as evidenced by their involvement in a race with a non-contact vehicle. This aggressive behavior led to the driver of V1 having to abruptly steer their vehicle to the left and apply the brakes when the non-contact vehicle stopped suddenly in front of them. Additionally, V1 had mismatched tire sizes on the front and rear of the vehicle, with minimal tread depth and underinflation. As a result of these factors, V1 skidded for a significant distance before colliding with the rear of V2 (the 2001 Honda Accord), which was stopped in the traffic lane for a red light. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest partially in the number one and two lanes of the northbound lanes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to their aggressive driving behavior, inadequate tire maintenance, and failure to maintain control of their vehicle.
