The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver of V1 stated that she did not know the color of the light before entering the intersection and only realized after the collision that the lights were out due to a power outage. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that there was a car in front of her that rolled through the intersection, indicating that she should have been aware of the potential danger. On the other hand, V2 (Vehicle two) was stopped at the intersection and proceeded into the intersection after the north and southbound traffic had stopped to let it cross. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the crossing street, across the path. However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the situation at the intersection.
