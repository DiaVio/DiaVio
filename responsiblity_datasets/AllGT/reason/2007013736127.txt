The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and the snowy weather. This is evident from the driver's statement that she applied the brakes when the vehicle began to spin and felt the ABS engage. Despite this, she continued to rotate until she departed the roadway, struck a tree, and rolled over. The critical pre-crash event and critical reason coded for V1 also support the conclusion that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions and slick roads. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust her speed to the hazardous road conditions.
