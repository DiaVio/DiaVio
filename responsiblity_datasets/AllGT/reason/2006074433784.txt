The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted by reaching over to put an object in the glove compartment and attempting to close the door. This distraction caused V1 to travel off the road, striking a guardrail and a jersey barrier. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; internal distraction."
