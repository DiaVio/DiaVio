The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and struck the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, V1 fled the scene after the crash, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility and accountability.
