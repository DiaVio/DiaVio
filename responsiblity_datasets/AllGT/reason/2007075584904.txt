The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 40 kmph (25 mph) on an icy road, which is too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced in driving on icy roads, as stated in the critical reason for the crash. This combination of excessive speed and lack of experience led to V1 losing control, rotating counterclockwise, and entering the eastbound lane, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2 (the Jeep Cherokee).
