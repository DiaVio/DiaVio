The reason for this is that V2 admitted to turning left at the intersection without having a clear view of the opposite direction traffic due to the red vans blocking his view. Despite not being able to see properly, V2 proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in a collision with V1. This indicates a failure on V2's part to exercise caution and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
