The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit, and passing other vehicles. The witness confirmed that V1 was traveling at a speed of 80-85 mph (129-137 kmph) before the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.18, which is well above the legal limit. The critical event and critical reason for the crash were both attributed to the driver's error of traveling too fast for the curve. The driver's aggressive driving (speeding) and alcohol use were contributing factors to the crash. Furthermore, the driver mentioned being unhappy with his job and had been drinking beer for three hours prior to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, impaired state, and failure to negotiate the curve safely.
