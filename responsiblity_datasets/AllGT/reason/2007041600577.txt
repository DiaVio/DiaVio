The primary responsibility lies with the pedestrian who was running across the highway from the right side bushes, which is prohibited on this high-speed, high-volume roadway. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see the pedestrian until he was in front of his car, making it too late to respond. The driver was traveling at the posted speed limit and was unable to hit the brakes or avoid the pedestrian due to the surprise nature of the incident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was in the middle lane with cars on both sides, which made it difficult for him to see to his right. The road was also lighted but it was nighttime, which further reduced visibility. The driver's listening to the radio, although a potential associative factor, was not identified as a distraction in this case. In summary, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the pedestrian who ran into the roadway, violating the prohibition on pedestrians and causing the collision with V1.
