The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was charged with DUI and was found to have left the roadway on the right side, striking a utility pole. This indicates that the driver of V1 was impaired and made an error in vehicle control, leading to the initial crash. Although V2 was changing lanes to avoid the broken utility pole, V1's return onto the roadway and subsequent impact with V2's left side suggests that V1's actions were the main cause of the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that she did not see V1 until the impact, indicating that V1 may not have had its lights on, further supporting V1's primary responsibility. Overall, V1's impaired driving and initial crash with the utility pole, followed by the subsequent impact with V2, make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
