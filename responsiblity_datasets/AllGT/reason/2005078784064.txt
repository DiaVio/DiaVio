The driver of V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 and entered the intersection without checking for traffic. This is evident from the fact that V2 approached the stop sign, came to a complete stop, and then proceeded to enter the intersection without properly looking to either side. The critical reason for the critical event is coded to V2 as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver failed to look or looked but did not see V1 approaching.
