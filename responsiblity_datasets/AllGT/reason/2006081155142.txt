The driver of V1 admitted to assuming that V2 was parking in the center lane and did not realize that V2 was attempting a right turn. This assumption led to V1 not anticipating V2's actions and failing to yield the right of way. Additionally, the driver of V1 was speeding and going too fast for the wet road conditions, which further contributed to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was preparing to make a right turn and swung partially into the center lane. While this action may have contributed to the collision, the false assumption of V1 yielding played a lesser role in comparison to V1's failure to anticipate and yield to V2's right turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to yield the right of way and their excessive speed for the road conditions.
