The critical pre-crash event for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling and crossing over (passing through) the intersection. Additionally, the critical reason for this event is coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that the driver of V1 made an error, although the specific type of error is not specified. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 (the driver of the 1998 Chevrolet Lumina) is coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." The critical reason for this event is "not coded to this vehicle," indicating that V2's actions were not the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to a driver-related error.
