The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kph (60 mph) in a posted speed limit zone of 80 kph (50 mph), which indicates that she was exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, V1's right side tires dropped off the right side of the pavement, and when the driver attempted to steer back to the left, she overcorrected and crossed the center line of the roadway. This indicates a loss of control of the vehicle. Furthermore, the fact that V1 impacted a tree and rolled onto its left side suggests that the driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle after the initial overcorrection. The darkness and the wet road conditions may have also contributed to the driver's inability to properly navigate the curve. Therefore, based on the driver's excessive speed, loss of control, and failure to navigate the curve safely, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
