The driver of Vehicle 2 crossed the center line and struck the left rear axles of Vehicle 1 (the Sterling L9500 dump truck). The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle 2 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the Critical Reason was a driver-related factor of inattention. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 2 had medical conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure, and COPD) and wore glasses for a nearsighted condition, which may have contributed to the inattention. No associated vehicle factors were present for either vehicle.
