The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which led to him crossing over the left lane line into the path of V2 (the Honda Accord). V1 took no avoidance actions, indicating a lack of awareness or responsiveness to the situation. Although V2 attempted to avoid the impact by braking and steering right, they were unable to prevent the collision. The driver of V2 reported seeing V1 crossing into their path without any apparent reason. While V2 had an associated factor of tire/wheel deficiency due to oversized and under-inflated tires, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility for causing the initial collision. V1's driver falling asleep and crossing into the opposite lane was the critical pre-crash event that led to the sideswipe between the two vehicles.
