The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right-of-way to V2 (the driver of the Ford Grand Marquis) when exiting the driveway. V1 was distracted by dropping his cell phone and attempting to retrieve it while driving, which led to a recognition error and inattention. Additionally, the low tire pressure in the rear tires of V1 may have contributed to the loss of control and the subsequent collision with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right-of-way and the driver's distracted driving are the main factors that make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
