The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it crossed the double yellow line into the northbound lane, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle Two (V2), the 2001 Toyota 4Runner SUV. V1 lost control on the icy road surface, causing it to veer into the opposite lane of traffic. This action directly led to the collision and subsequent injuries to the right front occupant of V1.
