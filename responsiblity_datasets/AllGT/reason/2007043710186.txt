The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the authorized speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). - V1 ran off the road to the right after successfully negotiating a left curve, indicating poor directional control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. - V1 re-entered the roadway, crossed the double yellow line, and departed the road to the left, further demonstrating a lack of control. - V1 attempted to steer right to avoid colliding with a tree but was unsuccessful, indicating a failure to react appropriately to the situation. - V1 struck two large trees, causing the closed tailgate to be ripped off the vehicle and travel to the opposite side of the roadway, indicating a loss of control and impact with stationary objects. - V1 then overturned, leading with the right side, and the driver was ejected from the vehicle, resulting in her death. - V1 rolled and struck three more trees before coming to a final rest in a grass ditch on its top, further demonstrating a lack of control and multiple impacts with stationary objects. - The police reported travel speed for V1 was 105 kmph, significantly exceeding the authorized speed limit and contributing to the loss of control. Therefore, based on the driver's excessive speed, poor directional control, failure to react appropriately, and multiple impacts with stationary objects, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
