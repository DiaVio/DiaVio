The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted to pass V2 (the 1990 John Deere tractor) without ensuring it was safe to do so. This resulted in V1's right front striking the left back of V2's trailer, causing a chain reaction of collisions and ultimately leading to V1's rollover and the driver's fatal injuries. Additionally, the witness at the scene reported that the driver of V1 was talking on a cell phone at the time of the first impact, indicating a potential distraction and lack of attention to the road. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation, attempt an unsafe pass, and potential distraction from using a cell phone contribute to their primary responsibility for the crash.
