The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others. Specifically, V1 was unable to stop in time when the forward traffic stopped on a green light to make way for an emergency vehicle traveling through the intersection. This failure to adjust speed and react appropriately resulted in V1 striking the rear of V2, which then forced V2 into the rear of V3.
