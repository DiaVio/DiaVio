The reason for this is that V1's driver experienced a seizure while traveling north, causing them to cross the center-line into the southbound lane and collide with V2 (the driver of the 2007 Hyundai Sonata). V1 made no avoidance maneuver, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle due to the seizure. On the other hand, V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right and applying the brakes, indicating a reasonable response to the situation. However, V2 was unable to avoid the collision and was struck on the left side. Therefore, V1's seizure and resulting loss of control over the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
