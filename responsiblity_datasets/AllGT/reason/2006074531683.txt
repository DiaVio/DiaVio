The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver's diabetic reaction, which impaired his ability to control the vehicle. The driver experienced a blackout state and was lethargic and confused during the interview. The witness following V1 observed erratic driving behavior, including driving through a red light and weaving off and on the right shoulder. These actions indicate that the driver's physical impairment due to the diabetic reaction led to the vehicle departing the roadway multiple times and ultimately crashing into a field.
