The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before entering, resulting in a recognition error. V1 stated that he looked both ways but failed to see V2 approaching in lane 2. This indicates a lack of proper observation and judgment on the part of V1. Additionally, V1's defensive attitude and defensive driving behavior may have contributed to the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2004 Explorer) was traveling at the posted speed and was unable to stop or take evasive action to avoid the collision. V2's actions suggest that he was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic before entering the roadway.
