The driver of V1 admitted to following V2 at a distance of 8 meters (26 feet) and stated that he did not have time to react to V2 slowing down. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as "driver related error - driving too closely to respond to other vehicles actions." This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance, which is a violation of traffic laws and a common cause of rear-end collisions. Since V2 did not remain at the scene and no information is available about the driver or their actions, it is not possible to determine if they had any responsibility in this accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance.
