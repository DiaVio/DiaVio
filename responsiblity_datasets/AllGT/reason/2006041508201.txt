The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 had been drinking prior to the crash, as confirmed by the driver's family and the evidence found inside the vehicle. The driver's impairment due to alcohol consumption likely contributed to the driver veering off the roadway and colliding with V2 (the parked Ford F350).
