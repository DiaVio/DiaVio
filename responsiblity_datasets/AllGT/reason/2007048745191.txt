The reason for this is that V2 entered the roadway from a driveway without taking necessary precautions, such as having reflective material or lights on the pole it was carrying. This lack of visibility made it difficult for V1 to see V2 and its cargo, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2's driver admitted that the pole blocked his view of V1, indicating a failure to properly assess the situation before entering the roadway.
