The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they entered the curve and began to lose control on the icy roadway. Despite attempting to correct the control loss by applying the brakes and steering right, V1 continued to go straight after entering the curve. This resulted in V1 crossing into the eastbound lane, where it collided with V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Silverado). While V2 did encroach into the left lane to avoid a head-on collision with V1, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" and not as a contributing factor to the critical event. Additionally, V2 was able to react and steer back to the left to avoid the collision, indicating that V2 took appropriate evasive action. Therefore, V1's loss of control on the icy roadway and failure to negotiate the curve safely makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
