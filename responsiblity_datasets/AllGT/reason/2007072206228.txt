The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event coded for this vehicle. Additionally, the critical reason for this event was listed as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that the driver of V1 made an error while turning left, leading to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the 2005 Freightliner tractor-trailer) was coded with a critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error while turning left.
