The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted speed limit, between 67-80 kmph (41-50 mph), in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area and was distracted while looking for the expressway, leading to a recognition error and not seeing the red traffic light. These factors, including traveling too fast for conditions and an illegal maneuver, contributed to the driver of V1 failing to stop at the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the driver of the 2000 Buick LeSabre) had a false assumption of V1's actions, assuming that V1 would stop. While the driver of V2 was also traveling too fast for conditions, between 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph) in a 56 kmph (35 mph) zone, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to their excessive speed, unfamiliarity with the area, and distraction. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their speeding, unfamiliarity with the area, and distraction while looking for the expressway.
