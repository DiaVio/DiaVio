The driver of V1 failed to slow down and rear-ended V2, which then caused V2 to collide with V3. The driver of V1 admitted that he was not paying attention to the traffic ahead of him because he was looking in his side mirror for too long. This constitutes inadequate surveillance and a failure to look far enough ahead, which was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the rush hour congestion was an associated factor that likely contributed to the driver's failure to notice the slowing traffic.
