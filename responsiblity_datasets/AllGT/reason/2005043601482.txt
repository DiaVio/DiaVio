The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not paying attention to the traffic in his lane due to being focused on an extraneous vehicle ahead of him and daydreaming. This lack of attention caused him to fail to notice the stopped Vehicle 2 in front of him, resulting in the collision. Additionally, Vehicle 1's driver admitted to being unfamiliar with the area and the roadway he was traveling, which may have contributed to his lack of awareness. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
