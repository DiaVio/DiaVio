The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a personal problem and emotionally upset at the time of the crash. She also reported not seeing V2's approach. This indicates that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection and failed to recognize the presence of V2. Additionally, the investigation revealed that there was a concrete wall on the southeast corner that partially blocked the view of crossing traffic. However, this does not absolve the driver of V1 from responsibility as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure a safe crossing and to be aware of their surroundings. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
