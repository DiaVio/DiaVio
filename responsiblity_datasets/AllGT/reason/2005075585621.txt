The reason for this is that V1 did not stop for V2, which was stopped at a red light, and collided with the back of V2. V1 then entered the intersection and collided with V3, which had entered the intersection and was turning left. The police report indicated that V1 was speeding, estimated to be 97 kmph (60 mph) in a 64 kmph (40 mph) speed limit zone. Additionally, the driver of V1 experienced a hypoglycemic episode, which caused a loss of control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for a stopped vehicle, speeding, and the driver's physical impairment due to a hypoglycemic episode contribute to V1 being primarily responsible for the crash.
