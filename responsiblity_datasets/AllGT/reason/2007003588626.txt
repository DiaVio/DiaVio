The driver of V3 rear-ended V2, which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V1. The driver of V3 stated that he was unable to stop or avoid hitting V2 because the car in front of him stopped suddenly. The critical reason for the critical event in V3 was "inattention," and an associated factor was following too closely. Therefore, V3's failure to maintain a safe following distance and pay attention to the road ahead led to the collision.
