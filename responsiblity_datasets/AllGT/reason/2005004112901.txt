The driver of V1 was stopped at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection after being waved in by an unknown vehicle. However, the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection and did not see V2 approaching in the second travel lane. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling at a relatively low speed of between 18 and 32 kmph (11 and 20 mph) at the time of impact, while V2 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph). This suggests that V1 may not have been able to accurately judge the speed and distance of V2, further contributing to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
