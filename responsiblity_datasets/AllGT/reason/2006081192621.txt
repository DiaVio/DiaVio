The driver was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the wet road conditions, which resulted in a loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's statement that he may have blown a tire does not absolve him of responsibility, as the vehicle inspection revealed that the only flat tire was the right front tire. Therefore, the driver's failure to adjust his speed to the road conditions and maintain control of the vehicle makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
