The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep behind the wheel, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle. This is supported by the Critical Precrash Event coded to V1, which indicates that the vehicle traveled off the edge of the roadway on the right side due to the driver being asleep. Additionally, the Critical Reason coded to V1 is "sleeping, that is actually asleep," further confirming the driver's admission. V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) was not involved in the first harmful event and was simply driving in her lane when V1 swerved into her lane and struck her vehicle. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
