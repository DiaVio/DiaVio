The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he entered the intersection on a red light and failed to recognize the presence of V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) coming from his left. V1's inadequate surveillance, possibly due to sun glare, led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was unfamiliar with the route, which may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation at the intersection.
