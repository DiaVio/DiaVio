The reason for Vi's responsibility is that the driver exhibited poor directional control and failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was traveling faster than normal due to being afraid of being late for work. The medical record also indicates that the driver of Vi was intoxicated with ethanol, although the specific blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level was not reported. These factors, including the driver's impaired state and excessive speed, contribute to Vi's responsibility for the collision.
