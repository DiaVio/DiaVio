The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the road before turning right onto the east/west roadway. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V2 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic in lane two, where V1 (the motorcycle) was traveling. This failure to look and see the approaching motorcycle resulted in V2 moving into lane two and causing the collision with V1.
