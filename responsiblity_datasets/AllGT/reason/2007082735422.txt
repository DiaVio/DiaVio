The reason for this is that V1 initiated an illegal U-turn across the eastbound lanes, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, V1 was unfamiliar with the area, which may have contributed to the driver's lack of awareness of oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Silverado pick-up truck) was traveling in the correct lane and was unable to avoid the collision when V1 encroached into their path from the parking lane. However, V2's inability to be interviewed and the lack of information regarding their speed make it difficult to fully assess their level of responsibility in this case.
