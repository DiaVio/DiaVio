The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead. She admitted to looking away for a second to check traffic in the adjacent lane, and when she looked back, she realized that V2 had already come to a complete stop. Despite applying her brakes, she was unable to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1's driver was not paying sufficient attention to the road and failed to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of her in a timely manner. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
