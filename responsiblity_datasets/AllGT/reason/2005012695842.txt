The driver of V1 made a left-hand turn onto the roadway without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This recognition error led to the collision with V2 (the 1988 Pontiac Bonneville). While the driver of V2 was traveling slightly above the posted speed limit, the critical reason for the accident was not coded to him. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for failing to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left-hand turn.
