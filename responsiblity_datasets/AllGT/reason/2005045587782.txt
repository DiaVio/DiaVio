The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before attempting to turn left. Despite stopping and looking in both directions, the driver did not see Vehicle #1 (the 1997 Ford F-150) approaching and initiated the turn too slowly, resulting in a collision with Vehicle #1. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
