The reason for this is that V1 drifted left and crossed the center yellow lines into the lane of oncoming traffic, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 2005 Ford Excursion). The driver of V1 disclosed that he blacked out due to a brain bleed sustained from a fall three weeks prior to the crash. This physical impairment of the ability to act caused him to lose consciousness and relinquish control of the vehicle, leading to the collision.
