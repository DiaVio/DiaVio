The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the traffic before making a left-hand turn onto the roadway. She stated that her sight of the trafficway was restricted by another vehicle turning into the driveway she was exiting, but she proceeded without having a clear view of traffic approaching from her left. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2. While the driver of V2 stated that she saw V1, she did not anticipate that V1 would pull out. However, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility as the driver of V1 had the duty to ensure it was safe to make the left-hand turn before proceeding onto the roadway.
