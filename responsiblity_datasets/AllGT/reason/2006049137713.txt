The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One experienced a blowout or flat tire, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle. The tread separation in the left rear tire was identified as the critical reason for the loss of control. As a result, Vehicle One veered off the original travel lane, rolled onto its top, and slid across the service road before coming to a rest.
