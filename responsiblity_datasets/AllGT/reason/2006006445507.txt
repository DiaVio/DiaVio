The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to yield to the emergency vehicle (V2) that had its lights activated and was responding to an emergency call. Despite having a green light, V1 should have noticed the flashing lights and sirens of V2 and taken appropriate action to yield the right of way. V1's inadequate surveillance, as indicated by smoking and listening to the radio while driving, likely contributed to their failure to notice the emergency vehicle.
