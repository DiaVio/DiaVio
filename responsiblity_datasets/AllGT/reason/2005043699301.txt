The reason for V1's responsibility is that it initiated the lane change by merging left into V2's lane. This action caused V2 (2001 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup) to steer left towards the shoulder to avoid the crash. As a result, V1 swerved right, departed the roadway, and struck the barrier wall. Both vehicles then reentered the roadway and collided, with V2's right rear colliding with V1's front left. V2 then departed the roadway to the right, overturning and coming to rest on its undercarriage. Although V2 lost control and overturned, it was a direct consequence of V1's initial lane change. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
