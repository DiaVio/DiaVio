The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. This decision error led to V1 striking V2 in the left front, causing V2 to be pushed off the road and resulting in the need for V2 to be towed from the scene. V2, on the other hand, had a green light at the intersection and attempted to avoid the collision by steering to the right, but was unable to prevent the crash. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn make them primarily responsible for the accident.
