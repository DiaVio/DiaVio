The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. When the vehicle ahead of V2 slowed rapidly, V2 had to steer left into another lane to avoid a collision. However, V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the left rear of V2, causing V2 to rotate and subsequently collide with V3. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust her speed and maintain a safe following distance led to the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
