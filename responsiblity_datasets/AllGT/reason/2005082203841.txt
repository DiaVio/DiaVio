The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection to make a left turn, without yielding the right of way to V2 (the BMW 318 coupe) which was approaching from the south on the main roadway. V2 struck the left rear of V1, indicating that V1 failed to properly judge the gap and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
