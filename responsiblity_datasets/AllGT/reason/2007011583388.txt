The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to stop at the intersection and collided with V2 (the Chevrolet Trailblazer). V1 admitted to not stopping and stated that their brakes did not respond as expected. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 89 kmph (55 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). The foggy conditions and the driver's inexperience further contributed to the accident. V2, on the other hand, was traveling at or near the speed limit, had their headlights on, and stated that they did not think the fog was that bad. While V2 may have had a sightline restriction due to the fog, their actions do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop, excessive speed, and lack of experience in handling the foggy conditions.
