The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before pulling out. The driver stated that she looked in both directions but did not look back to the left again to see V2 approaching. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the dip in the road made it difficult to see oncoming vehicles, but it is still expected for drivers to exercise caution and ensure it is safe to proceed. On the other hand, V2 (the 2006 Hummer H3) had the right of way as it was traveling on the southbound road. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 creeping past the stop sign but assumed it would stop. However, V2's driver attempted to steer to the left to avoid the collision but did not have enough time to do so. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
