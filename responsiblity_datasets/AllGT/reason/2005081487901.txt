The reason for this is that V1 driver overcompensated while trying to avoid a non-contact vehicle that changed lanes into V1's path. This overcompensation led to V1 losing control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision with the concrete barrier and subsequent fire. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control.
