The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was distracted by looking for a street sign and talking on his handheld cell phone while driving, which caused a driver recognition error. - V1 failed to notice that his light had changed from green to red until he was already under the red light. - V1 admitted to being lost and unfamiliar with the roadway, which could have contributed to his lack of awareness. - V1 also performed an illegal maneuver by failing to stop for the red light. These factors indicate that V1's actions and distractions were the primary cause of the accident.
