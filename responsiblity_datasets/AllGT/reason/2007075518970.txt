The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy roadway and curve conditions. The driver let off the accelerator to slow down, but still lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. The driver's decision to steer into the rotation further contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the underinflated tires on V1 may have further compromised the vehicle's ability to maintain traction on the icy road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed to the conditions and maintain control of the vehicle.
