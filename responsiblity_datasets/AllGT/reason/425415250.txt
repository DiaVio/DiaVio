The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northeast towards a stop sign at the intersection and began turning left, crossing into V1's lane of travel. This action resulted in a head-on collision with V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and turning left into oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
