The driver of Vehicle One stated that he had the green light and was traveling through the intersection when he collided with Vehicle Two. However, the critical reason coded to Vehicle One was "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver failed to adequately observe the intersection before proceeding. Additionally, the associated factors coded to the driver of Vehicle One include "looked but did not see" and "false assumption," suggesting that he may have made assumptions about the actions of other drivers without verifying them. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle Two stated that he was traveling through the intersection on a green light when his vehicle was struck by Vehicle One. Although there is some uncertainty about the color of the light, the lack of information and the partial interview make it difficult to determine the primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, based on the available information, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and false assumptions.
