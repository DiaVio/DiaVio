The reason for this is that V1 was traveling south on a two-lane rural road and crossed the centerline, ultimately departing the left side of the road. V1 then collided with a tree trunk, resulting in the injuries sustained by the occupants. The impact began just outside the left front bumper corner, indicating that V1 was not properly maintaining its lane and veered off the road, leading to the collision with the tree trunk.
