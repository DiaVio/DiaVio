The reason for this is that V2 was traveling through the intersection and failed to stop in time, resulting in the collision with V1. The driver of V2 stated that the brakes did not grab and the brake system fluid reservoir was extremely low on brake fluid, indicating a degraded braking capability. This suggests that V2 was unable to stop in time due to a mechanical issue with the vehicle's brakes.
