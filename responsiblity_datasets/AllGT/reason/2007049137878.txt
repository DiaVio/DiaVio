The reason for this is that V1 attempted to merge into the third lane without adequately checking for traffic in that lane. The driver of V1 stated that he looked into his rearview mirror and thought that lane three was clear, but he did not see V2 prior to impact. This indicates that V1 failed to properly surveil the area before changing lanes, which is a driver-related factor and a form of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the case summary mentions that view obstruction due to vehicle design was a contributing factor. This suggests that V1's vehicle design may have hindered the driver's ability to see V2, but it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to change lanes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to properly check for traffic before merging into the third lane.
