The reason for this is that V2 was traveling south in the right through lane and began to drift to the right, entering the right turn lane where V1 was stopped. V2 continued forward and slightly to the right into the intersection, ultimately striking the left side of V1. This indicates that V2 failed to maintain its lane and collided with V1, causing the accident.
