The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to properly negotiate the left turn at the intersection. The skid marks and impact with the curb indicate that the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to veer off the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The subsequent impact with the steel light pole resulted in severe damage to V1 and injuries to both the driver and front right passenger.
