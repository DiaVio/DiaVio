The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, even though the traffic signals were not functioning due to the storm. The driver stated that he saw the light turn green and proceeded into the intersection, indicating a lack of proper surveillance. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance, specifically looking but not seeing, was the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event of vehicle one. On the other hand, the driver of vehicle two (1993 Nissan Altima) noted that the signals were not functioning and had been stopped for 1-2 seconds prior to entering the intersection. He accelerated when he noticed that vehicle one was not stopping. Although vehicle two was involved in the crash, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street across path," indicating that the primary responsibility lies with vehicle one. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance.
