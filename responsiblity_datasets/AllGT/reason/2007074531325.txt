The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 experienced a non-disabling vehicle problem, specifically the accelerator sticking. However, instead of applying the brakes, the driver panicked or froze, which led to a loss of control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 sliding off the road, striking a curb, and ultimately colliding with a sign post. While the driver's fatigue and medical conditions may have contributed to his ability to react quickly, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's failure to properly respond to the non-disabling vehicle problem.
