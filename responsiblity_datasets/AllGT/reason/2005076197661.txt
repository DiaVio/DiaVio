The driver of V1 was distracted and bent over to pick up his hat, which caused him to collide with the rear end of V2 (the 1997 Ford F-350 pickup). This indicates that V1's driver was not paying attention to the road and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
