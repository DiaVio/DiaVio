The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost consciousness while driving, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and striking a utility pole. The driver's physical impairment, specifically the loss of consciousness, prevented them from being able to avoid the crash. Additionally, factors such as fatigue and the use of insulin to control diabetes were associated with the driver, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident.
