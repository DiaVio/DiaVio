The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 was making a U-turn from the left turn lane and failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before initiating the turn. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 crossing into the path of V2 (the 2002 Pontiac Grand Am) which was proceeding through the intersection on a green light. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1 did not have a valid driver's license for the state and had low tread depths on the tires, which could have contributed to the driver's ability to control the vehicle during the turn. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
