The reason for this is that V1 lost control and spun counter-clockwise towards the center barrier on the left. The police report lists driving too fast for conditions as a contributing factor, specifically stating that the speed was too great for the wet roadway, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and depart the roadway. Additionally, driver inattention was also listed as a contributing factor, although the report did not provide further details on this. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's excessive speed for the wet conditions and possible driver inattention are the main factors that led to the collision.
