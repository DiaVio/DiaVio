The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at a red light, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, V1 stated that the light changed too quickly, but this does not excuse their failure to stop in time. The driver of V1 also argued that the driver of V2 should have seen their big truck in the intersection and avoided the collision, but this argument does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for running a red light.
