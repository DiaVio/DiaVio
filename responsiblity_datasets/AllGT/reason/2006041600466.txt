The reason for this is that V2 admitted in the interview that he was distracted by reading directions at the time of the crash. He stated that before looking down, there were no cars in front of him and V1 made an improper lane change into his lane. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to maintain proper attention and focus on the road, especially in a situation where there is potential for lane changes or other vehicles to be present. Therefore, V2's distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance contributed to the crash, making them primarily responsible.
