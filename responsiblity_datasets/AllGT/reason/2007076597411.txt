The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed on a road with washboard conditions, which can make it difficult to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as it was his first time on the road and he had only been driving for two weeks with no driver training, likely contributed to his poor directional control and inability to handle the vehicle properly. The driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, along with the factors of traveling too fast for the road conditions and being an inexperienced driver, all point to V1 being primarily responsible for the accident.
