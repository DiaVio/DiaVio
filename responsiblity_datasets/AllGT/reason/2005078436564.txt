The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not fully focused on the road. The witness reported that the driver was changing a CD and admitted to being distracted at the time of the crash. This distraction caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle and veer off the roadway, ultimately resulting in the collision with the power pole.
