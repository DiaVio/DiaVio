The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was distracted and looking down in the passenger toe pan while negotiating the curve. This internal distraction caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in the right rear wheel dropping off the shoulder and subsequently rolling over. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions and the presence of alcohol in the driver further contributed to the crash. The fact that the roadway was under construction may have also played a role in the driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle.
