The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 admitted to looking to the left and not seeing V2 until the last second. This indicates a failure to properly check for oncoming vehicles before making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Durango) was traveling within the speed limit and saw V1 as he approached the intersection. He applied the brakes when he realized that V1 was entering the intersection, indicating that he took appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
