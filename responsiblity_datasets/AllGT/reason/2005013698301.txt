The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving, which resulted in the vehicle departing the roadway. Additionally, the driver stated that he overcompensated when trying to steer back onto the road, causing the vehicle to rotate and ultimately roll over. The driver's fatigue, alcohol use, and stress from work are also contributing factors to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's negligence in falling asleep, overcompensating, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
