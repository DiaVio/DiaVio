The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event of the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. Factors such as traveling too fast, engaging in conversation with the passenger, low tread on the tires, and the wet road conditions all contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle. This resulted in the vehicle striking an object on the right underside, causing it to flip and spin before coming to a stop. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's performance error of poor directional control and the associated contributing factors.
