The reason for this is that V2 made a wide right turn from a northbound T-intersection street onto the eastbound trafficway, entering into the westbound lane where it collided with another vehicle. After the initial collision, V2 stopped and then continued eastbound, swerving into and out of the eastbound lane until finally entering the path of Vehicle 1 (V1). This erratic behavior and failure to maintain control of the vehicle contributed to the accident.
