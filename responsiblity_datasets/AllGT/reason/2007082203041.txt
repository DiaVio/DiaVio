The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at too great a speed for the wet road conditions, as indicated by the witness statement and the vehicle and pole damage. Additionally, the driver's poor directional control and inadequate evasive actions further contribute to their responsibility for the collision.
