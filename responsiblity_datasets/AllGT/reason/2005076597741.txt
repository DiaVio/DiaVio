Reason: 1. V1 was traveling at the same speed as V2 (72 kmph) and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the collision. 2. The driver of V1 tested positive for methamphetamine and cannabinoids, indicating possible impairment and reduced ability to react to the situation. 3. The police report mentioned inattention as a factor for the driver of V1, suggesting a lack of focus or distraction while driving. 4. There was no evidence of skid marks or avoidance actions taken by the driver of V1, indicating a failure to react or attempt to avoid the collision. Overall, the combination of impaired driving, inattention, and failure to maintain a safe distance makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
