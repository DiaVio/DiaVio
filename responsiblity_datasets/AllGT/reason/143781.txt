The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to cargo shifting and jamming the driver's cane against the accelerator pedal. This caused V1 to accelerate and subsequently collide with Vehicle Two (V2) in a sideswipe manner. Despite attempting to avoid further collisions, V1 continued to accelerate and ultimately collided with Vehicle Three (V3) in a T-type configuration. Therefore, V1's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and the subsequent collisions make it primarily responsible for the accident.
