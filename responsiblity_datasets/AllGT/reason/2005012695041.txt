The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had a seizure while driving, which caused her to temporarily lose control of her vehicle. The medical records indicate that she had a long history of seizure activity and was taking medication to control it. The seizure medication she was taking had possible side effects of sedation, weakness, and sleepiness, which could have impaired her ability to drive safely. Additionally, there was no evidence of any braking on the part of V1, indicating that the driver did not take any action to avoid the collision. V1 also struck the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was properly stopped at a red light and took no actions that contributed to the crash. She was not found to have any health problems or be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's seizure and failure to maintain a safe distance.
