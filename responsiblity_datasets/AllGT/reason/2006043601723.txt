The reason for this is that V2 was traveling the wrong way down a one-way driveway, ignoring all traffic control devices in the parking lot. This illegal maneuver directly led to the collision with V1. Additionally, the witness on-scene confirmed that V2 was rapidly crossing through the parking lot, further indicating a disregard for traffic rules and safety.
