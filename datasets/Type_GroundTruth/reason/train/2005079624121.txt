This is because Vehicle 2 (V2) collided with the right side of Vehicle 1 (V1) in the intersection, with V2 traveling west and V1 traveling north. The impact occurred when the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1, resulting in both vehicles side-slapping and V1 subsequently striking a utility pole. This scenario fits the description of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
