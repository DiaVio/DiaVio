This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection against the light and its front contacted the back left corner of Vehicle 2 (V2). After the initial contact, V1 was struck on its right side by the front of Vehicle 3 (V3). This sequence of events indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V3), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
