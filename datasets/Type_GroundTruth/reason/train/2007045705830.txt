Justification: V1 (1992 Honda Accord) was traveling east on the secondary arterial and had slowed to make a left turn to head north on the primary road. V2 (2000 Acura RL) was traveling west through the intersection from the east leg. V1's front (right corner) struck the front of V2. This collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another (V2) is a typical front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
