This is because the accident involves only one vehicle, the 2000 Honda Accord, and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver lost control of the vehicle while trying to avoid hitting a lounge chair in the middle of the roadway, resulting in the vehicle colliding with the concrete barrier wall.
