This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) impacted the rear-end of Vehicle 2 (V2), pushing it forward and causing it to collide with the rear-end of V2's trailer. The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention and looking down inside her vehicle before the collision occurred. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction while decelerating," indicating that V2 was slowing down for traffic ahead, which contributed to the Rear-End Collision.
