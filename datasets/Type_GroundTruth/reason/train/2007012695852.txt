Justification: The accident occurred when the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes to the left, not seeing V2 in the adjacent lane. As a result, the left side of V1 made contact with the right side of V2. This describes a collision where the front of one vehicle (V1) collides with the side of another (V2), commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
