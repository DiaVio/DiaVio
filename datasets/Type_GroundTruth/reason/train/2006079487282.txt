This is because the accident involves only one vehicle, the 1997 Nissan Altima, and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The vehicle departed the roadway to the right, impacting a curb and a fire hydrant, and came to rest on the sidewalk. The driver's explanation of veering to the left to avoid a bicyclist was found to be false as there was no bicyclist at the scene. The critical pre-crash event was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that the accident was caused by the driver's inadequate surveillance.
