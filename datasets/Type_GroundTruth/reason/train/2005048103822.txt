Justification:
- Vehicle 1 (V1) was attempting to turn left at the intersection, and it was impacted on its left rear by Vehicle 2 (V2).
- V1 rotated and its front plane impacted the front plane of Vehicle 3 (V3).
- V1's front colliding with the side of V3 is indicative of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
