The accident involved only one vehicle, the Toyota Corolla, and there were no other entities involved. The driver of the vehicle reported falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle drifting off the road and colliding with a bridge abutment and guardrail. The accident occurred due to a critical non-performance error by the driver, who was fatigued and inexperienced.
