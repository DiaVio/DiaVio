This is evident from the description that Vehicle 1 (V1) attempted a left turn and was hit on its right side front by the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), causing V1's side to slap. This collision occurred at an intersection, with V1 traveling west and V2 traveling east, resulting in a T-bone collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1.
