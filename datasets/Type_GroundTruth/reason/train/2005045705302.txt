This is because Vehicle #1 (Chevrolet Silverado) ran a red light and struck Vehicle #2 (Ford Focus) in the left side front with its front, causing Vehicle #2 to spin clockwise and then striking Vehicle #2 in the left side rear with its right side. This collision scenario matches the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, commonly referred to as a "T-bone" collision.
