This is because V1 (Nissan Altima) impacted the right side of V2 (Acura RL), and then the right side of V2 contacted the front of V3 (Ford Explorer). This sequence of events indicates a collision where the front of one vehicle (V1) collides with the side of another (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
