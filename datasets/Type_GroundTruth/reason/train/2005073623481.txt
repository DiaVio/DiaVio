This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (a Chevrolet Monte Carlo sedan) and no other entities were mentioned. The driver lost control while negotiating a left curve, resulting in the vehicle rotating and ultimately impacting a utility pole and a phone box before coming to a rest off the roadway.
