Justification: The accident occurred when V1, which was traveling north on the arterial road, passed through a red light and struck V2 on its left side with its front. V2 was turning left/south onto the arterial from the side street. This collision involves the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which fits the definition of a Front-to-Side Collision.
