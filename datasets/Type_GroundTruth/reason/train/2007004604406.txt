The vehicle involved, V1, departed the roadway and struck a utility pole and a billboard without any involvement or collision with another vehicle. The driver's statement about being forced off the road by an unknown vehicle is inconsistent and unsupported by any evidence at the scene. Additionally, there is no indication of any avoidance maneuvers made by V1.
