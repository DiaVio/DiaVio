This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (1993 Ford F-150 pickup truck) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. The driver fell asleep at the wheel, causing the vehicle to cross over the centerline, exit the roadway, and collide with a rock wall and utility wire.
