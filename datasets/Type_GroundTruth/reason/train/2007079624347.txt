This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection and its front plane contacted the left plane of Vehicle 2 (V2) in a side-slap manner. Both vehicles then traveled towards a stopped Vehicle 3 (V3), with the front plane of V2 contacting the front plane of V3, and the front plane of V1 also contacting the front plane of V3. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V1) colliding with the side of another (V2), which is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision.
