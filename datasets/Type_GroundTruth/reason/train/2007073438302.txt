This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities or vehicles being involved. The driver of V1 lost control on an icy road, traveled off the left side of the roadway, returned to the roadway, and then traveled off the right side into a ditch, resulting in a rollover.
