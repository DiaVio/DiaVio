This is because V1 (1998 Oldsmobile Eighty-Eight) was traveling east in lane two of the secondary road and passed into the intersection on a red light. It was struck on the right side by the front of V2 (2002 Dodge Stratus), which was traveling north in lane two of the primary road. The collision occurred when V2's light had just turned green and was just starting into the intersection. The front of V2 then rotated slightly clockwise and the left side of its front bumper struck the right side of V1. V2 continued to rotate right and struck the left front of V3 (1995 Chevrolet Corsica) as it crossed into lane 1 northbound.
