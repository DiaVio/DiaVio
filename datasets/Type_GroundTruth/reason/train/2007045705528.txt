The accident occurred at a T-type intersection where V1, a 1993 Land Rover Range Rover, attempted a left turn onto the secondary arterial road. V2, a 1995 Chrysler Concorde, traveling north in the far left lane of the primary arterial, collided with the right side of V1's vehicle. V2 had swerved to the right in an attempt to avoid the collision. The description of the impact and the final resting positions of both vehicles indicate a front-to-side collision, commonly known as a T-bone collision.
