This is because vehicle 1 (a 1999 Dodge Dakota) failed to stop for a red light and was contacted on the front right side by vehicle 2 (a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt) that was accelerating into the intersection. They collided in a manner where the front of one vehicle (V2) collided with the side of the other vehicle (V1).
