Justification: Vehicle one (V1) veered right and crossed over all travel lanes, colliding with the rear of Vehicle two (V2) as it was traveling in the first lane on the off-ramp. The front of V1 contacted the left side of V2, causing V2 to skid and strike a lamp post. This scenario fits the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
