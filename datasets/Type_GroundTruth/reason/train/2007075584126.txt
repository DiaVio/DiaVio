This is because the accident involved only one vehicle, the Nissan Pathfinder, and there was no involvement of any other entities such as objects, persons, or other vehicles. The description of the accident mentions the vehicle losing control, running off the road, hitting a ditch, and ultimately rolling over onto its side.
