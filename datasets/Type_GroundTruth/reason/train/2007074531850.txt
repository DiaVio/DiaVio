This is because the front of Vehicle 1 (V1) collided with the left side of Vehicle 2 (V2) in the intersection, resulting in V2 rolling over onto its right side. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was described as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path."
