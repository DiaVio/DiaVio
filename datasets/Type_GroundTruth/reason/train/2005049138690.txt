Justification:
- V1, a Honda Civic, was turning left from the third northbound travel lane to the westbound roadway.
- V2, a Ford F-150 pick-up truck, was approaching the intersection southbound in the third travel lane.
- V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, and V2 struck V1 on the right front with its front.
- The collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1 is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, commonly known as a T-bone collision.
