This is because Vehicle 2 (V2) failed to stop and collided with the rear of Vehicle 1 (V1), causing V1 to be pushed into the eastbound lane and collide with the left rear wheel of Vehicle 3 (V3). Additionally, V1 continued in the eastbound lane and collided head-on with Vehicle 4 (V4). This sequence of events indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another (V4), which fits the definition of a Front-to-Side Collision.
