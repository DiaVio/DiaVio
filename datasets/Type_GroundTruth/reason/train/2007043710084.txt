This is because V2, the Chrysler Town & Country minivan, was struck on its left front plane by the front right corner of V1, the GMC medium/heavy dump truck, as V2 entered the intersection. This collision occurred when the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another vehicle (V2), resembling a "T-bone" collision.
