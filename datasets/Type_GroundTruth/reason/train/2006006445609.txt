This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there were no other entities involved. V1 drifted off the road, struck a utility pole, and overturned, resulting in damage to the vehicle. The driver was also cited for driving too fast for the curve and was fatigued and hungover at the time of the crash.
