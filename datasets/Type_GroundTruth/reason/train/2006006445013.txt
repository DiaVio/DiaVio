This is because the crash involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to avoid colliding with the non-contact vehicle that made an illegal U-turn in front of them. The driver of V1 swerved to the right and then to the left, resulting in the vehicle skidding off the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree and a fence.
