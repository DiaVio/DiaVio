It involves only one vehicle, the 2004 Cadillac Escalade, and no other entities. The vehicle drifted off the left side of the road, struck a concrete barrier, bounced back onto the roadway, rolled onto its roof, slid across all travel lanes, and eventually came to rest on its roof. There was no mention of another vehicle involved in the collision.
