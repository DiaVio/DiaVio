This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The description of the accident also indicates that the vehicle lost control after a right rear tire blowout and rolled over multiple times, without any mention of another vehicle being involved. Therefore, it can be concluded that this is a single-vehicle accident.
