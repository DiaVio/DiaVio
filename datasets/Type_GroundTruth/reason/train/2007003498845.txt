This is because V1, the Ford Explorer, collided with the left side of V2, the Honda CR-V, at the intersection. V1 was traveling northbound and V2 was traveling westbound, and the collision occurred when V1's front contacted the left side of V2. The vehicles came to a final rest in the center of the intersection, facing west.
