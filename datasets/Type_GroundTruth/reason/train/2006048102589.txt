This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the westbound lanes intending to turn right into lane four, and the front of V1 struck the right side of Vehicle 2 (V2). V2 then continued westbound and its front struck the back of Vehicle 3 (V3). This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V1) colliding with the side of another (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
