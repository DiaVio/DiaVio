Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was stopped in the southbound lane-four attempting to make a left turn. When the signal turned green, V1 proceeded into the intersection and was struck in the right side by the front of vehicle two (V2). This indicates that the front of V2 collided with the side of V1, which is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision.
