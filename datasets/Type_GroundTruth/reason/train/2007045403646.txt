This classification is based on the description that V1, the GMC Jimmy SUV, turned left into the path of V2, the Lincoln Continental, and was struck on the left side. V2 entered the intersection and was struck by V1's front left on the left side. This indicates a collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
