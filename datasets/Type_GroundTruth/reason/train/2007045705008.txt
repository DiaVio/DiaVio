Justification: V1, the Honda Civic, attempted to make a U-turn and collided with the right side of V2, the Chevrolet Blazer, while V2 was traveling east in lane 2. The initial impact was followed by V1's left side slapping V2's right side. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 corresponds to a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
