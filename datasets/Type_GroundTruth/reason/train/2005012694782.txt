Justification: The accident involves only one vehicle, with no other entities involved. The driver experienced a blow-out of the left front tire while negotiating a right curve on the interstate. The vehicle lost control, traveled over lanes of travel, and ultimately overturned before coming to rest. There was no mention of any other vehicle or entity involved in the accident. Therefore, it can be classified as a single-vehicle accident.
