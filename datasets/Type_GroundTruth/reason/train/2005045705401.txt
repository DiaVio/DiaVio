Justification: Vehicle #1 was traveling southbound and Vehicle #2 was making a left turn into the access road from the northbound left turn lane. The impact occurred between the front of Vehicle #1 and the side of Vehicle #2, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision or "T-bone" collision.
