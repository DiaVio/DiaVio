Justification: 
- Vehicle one (Nissan Altima) was struck by vehicle two (unknown van) when it suddenly merged into the lane of vehicle one, resulting in a collision between the front left corner of vehicle one and the unknown van. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (Nissan Altima) and the side of another vehicle (unknown van).
- Subsequently, vehicle one was struck by vehicle three (unknown vehicle) in the back left corner as vehicle one crossed lane three, which further supports a front-to-side collision.
