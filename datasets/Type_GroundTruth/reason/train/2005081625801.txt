Justification: 
- Vehicle 1 (V1) was traveling northbound and initiated a left turn, crossing the eastbound lane.
- Vehicle 2 (V2) was traveling eastbound in the number one lane and struck V1 on the driver's side.
- V1 entered a counterclockwise rotation and departed the impact on a northeast trajectory.
- V2 also entered a counterclockwise rotation and tripped over, rolling right one quarter-turn.
- V2 then slid and contacted vehicle 3 (V3) with its top plane before coming to rest on its right side.

This sequence of events indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, resulting in a Front-to-Side Collision.
