Justification: The accident occurred when vehicle two (V2) entered the roadway from a driveway and turned left, causing the front of vehicle one (V1) to strike the right side of the concrete pole being towed by V2. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V2), which fits the definition of a front-to-side collision.
