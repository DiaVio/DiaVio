This is because the accident involved only one vehicle, with no other entities involved. The driver of the Dodge Ram 3500 club cab pickup drove off the right side of the road, struck a guardrail, and then went down an embankment, ultimately coming to rest against a tree/brush line. There is no mention of any other vehicles being involved in the accident.
