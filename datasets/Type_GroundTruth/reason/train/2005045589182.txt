Justification: Vehicle #1 (Ford Taurus) was traveling east on the road, and Vehicle #2 (unknown hit and run tractor-trailer) was traveling west. As the truck negotiated the sharp curve, the front of the left rear trailer tandem struck the front left corner of the Taurus. This indicates that the front of one vehicle (the truck) collided with the side of another vehicle (the Taurus), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
