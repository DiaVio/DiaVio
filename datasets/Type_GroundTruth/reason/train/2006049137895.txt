This is because vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection and its front struck the left side of vehicle two (V2). V1 rotated counterclockwise and was struck on the right side by the left side of V2. This collision occurred when the front of one vehicle collided with the side of another vehicle, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
