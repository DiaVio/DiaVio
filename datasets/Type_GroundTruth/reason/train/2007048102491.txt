This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, struck a mailbox and a culvert, and rolled over onto its left side. The driver of V1 left the scene and was not located, indicating that no other vehicles were involved in the collision.
