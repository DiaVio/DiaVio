Vehicle 1 (Ford Bronco) was attempting to make a lane change into lane one and the left front of Vehicle 2 (Nissan Quest Minivan) scraped along the right side of Vehicle 1 as it was changing lanes. Vehicle 2's right front then hit Vehicle 1 on the right back bumper, causing Vehicle 1 to rotate counterclockwise and come to a rest against the left side concrete barrier wall.
