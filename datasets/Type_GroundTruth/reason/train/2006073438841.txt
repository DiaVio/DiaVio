Vehicle one (V1) swerved to the left to avoid a non-contacted vehicle backing into the roadway, then swerved back to the right and struck the left side of a parked vehicle (V20) on the right side of the roadway. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V20 is a typical front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
