This is because V-1 (Hyundai Elantra) entered the intersection on a green light and made a left turn across the path of V-2 (Lincoln Town Car), resulting in the front of V-1 striking the left front corner of V-2. This is a classic "T-bone" collision where the front of one vehicle collides with the side of another.
