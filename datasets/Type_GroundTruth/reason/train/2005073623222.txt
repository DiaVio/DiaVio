Justification: Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection and impacted the left side of Vehicle 2 (V2) with its front end. V2 then rotated counter clockwise off the initial impact and struck the front of Vehicle 3 (V3) with its right side. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 is a classic example of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
