This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and no other entities were mentioned. V1 lost control, crossed all four lanes of traffic, and impacted the concrete barrier with the front right of the vehicle. The final resting position is unknown, but it is clear that no other vehicles were involved in the collision.
