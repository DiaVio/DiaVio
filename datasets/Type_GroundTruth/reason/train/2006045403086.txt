Justification: The Honda Accord (V1) was traveling eastbound and lost control as it exited the second curve, veering out of control and crossing both lanes in a counter-clockwise rotation. As a result, V1 struck the front of the Ford Windstar (V2) with its right side. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 corresponds to a Front-to-Side Collision.
