This is because V1, the Honda Prelude, collided with V2, the International school bus, in the left rear tire of V1. The collision occurred as V1 crossed through the intersection without stopping for the stop sign, while V2 was traveling northbound in lane one. The impact and resulting movement of V1, rotating nearly 180 degrees and coming to rest on a lawn on the northwest side of the roadway, indicate a front-to-side collision.
