This is because the accident involved a single vehicle (V1 - 2000 Toyota Sienna) that left the roadway and struck a traffic sign, a utility pole, and a fence. The occupants of the vehicle, including the driver and passenger, were transported to the hospital. No other vehicles were involved in the collision.
