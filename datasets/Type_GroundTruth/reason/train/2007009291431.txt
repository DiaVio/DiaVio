This is because the crash involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities were mentioned. V1, a 2006 Jeep Commander, veered off the road, hit a signpost, and then a telephone pole before coming to rest. The driver of V1 passed out due to a heart attack or physical impairment, which led to the vehicle leaving the road.
