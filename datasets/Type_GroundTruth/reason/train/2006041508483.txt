This is because V1, the Ford Crown Victoria, attempted to change lanes and collided with V2, the Mercury Mystique, on the left side. V1 then traveled back across lanes and made contact with the right side of V3, the Chevy Malibu, pushing it to the left and causing it to collide with the concrete traffic barrier.
