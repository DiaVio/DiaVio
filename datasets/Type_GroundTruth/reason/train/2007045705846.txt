This is because V1, the Dodge Magnum station wagon, was turning left from the center turn lane and was struck on the right side by V2, the Ducati motorcycle, which was traveling south in lane 1. The impact occurred as V1 was about to clear the southbound lane. This collision involves the front of V2 colliding with the side of V1, similar to a "T-bone" collision.
