This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle one) and there is no mention of any other entities or vehicles being involved in the crash. The accident occurred when the right front tire of Vehicle one blew out, causing it to exit the road and collide with a large, moveable, electronic, flashing arrow sign.
