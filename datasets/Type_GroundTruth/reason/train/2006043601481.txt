This is because V1 (1997 Infiniti QX4) entered the intersection and turned left across the path of V2 (1995 Chrysler Concorde), resulting in a collision between the front of V2 and the right side of V1. Additionally, V3 (2004 Chevrolet Aveo) subsequently struck the undercarriage of V1 as it was overturning in the intersection.
