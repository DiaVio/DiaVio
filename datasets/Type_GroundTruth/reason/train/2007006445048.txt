Justification: The accident involved vehicle one (V1) colliding with the left side of vehicle two (V2) at the intersection. V1 was traveling westbound and V2 was traveling southbound, resulting in a collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2. This matches the description of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
