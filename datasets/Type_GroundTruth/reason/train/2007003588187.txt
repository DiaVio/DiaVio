The Nissan Maxima (V1) lost control and its front impacted an iron fence on the northeast corner of the intersection after a non-contact vehicle attempted to make a left turn in front of it. Although V1 successfully avoided the van, it was unable to avoid the fence, resulting in a collision between the front of V1 and the side of the fence.
