This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. V1 departed the roadway and struck a turn sign and a power pole. The driver reported that her brakes locked up and the car did not slow down, indicating that the accident was caused by driver error (too fast for the curve/turn) and vehicle-related issues (low tread depth on tires and non-working ABS brakes).
