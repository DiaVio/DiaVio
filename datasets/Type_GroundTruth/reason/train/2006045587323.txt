This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities were mentioned in the summary. V1 departed the left side of the road, contacted a fire hydrant, utility pole, and stone landscaping wall before coming to rest partially off the road. No other vehicles were reported to be involved in the accident.
