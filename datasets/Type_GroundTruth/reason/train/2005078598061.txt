This is because vehicle one (V1) was making a left turn and the right side of V1 was impacted by vehicle two (V2), which was traveling east in lane one. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1, resulting in a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another ("T-bone" collision).
