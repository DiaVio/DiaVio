This is because V1 (Buick LeSabre) failed to stop at a stop sign and entered the intersection, and V2 (GMC G-Series Van) contacted V1 on its left front as it traveled through the intersection. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a "T-bone" collision.
