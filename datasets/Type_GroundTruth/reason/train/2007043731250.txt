Justification: V1, the 2002 Volkswagen Jetta, entered the intersection without stopping for its red signal and struck V2, the 1994 Ford Ranger, on its right side. This indicates that the front of V1 (the Volkswagen Jetta) collided with the side of V2 (the Ford Ranger), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
