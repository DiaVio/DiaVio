This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one, a 1995 Ford Explorer) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver of the vehicle turned right at the intersection but departed the left side of the intersecting roadway, resulting in the vehicle colliding with multiple trees and coming to rest in the woods. There was no mention of any other vehicles involved in the collision.
