This is because the accident involves a single vehicle (2005 Toyota Tundra) and there is no mention of any other vehicles being involved. Additionally, the driver of the vehicle had a seizure before the crash, indicating a medical condition that impaired their ability to act, rather than a collision with another vehicle or object.
