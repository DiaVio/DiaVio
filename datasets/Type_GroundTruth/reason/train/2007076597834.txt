This is evident from the description that V2 impacted the rear of V1 while V1 was decelerating to turn right into a driveway. Additionally, V2 under rode V1, causing damage to the front of V2 and pushing V1 across lanes. The critical pre-crash event for V2, the distracted driver looking for a CD, further supports the classification of a Rear-End Collision.
