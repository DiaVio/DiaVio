This is because V1 (Saab 9.5) attempted to make a left turn and was struck by the front of V2 (Mercury Grand Marquis) on the left side. The point of impact and the rotation of both vehicles indicate a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
