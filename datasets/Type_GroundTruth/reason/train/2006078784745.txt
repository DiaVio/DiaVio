Justification: This classification is appropriate because V-2, the Oldsmobile Silhouette Minivan, struck the left side driver door of V-1, the GMC Suburban, as V-1 was making a left turn. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V-2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V-1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
