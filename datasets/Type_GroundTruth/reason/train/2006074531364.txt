The accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. V1 traveled into the left lane, rotated clockwise, and eventually rolled over, resulting in the vehicle coming to rest on its right side. The critical pre-crash event indicates that the driver of V1 was overcompensating, which suggests that the accident was caused by the actions of the driver.
