Justification: Vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection and was struck on its right side by the front of vehicle two (V2). The vehicles then rotated, and the right side of V1 struck the left side of V2. This collision involves the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
