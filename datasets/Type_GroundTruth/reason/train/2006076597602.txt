This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (1997 Toyota pickup) and no other entities. The vehicle failed to complete a left turn at the intersection, ran off the right side of the roadway, struck an embankment, and rolled over onto its left side. The accident was caused by the driver's failure to control the vehicle, driving too fast for the curve/turn, and potentially impaired driving (prior DUI, driving on a suspended license).
