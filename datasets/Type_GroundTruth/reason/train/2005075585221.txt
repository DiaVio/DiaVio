This is because vehicle one (Mazda Protege) was turning right at the intersection and was struck on the front left side by vehicle two (Jeep Grand Cherokee) which was traveling southbound in the right through lane. The front of vehicle one collided with the side of vehicle two, resulting in both vehicles rotating and coming to rest facing northeast.
