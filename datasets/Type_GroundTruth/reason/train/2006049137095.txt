This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was stopped eastbound in lane four, waiting to turn left, and Vehicle 2 (V2) was westbound in lane two. V1 turned left and the front of V1 struck the front of V2. This collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V2) is commonly referred to as a "T-bone" collision, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
