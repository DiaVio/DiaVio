Justification: 
- Vehicle 1 (V1) was turning left from a driveway, and the front of V1 was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), which was traveling eastbound. This collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another is a characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision. 
- Additionally, Vehicle 3 (V3) was following behind V2 and its front also struck the left side of V2, further confirming that the collision involved the front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another.
