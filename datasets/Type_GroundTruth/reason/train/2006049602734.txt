Justification: Vehicle one was attempting to cross the northbound lanes and turn left into the southbound lanes of traffic. Vehicle two, traveling in the third lane, collided with the right side of vehicle one. This aligns with the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
