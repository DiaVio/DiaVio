This is because the collision involved only one vehicle (1998 Honda Civic) and no other entities were mentioned. The driver of the vehicle departed the roadway multiple times, eventually impacting a parked flatbed trailer. The critical reason for the accident was attributed to the driver's poor directional control, indicating that it was a single-vehicle incident.
