This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) struck the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2), which then caused a chain reaction of collisions involving the other vehicles. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to stop in time and hit the vehicle in front. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed," suggesting that V2 was also hit from behind by V1. Therefore, this accident fits the description of a Rear-End Collision. (Type 3)
