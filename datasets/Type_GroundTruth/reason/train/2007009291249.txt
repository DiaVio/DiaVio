Justification: 
- V1 swerved to avoid the carpet and collided with the right rear portion of V2, indicating a collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2.
- V2 then spun 180 degrees clockwise and collided front-to-front with V3. 
- V3, in turn, continued its rotation and was struck on the left side by V4. 

Therefore, the accident involves the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
