Front-to-Side Collision category. V1, the Peterbuilt Truck, was turning left from the southbound lane onto an eastbound roadway, and V2, the Toyota Corolla, traveling northbound on the same roadway, struck V1 on its right side. This collision is commonly known as a "T-bone" collision, where the front of one vehicle collides with the side of another.
