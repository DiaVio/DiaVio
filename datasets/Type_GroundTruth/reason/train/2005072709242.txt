This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) collided with the left side of Vehicle 2 (V2), causing the right side of V1 to collide with the front of Vehicle 3 (V3). This collision occurred when V1 crossed through the intersection against a red light, while V2 was passing through the intersection with the green light. The collision resulted in V2 spinning counter clockwise and its front hitting the left side of V3.
