Based on the given information, the accident can be classified as a Front-to-Side Collision (Type 5). This is because vehicle one (V1) was traveling north and failed to notice the red traffic signal, resulting in a collision with vehicle two (V2) traveling west. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1, which aligns with a front-to-side collision scenario, commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
