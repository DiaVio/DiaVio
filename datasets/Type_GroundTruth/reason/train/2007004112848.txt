This is because V1, the Chevrolet Malibu, was making a left turn at the intersection and V2, the GMC 2500, was traveling straight and attempted to stop to avoid a collision but was unsuccessful. The right front of V1 struck the left front of V2, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another.
