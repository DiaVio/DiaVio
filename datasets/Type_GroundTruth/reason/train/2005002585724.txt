Justification: Vehicle 1 (V1) was stopped at the stop sign and entered the intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2) was approaching the intersection and collided with the right side of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side struck the left side of V2. This indicates that the front of V2 collided with the side of V1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
