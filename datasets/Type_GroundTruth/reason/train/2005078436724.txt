This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) struck the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2) while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction, resulting in damage to V2 and injuries to its driver. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was also coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating," further supporting the classification of a Rear-End Collision.
