This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was stopped facing north at the intersection waiting to turn left, and Vehicle 2 (V2) was northbound in lane two approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. As the light changed, V1 began its left turn at the same moment V2 entered the intersection, resulting in the front of V1 striking the right side of V2.
