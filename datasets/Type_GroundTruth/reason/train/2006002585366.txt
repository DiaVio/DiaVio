This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and no other entities. Vehicle 1 crossed into the southbound lane, off the left side of the roadway, and struck several rocks, a culvert pipe, and a pole with its front. There was no mention of any other vehicle involved in the collision.
