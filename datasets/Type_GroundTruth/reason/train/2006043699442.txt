This is because Vehicle 1 (Volvo station wagon) was traveling south and was struck on its right side by the front of Vehicle 2 (Chrysler hatchback) as it was entering the roadway from a driveway. The collision occurred when the front of Vehicle 2 collided with the side of Vehicle 1, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
