This is because V1, the Chevrolet Lumina, swerved to the left and then back to the right, ultimately colliding with an embankment and a tree on the left side of the vehicle. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of the embankment and the tree, which aligns with a front-to-side collision.
