This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions and overcompensation, resulting in the vehicle skidding and ultimately rolling onto its side.
