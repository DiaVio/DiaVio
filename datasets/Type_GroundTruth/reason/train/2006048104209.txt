This is because Vehicle 2 (V2) struck the right side of Vehicle 1 (V1) as V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. The front of V2 collided with the side of V1, resulting in both vehicles coming to rest in different lanes. This aligns with the characteristics of a Front-to-Side Collision.
