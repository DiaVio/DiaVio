This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle one - V1) and no other entities. V1 departs the roadway multiple times, causing damage to a mailbox assembly, a fence, and finally coming to rest in a field. The accident is primarily attributed to a driver's critical non-performance error due to a diabetic reaction, indicating that the accident was caused by an impairment of the driver's ability to act.
