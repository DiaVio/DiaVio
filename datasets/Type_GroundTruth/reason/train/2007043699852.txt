This is because the crash involved only one vehicle (1999 Cadillac Deville sedan) and there were no other entities involved. The vehicle traveled off the road, impacting an embankment and concrete drainage pipe, and came to rest in the grass median. The driver suffered a stroke and lost consciousness, leading to the loss of control of the vehicle.
