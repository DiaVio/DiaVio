Justification: Vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection without stopping at the stop sign and collided with the tongue of the pup dump trailer being pulled by Vehicle two (V2). The front end of V1 struck the left side of V2 at the driver's door, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) with the side of another vehicle (V2). This aligns with the characteristics of a Front-to-Side Collision.
