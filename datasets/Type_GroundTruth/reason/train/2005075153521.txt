This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The vehicle lost control on the icy road, fishtailed, and ultimately rolled onto its right side. There is no indication of any other vehicles or objects being involved in the collision.
