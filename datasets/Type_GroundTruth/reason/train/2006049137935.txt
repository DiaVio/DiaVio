This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was turning left at the intersection and the front of Vehicle 2 (V2) struck the right side of V1. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V2) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
