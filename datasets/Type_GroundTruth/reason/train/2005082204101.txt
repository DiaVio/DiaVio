This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there is no mention of any other entities being involved. V1 braked with lockup, departed the road, and impacted a traffic sign and a tree, resulting in the vehicle coming to a final rest at the point of impact against the tree. The occupants of V1 also left the scene before EMS or the police arrived.
