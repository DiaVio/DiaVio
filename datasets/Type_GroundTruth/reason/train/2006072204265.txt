This is because it involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the accident. The driver of Vehicle 1 swerved to avoid a non-contact vehicle that entered the intersection against the red light, causing Vehicle 1 to run off the road and strike a concrete pillar.
