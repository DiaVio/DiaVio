This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was making a left turn and was struck on the right side by Vehicle 2 (V2) as it entered the intersection. V1 rotated clockwise and traveled through the intersection, while V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the intersection. This collision involves the front of V2 colliding with the side of V1, which fits the description of a "T-bone" collision.
