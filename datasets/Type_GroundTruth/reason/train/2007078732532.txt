This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection turning left and was struck on the right side by the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). After the impact with V2, V1 then collided back to front with Vehicle 3 (V3). V1 also continued to slide and rotate and eventually collided front to front with Vehicle 4 (V4).
