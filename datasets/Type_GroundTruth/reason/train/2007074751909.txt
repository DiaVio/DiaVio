This is because Vehicle 2 (V2) struck the back of Vehicle 1 (V1), causing V1 to rotate and hit the jersey barrier. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with a higher speed," which indicates that V2 was traveling at a higher speed and collided with V1 from behind. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with a lower steady speed," indicating that V2 was the striking vehicle. Therefore, this aligns with the characteristics of a Rear-End Collision.
