This is because V1, the Chevrolet Suburban, was preparing to turn left at the end of a private drive on the north side of the road, while V2, the Honda Civic, was westbound in the left lane. V1 was struck in the front left corner by the front right of V2, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another ("T-bone" collision).
