This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver of Vehicle 1 lost control on a wet and slushy roadway while traveling too fast for the conditions, resulting in the vehicle rolling over and striking an embankment.
