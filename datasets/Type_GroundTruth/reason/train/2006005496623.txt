This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) attempted to pass the Non-contact Vehicle (NCV) on the right and entered the paved shoulder. As V1 passed the NCV, its right front tire struck the north curb, causing V1 to veer left back into the travel lane. The left front of V1 then struck the right front corner of Vehicle 2 (V2).
