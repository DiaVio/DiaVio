This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there was no mention of any other entities involved. The accident occurred when the left rear tire of Vehicle 1 blew out, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and travel off the right side of the roadway, ultimately striking the ground and a ditch.
