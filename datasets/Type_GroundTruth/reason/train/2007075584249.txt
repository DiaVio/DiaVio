Justification: Vehicle one (V1) struck the back of vehicle two (V2) at a four-legged, traffic signal-controlled intersection. V1 was traveling in lane two and failed to stop in time, resulting in a collision with the rear of V2. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inattention (daydreaming), indicating that the driver of V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead. This corresponds to a Rear-End Collision scenario where the following vehicle fails to maintain a safe distance and collides with the vehicle in front.
