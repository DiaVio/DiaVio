This is because Vehicle 1, the Chevrolet Malibu, was turning left at the intersection and struck Vehicle 2, the Toyota Four Runner, in the left front with its front. Vehicle 2 had entered the intersection while traveling in the second lane on a solid green light when it was struck. The point of impact and the movement of the vehicles indicate a front-to-side collision.
