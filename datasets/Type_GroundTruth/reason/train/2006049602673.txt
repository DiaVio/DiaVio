Vehicle one was crossing the intersection from a driveway and was struck on the left side by vehicle two, which was traveling southbound in the first lane. The impact occurred between the front of vehicle two and the left side of vehicle one. This aligns with the description of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
