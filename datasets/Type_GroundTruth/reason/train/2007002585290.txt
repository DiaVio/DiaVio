Justification: V1 (Chevrolet Lumina) was traveling north on the roadway and V2 (Buick Skylark) was traveling south on the same roadway. V2 stopped and waited to make a left turn, and V1 entered the intersection. V2 initiated the left turn and struck V1 in the front with its front. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 corresponds to a Front-to-Side Collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
