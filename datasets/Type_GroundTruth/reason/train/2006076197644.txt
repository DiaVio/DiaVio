This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. V1 departed the right road edge and collided with a brick pillar, resulting in damage to the vehicle and injury to the occupant. The driver of V1 fled the scene, suggesting that no other vehicle was involved in the accident.
