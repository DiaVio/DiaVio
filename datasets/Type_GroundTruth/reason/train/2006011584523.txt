This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (V1 - a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The vehicle swerved back and forth across the road, departed the roadway, and struck an embankment and a tree, resulting in damage to the vehicle.
