This is because the collision occurred when a wheel from a southbound vehicle became detached and struck a northbound vehicle, causing damage to its windshield and roof. The accident did not involve any other vehicles or entities, and the only reported injury was a complaint of chest pain for the driver of the northbound vehicle.
