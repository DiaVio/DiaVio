A vehicle (Vehicle #2) crossed the lane line and its left front struck the right back of another vehicle (Vehicle #1). This collision occurred when both vehicles were traveling in the same direction, with Vehicle #2 crossing into the adjacent lane, resulting in a collision with the side of Vehicle #1. This is commonly referred to as a "T-bone" collision, which falls under the category of Front-to-Side Collisions.
