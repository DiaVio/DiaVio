The driver of Vehicle #1 swerved to the right to avoid a collision with a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction in her lane, resulting in Vehicle #1 going off the right side of the road and rolling over onto its right side. Although there was no direct contact between the vehicles, the evasive maneuver and subsequent crash align with the characteristics of a front-to-side collision.
