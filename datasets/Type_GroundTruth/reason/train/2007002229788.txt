Justification: Vehicle one (V1) failed to stop at the stop sign and failed to negotiate the turn properly, resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with a guardrail on the north roadside of the intersection. V1 then rolled and struck two trees. This sequence of events indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of the guardrail and trees, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
