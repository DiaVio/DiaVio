This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle #1) and no other entities. Vehicle #1 traveled off the road and collided with a stone pillar, resulting in damage to the vehicle. The driver of Vehicle #1 lost control while negotiating a curve and overcompensated, leading to the vehicle edging off the right side of the road.
