This is because V1 (1992 Mercury Topaz) attempted to make a left-hand turn and was contacted on her left side by the front of V2 (1990 Ford Festiva), which was intending to go straight through the intersection. Both vehicles side-slapped, with the left rear of V1 hitting the right rear of V2. This collision occurred when the front of one vehicle collided with the side of another vehicle, commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
