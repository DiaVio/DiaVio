This is because Vehicle #1 (1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was traveling south and collided with an uninvolved passenger van that entered the intersection from the west and pulled into the path of Vehicle #1. The front of Vehicle #1 collided with the side of the van, resulting in a front-to-side collision.
