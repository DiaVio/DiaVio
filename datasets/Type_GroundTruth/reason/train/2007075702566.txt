Justification: The accident involved only one vehicle (V1), and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the crash. V1 crossed the northbound lane, departed the roadway on the left, and impacted the parked vehicle (V2) with its front. This indicates that V1 was the only vehicle involved in the collision.
