Justification: The accident occurred when V1, which was stopped facing southbound, attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2, which was traveling northbound. As V1 crossed the second northbound lane, the front of V2 struck the right rear of V1. This collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1 corresponds to a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
