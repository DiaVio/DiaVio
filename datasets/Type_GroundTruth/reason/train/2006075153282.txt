This is because vehicle one (1996 Ford Contour) was turning left at the intersection and its front struck the front of vehicle two (1994 Toyota pickup) which was going straight through the intersection. The collision occurred between the front of one vehicle and the side of another, resembling a "T-bone" collision.
