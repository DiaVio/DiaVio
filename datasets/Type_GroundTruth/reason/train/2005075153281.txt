This is because the accident involves only one vehicle, with no mention of any other entities such as objects, persons, or other vehicles being involved in the collision. The driver of the vehicle lost control while traveling too fast for the conditions, resulting in the vehicle leaving the roadway and colliding with trees, a rock, and bushes.
