Justification: V1, the Chevrolet C-10 pick-up truck, was turning left into the northbound lanes when it collided with the left side of V2, the Dodge Intrepid sedan, which was traveling west in lane one. This collision between the front of V1 and the side of V2 is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
