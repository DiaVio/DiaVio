This is because Vehicle 1 (Chevrolet Cavalier) veered left and crossed all southbound lanes, entering the fourth lane where the left side of Vehicle 1 contacted the right side of Vehicle 2 (Lexus ES330). Vehicle 1 was then impacted by the front of Vehicle 3 (Nissan Altima) in the third lane. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (Vehicle 3) colliding with the side of another vehicle (Vehicle 1), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
