This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and no other entities. The vehicle, while attempting to slow down for stopped traffic and experiencing trailer sway, steered off the right side of the roadway and collided with road signs and trees. There is no mention of any other vehicle being involved in the accident.
