This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there was no mention of any other entities, such as another vehicle, object, or pedestrian, being involved in the collision. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and hit the curb, resulting in a blown-out tire and the vehicle coming to rest on the sidewalk.
