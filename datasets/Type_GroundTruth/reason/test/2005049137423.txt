This is because the accident only involved one vehicle (V1) and there was no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn and, due to overcompensation after trying to avoid a collision with another vehicle, the vehicle departed the roadway and struck a retaining wall.
