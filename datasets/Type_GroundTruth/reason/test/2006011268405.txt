This is because the Ford Taurus (V1) swerved to the left onto the paved shoulder to avoid the pick-up truck (witness vehicle) that quickly swerved into lane two to pass the semi. As a result, V1 contacted loose gravel on the shoulder, swerved back right, and ultimately collided with the rumble strips, rotating clockwise and straddling lane one and the shoulder before leaving the roadway and rolling in the grassy median.
