This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was traveling west and intended to make a left turn at the intersection, but crossed the double yellow lane line and its front contacted the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), which was traveling east. The front of V1 collided with the side of V2, resulting in a T-bone collision.
