This is because V1, the Saturn SL2, crossed the double yellow centerline and struck the left side of V2 (the Dodge Ram pickup truck) and then the left side of the trailer towed behind V2. V1 then continued moving and struck the front of V3, the Chrysler Town and Country minivan. The impact between the front of V1 and the side of V2 corresponds to a front-to-side collision.
