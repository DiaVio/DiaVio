This is because vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection and impacted the right side of vehicle two (V2), causing V2 to be deflected to the east. This collision involves the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
