This is based on the description that Vehicle 1 (V1) entered the intersection and turned left, resulting in the front of V1 striking the front of Vehicle 2 (V2). Additionally, V2 then traveled to the southwest and its front struck the left side of Vehicle 3 (V3). This indicates that the front of one vehicle (V1) collided with the side of another (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
