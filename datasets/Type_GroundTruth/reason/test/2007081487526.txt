This is because the accident only involves one vehicle, with no other entities involved. The vehicle lost control, rotated clockwise, and departed the roadway, impacting various objects before coming to rest on its roof. The occupants were ejected from the vehicle, and the registered owner of the vehicle died at the scene.
