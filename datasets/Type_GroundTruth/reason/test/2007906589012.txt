This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (2002 Mitsubishi Lancer) and there is no mention of any other entities involved in the collision. The driver of the Mitsubishi Lancer lost control of the vehicle while trying to avoid a sideswipe from an unknown vehicle, resulting in the vehicle colliding with a light pole and coming to a rest on the side of the road.
