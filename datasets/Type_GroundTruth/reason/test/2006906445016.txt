This is because V1, while trying to avoid striking the vehicle in front of it, partially entered the westbound side of the roadway and sideswiped V2. Additionally, V2 was struck on its right side front by the front left corner of V3. Both of these collisions involve the front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another.
