Justification:
- Vehicle 1 (V1) changed lanes into the second lane, a two-way left turn lane.
- V1 slowed and then turned left into a parking lot.
- The front of Vehicle 2 (V2) impacted with the right of V1.
- Both vehicles rotated and came to rest in the parking lot.

This sequence of events indicates that the front of V2 collided with the side of V1, which is characteristic of a Front-to-Side Collision (T-bone collision).
