This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there was no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or other vehicles) being involved in the collision. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, crossed multiple lanes, and rolled before coming to a rest, indicating that the accident was solely caused by the actions of the driver.
