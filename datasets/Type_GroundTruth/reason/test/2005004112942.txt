This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there were no other entities involved. V1, a 2005 Jeep Liberty SUV, was making a left turn at the intersection and drove up the center median, resulting in the vehicle rolling onto its right side. The driver stated that he hit the concrete divider and lost control of the vehicle.
