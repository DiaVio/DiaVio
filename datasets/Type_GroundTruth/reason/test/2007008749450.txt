This is because V1, the Pontiac Grand Prix, was attempting to turn left into the southbound lanes and was struck by V2, the Ford Taurus, in the left front. V2 was driving north in lane two and V1 pulled out in front of V2 from behind another vehicle on the right side of the road. This collision involves the front of one vehicle (V1) colliding with the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
