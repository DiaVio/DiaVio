The accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and no other entities. V1 lost control, departed the roadway, and rolled over, resulting in injuries to the driver and a passenger. The critical pre-crash event and the critical reason for the event both indicate that the accident was caused by the driver's poor directional control and traveling too fast for the conditions.
