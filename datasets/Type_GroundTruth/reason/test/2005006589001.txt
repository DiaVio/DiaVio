This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) collided with the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2) while both vehicles were on the on-ramp, with V2 stopped and waiting to merge into traffic. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as recognition error inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 had not yet merged into traffic. Additionally, both drivers were distracted and fatigued, which may have contributed to the Rear-End Collision.
