This is because V1 (1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse) was traveling south on the service road and was impacted on the left side by V2 (2003 Chrysler Sebring), which was traveling west. V1 then rotated and impacted the front of V3 (2004 Dodge Neon) on its right side. This sequence of events indicates a collision where the front of one vehicle (V1) collides with the side of another (V2), known as a "T-bone" collision.
