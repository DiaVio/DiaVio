This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) struck the back of Vehicle 2 (V2) while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction and V2 was stopped due to a non-contact vehicle turning at the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," which indicates a Rear-End Collision.
