Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was traveling southbound and turned left to go eastbound at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2) was traveling in the opposite direction and struck V1 in the right side with the front of the vehicle. This collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1 is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
