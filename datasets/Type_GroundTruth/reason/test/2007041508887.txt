Justification: V1, the Lexus SC430, was preparing to enter the north/south roadway from a gas station driveway and crossed over three travel lanes into the path of V2, the Mitsubishi Eclipse. The front of V2 made contact with the left front of V1, resulting in a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1).
