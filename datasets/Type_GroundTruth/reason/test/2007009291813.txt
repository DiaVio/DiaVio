This is because V1, the Ford Explorer, was making a left turn at the intersection and was struck on the right front portion by V2, the Jeep Wrangler, which was traveling in the westbound lane. The impact occurred between the front of V2 and the right front portion of V1, resulting in V1 spinning counterclockwise and the rear corner of V1 striking the left center of V2.
