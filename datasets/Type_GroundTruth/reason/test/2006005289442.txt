This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (2005 Hummer H2) and no other entities were mentioned to be involved in the crash. The driver of the vehicle suffered from a diabetic emergency, which rendered him incapable of driving and resulted in the vehicle swerving off the road and colliding with a utility pole.
