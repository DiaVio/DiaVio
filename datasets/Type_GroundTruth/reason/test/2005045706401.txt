Vehicle 1 hit the back of Vehicle 2 while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction and came to rest a few meters south of the point of impact. The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle 1 was stated as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that Vehicle 2 was stopped or slowing down due to rush hour congestion. The associated factors, such as inadequate surveillance and following too closely, further support the classification of a Rear-End Collision.
