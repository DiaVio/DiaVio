Justification: Vehicle 1 made an illegal maneuver by turning right from the left turn only lane and crossed over three lanes, resulting in Vehicle 2 striking Vehicle 1 on its right side. The collision between the front of Vehicle 2 and the side of Vehicle 1 is a classic example of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
