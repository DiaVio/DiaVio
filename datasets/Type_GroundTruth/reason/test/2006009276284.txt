This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there were no other entities involved. V1 departed the roadway and hit a utility pole on the right roadside, resulting in damage to the vehicle. The driver's internal distraction of drinking while driving and poor directional control were identified as factors contributing to the accident.
