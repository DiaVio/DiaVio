This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (1998 Jeep Cherokee) and no other entities were mentioned to be involved in the collision. The vehicle lost control, traveled off the right side of the road, impacted a guardrail, and rolled over, coming to rest on its top on the right shoulder.
