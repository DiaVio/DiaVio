Justification: The accident involves only one vehicle (Vehicle 1) and there is no mention of any other entities, such as another vehicle, object, or person, being involved in the collision. Vehicle 1 crossed into and over the northbound lanes, struck multiple parked vehicles, and ultimately came to rest on its left side.
