V1, the Toyota Camry, attempted to make a left turn and was struck on its right rear side by V2, the Geo Metro, which was traveling straight through the intersection. After the initial impact, V1's left side made contact with the front of V3, the Lexus RX300. This sequence of events indicates a front-to-side collision.
