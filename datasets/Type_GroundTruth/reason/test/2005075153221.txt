This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) initiated a u-turn from the right shoulder, crossing the highway and colliding with the front of Vehicle 2 (V2) as it was traveling in the eastbound lane. The impact occurred between the front of V2 and the right side of V1, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision.
