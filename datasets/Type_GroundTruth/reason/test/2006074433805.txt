Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was southbound and entered the intersection, while vehicle two (V2) was eastbound and struck the left side of V1. This indicates that the front of V2 collided with the side of V1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
