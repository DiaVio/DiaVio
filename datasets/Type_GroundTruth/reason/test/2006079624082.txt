This is because Vehicle 1 (V1) was traveling west and entered the intersection, and its left plane was struck by the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), which was traveling north. As both vehicles moved together, the front right of Vehicle 3 (V3), which was also traveling north, struck the left side of V2. This collision scenario fits the description of a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
