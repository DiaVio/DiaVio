This is because V2, the Oldsmobile Intrigue, was making a left turn at the intersection and collided with V1, the Ford Ranger, which was going straight through the intersection. The impact occurred between the front left corner of V2 and the front right corner of V1, which is consistent with a front-to-side collision.
