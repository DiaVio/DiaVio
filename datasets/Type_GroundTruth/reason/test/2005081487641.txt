This is because the accident involves only one vehicle (Chevrolet Camaro) and there is no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) involved in the collision. The driver of the Chevrolet Camaro stated that he steered sharply to the left to avoid colliding with a non-contact vehicle, which caused the vehicle to lose control and collide with the barrier.
