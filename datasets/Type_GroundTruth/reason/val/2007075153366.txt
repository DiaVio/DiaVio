This is because the front of Vehicle 2 (V2) struck the right side of Vehicle 1 (V1) as they entered the intersection at the same time. After the initial impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise as V2 rotated clockwise, and the two vehicles impacted again, with the right side of V1 striking the left side of V2. This collision scenario fits the description of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
