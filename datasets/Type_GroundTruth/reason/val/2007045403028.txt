This is because V1, the Mazda M6, was making a left turn across the path of V2, the Plymouth Neon, and V2's front end struck the right rear of V1. Additionally, V1's left rear end then struck the left front of V3, the Chevy Silverado. This collision involves the front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, similar to a "T-bone" collision.
