Other - This accident does not fit into any of the specific classifications mentioned. It involved a single vehicle, but there was an external distraction (non-contact vehicle) that caused the driver to steer right and depart the roadway. The driver then overcorrected and the vehicle rolled over. The unique circumstances and factors involved in this accident make it fall under the "Other" category.
