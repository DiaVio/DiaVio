Justification: V1, the GMC pick-up truck with the trailer, struck the left side of V2, the Dodge Caravan minivan, when the trailer swung into lane one. This collision involved the front of V1 colliding with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision also known as a "T-bone" collision.
