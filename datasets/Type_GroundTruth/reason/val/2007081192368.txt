This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there were no other entities involved in the crash. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions, specifically standing water on the roadway, resulting in the vehicle fishtailing and eventually colliding with a Jersey barrier.
