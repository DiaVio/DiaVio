This is because V1, the 2005 Ford Taurus, was making a right turn from the residential side street onto the arterial road when it was struck on the left side by the front of V2, the 1995 Nissan Altima, which was traveling south on the arterial. This collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1 is a classic example of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
