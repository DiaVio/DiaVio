The description indicates that only one vehicle, V1, was involved in the crash. There is no mention of any other entities, such as another vehicle, object, or person, being involved in the accident. V1 drove off the right side of the roadway, struck the edge of the road, and continued traveling through the foliage before coming to rest. The factors contributing to the crash, such as the driver's physical condition (under the influence of medication and driving with a cast on her left foot) and the road conditions (narrow, winding road without shoulders) all point towards it being a single-vehicle accident.
