This is because V1, the black Mazda 6, entered the intersection on a red signal and collided with the left side of V2, the light blue Hyundai Santa Fe, which was proceeding through the intersection when its traffic signal turned green. The configuration of the impact, with the front of V1 contacting the left side of V2, indicates a front-to-side collision.
