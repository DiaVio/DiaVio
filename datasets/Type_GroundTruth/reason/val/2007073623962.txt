Justification: Vehicle one (V1) was traveling westbound and the front of V1 struck the left side of vehicle two (V2), which was southbound and waiting to turn left. This indicates a collision between the front of one vehicle (V1) and the side of another vehicle (V2), which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision.
