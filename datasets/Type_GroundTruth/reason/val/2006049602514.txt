The accident involved only one vehicle (Vehicle one - a 2004 Ford Focus) and there were no other entities involved. The driver lost control of the vehicle after hitting a puddle of water on the roadway, resulting in the vehicle rotating and striking the median divider before coming to rest on the shoulder.
