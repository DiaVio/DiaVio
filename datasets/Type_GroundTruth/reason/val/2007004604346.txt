This is because V1, the 2003 Chevrolet Impala, was attempting to turn left at the intersection and was struck on the front right corner and right rear quarter panel by V2, the southbound 2004 Chevrolet Suburban. This collision occurred when the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which is characteristic of a "T-bone" collision.
