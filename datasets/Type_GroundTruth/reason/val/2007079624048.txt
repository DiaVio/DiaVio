Vehicle one (V1) struck the back of vehicle two (V2) while traveling southbound. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the parked V2. The distraction of the driver of V1 looking down at a picture further supports the classification as a Rear-End Collision.
