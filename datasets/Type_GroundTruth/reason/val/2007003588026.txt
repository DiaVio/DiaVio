This is because V2, the unknown M/H fuel delivery truck, attempted to make a right turn from lane two while next to V1, the Nissan Pathfinder traveling in lane one. The front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in a collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1).
