Justification:
- Vehicle one impacted with its front to vehicle two's left side, indicating a collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another.
- The description of the vehicles' movements after the impact, with vehicle one rotating counter clockwise and coming to rest facing east in the bike lane, and vehicle two rotating counter clockwise and partially entering the bike lane before entering the left turn lane of westbound travel, further supports a front-to-side collision scenario.
