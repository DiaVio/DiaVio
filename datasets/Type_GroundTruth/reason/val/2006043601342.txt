This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (V1) and there was no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) being involved in the collision. V1 veered off the road, sideswiped a utility pole, drove over a shrub, and came to rest against a tree, indicating that it was a single-vehicle incident.
