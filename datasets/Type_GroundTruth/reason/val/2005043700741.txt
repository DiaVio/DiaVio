This is because the accident involved only one vehicle (1995 Honda Accord sedan) and there was no mention of any other entities (objects, persons, or vehicles) being involved in the collision. The driver of the vehicle lost control while negotiating a left curve, resulting in the vehicle traveling off the roadway and colliding with trees.
