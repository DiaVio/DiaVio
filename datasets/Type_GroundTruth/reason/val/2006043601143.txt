This is because it involved only one vehicle (V1), with no other entities involved. V1 drifted off the right side of the road, re-entered the roadway, and then departed the left side of the road, ultimately rolling over and striking trees. The driver admitted to being distracted by dialing a phone number on his cell phone and overcorrected his steering, leading to the accident.
