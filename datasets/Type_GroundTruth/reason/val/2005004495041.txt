This is because V1, the Ford Escort sedan, made a left turn at the stop sign and the front of V2, the Subaru Legacy sedan, struck the left side of V1 in the westbound lane. This collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1) is commonly referred to as a "T-bone" collision, which falls under the category of a Front-to-Side Collision.
