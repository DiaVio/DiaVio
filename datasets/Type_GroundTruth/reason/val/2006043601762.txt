This is because V1, the 1998 Lincoln Continental, was traveling south in the center-turn lane and turned left across the northbound traffic. V2, the 1997 Honda Accord, was traveling north in lane one when it struck the right side of V1. This collision involves the front of V2 colliding with the side of V1, which fits the definition of a front-to-side collision.
