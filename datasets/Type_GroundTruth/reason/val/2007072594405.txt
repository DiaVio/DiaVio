Justification: Vehicle one (V1) attempted to change lanes to the right and the front struck the left side of Vehicle two (V2). V2 rotated counterclockwise and traveled to the left. The front and right side of V2 struck the jersey barrier divider. This indicates that the front of V1 collided with the side of V2, which aligns with a Front-to-Side Collision.
