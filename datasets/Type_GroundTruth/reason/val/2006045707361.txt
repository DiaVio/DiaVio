The accident involved V1, which was stopped at the stop sign heading northbound, and V2, which was eastbound approaching the intersection. V1 proceeded into the intersection and was struck on the left front by the front of V2 as it passed through the intersection. This collision between the front of one vehicle (V2) and the side of another vehicle (V1) corresponds to a front-to-side collision.
