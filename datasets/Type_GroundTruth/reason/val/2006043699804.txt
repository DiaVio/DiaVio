Justification: The front plane of Vehicle 1 (Toyota Corolla) impacted the left plane of Vehicle 2 (GMC medium/heavy truck) as V2 began accelerating and moving into lane two. This collision between the front of one vehicle and the side of another vehicle corresponds to a front-to-side collision or commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
