Vehicle one (V1) entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck on the left side by the front of vehicle two (V2). The pre-event movement for V1 was coded as going straight, crossing over, passing through the intersection, while the pre-event movement for V2 was coded as going straight, with the associated factor of inadequate surveillance. This aligns with a front of one vehicle colliding with the side of another, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
