Justification: Vehicle #1 (Toyota Echo) was making a left turn from the interstate exit ramp and was struck on its left side by Vehicle #2 (Honda Accord) which was traveling westbound in the left lane of the four-lane road. The point of impact indicates that the front of Vehicle #2 collided with the left side of Vehicle #1, which is characteristic of a front-to-side collision, also known as a "T-bone" collision.
