Justification: The accident occurred when the front of vehicle two (V2) collided with the left side of vehicle one (V1) as V1 was making a u-turn and V2 traveled into the southbound lane. This collision between the front of V2 and the side of V1 corresponds to a front-to-side collision or a "T-bone" collision.
