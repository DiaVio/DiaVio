The accident involves only one vehicle, and there is no mention of any other entities or vehicles involved in the collision. The vehicle, a 1995 Acura Integra, lost control due to wet road conditions and rotated counterclockwise, ultimately contacting the cement barrier multiple times before coming to a rest.
