Justification: Vehicle #1 (1988 Ford Mustang) crossed over the left lane line into the eastbound lane, and Vehicle #2 (1985 Kawasaki motorcycle) returned to its original eastbound lane. The impact occurred with the front of Vehicle #1 and the side of Vehicle #2. This aligns with the definition of a front-to-side collision, commonly known as a "T-bone" collision.
