This single vehicle crash occurred during early evening hours. It was dark (not lighted) along a rural 2-lane, two-way, non-divided, bituminous road with a speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph) with no traffic controls. The road was dry, level, and curves left in the southbound travel direction. There were no adverse atmospheric conditions.

Vehicle one (V1) a 2002 Oldsmobile Alero 4-door sedan, driven by a thirty five (35 ) year old male. V1 was traveling southbound in lane one negotiating a left hand curve when the driver observed a deer run onto the road from the woods on the left. The deer continued on and impacted with V1 on the left side. V1 veered to the right, striking a metal gas vent (post-type), and a tree with the front end before coming to final rest facing south in front of the tree. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical pre-crash event coded object or animal approaching roadway. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). The driver did not see the deer until just before impact. The driver then chose an unsuccessful avoidance action and drove off the right side of the roadway.
