V1, a 2001 Ford Expedition, was traveling southbound on a one lane, one way, wet, highway entrance ramp in daylight conditions. The highway was under construction and the on-ramp was backed up with traffic due to a yield sign at the bottom of the ramp. V2, a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier, was also traveling southbound on the same ramp. V2, was waiting at the bottom of the ramp to merge into traffic. V1 thought that V2 would merge without stopping and as the driver of V2 was looking over her left shoulder to merge, the front of V1 contacted the back of V2. Both vehicles then came to final rest on the right side of the roadway.

The driver of V1 was a 38-year old female who had reported that she had been traveling 2-16 kmph (1-10 mph) prior to the crash. She had no health related problems, and had taken no medication prior to the crash. She was rested and traveling home. She was wearing her prescribed lenses that correct a myopic (near-sighted) condition. She did not sustain any injuries in the crash. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
