The collision occurred at the intersection of three-lane and two-lane two-way roadways, each separated by a double yellow line. The intersection was controlled by traffic signals. Vehicle One (V1- case vehicle), a 2000 four-door Jaguar S-Type, was traveling eastbound and Vehicle Two (V2), a 1993 four-door Ford Explorer, was traveling southbound. The crash occurred when V1 and V2 both entered the intersection and the frontal plane of V2 impacted the left side plane of V1.
