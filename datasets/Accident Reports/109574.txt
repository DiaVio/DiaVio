Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan, minivan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was dark, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1, for an unknown reason, allowed the vehicle to drift to the right. V1 crossed the right lane line, the right paved shoulder, and the right-front wheel scrubbed against and climbed the 10-cm (4-inch) barrier curb. V1 continued traveling in a northerly direction for another 19 meters (62.3 feet) until the right-front bumper struck a 40-cm (15.7 inch) diameter tree that was located 1 meter east of the barrier curb. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 100 degrees and came to rest in the northbound lane facing southeast. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 18-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported to a local hospital. The 17-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center. The 18-year-old male second row-center passenger was not using the available three-point seat belt. He refused medical treatment at the scene and was not transported.
