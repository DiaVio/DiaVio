Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an 81-year old, female driver, of a 2003 Honda Accord, which was involved in a minor frontal impact with the side of building. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of a spring weekday, in the parking lot area of a local municipal building. The parking lot is relatively level with multiple parking spaces adjoining the frontal area of the building. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the bituminous parking lot surface was dry. There is no statutory speed limit for the parking lot. Vehicle 1, the 2003 Honda Accord, was being operated by the 81-year old female driver (case occupant). Vehicle 1 was parked in a parking space facing the building structure and the driver intended to back-out of the parking space and exit the parking lot area. She was reported to be utilizing an available 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle was noted to be equipped with redesigned frontal impact air bags and front, outboard side impact air bags. Crash: While still in the "drive" position, Vehicle 1 was driven forward, jumping a curb and traveling a short distance (over a sidewalk) before striking the building wall with its frontal plane (event 1). Vehicle 1 came to rest at the building wall without further consequence. There were no air bag deployments for this crash. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was found in her respective seating position by local bystanders and responding emergency medical services personnel (EMS). The driver of Vehicle 1 was not transported nor treated for injuries at this time and was transported home subsequent to the crash. However, she later complained of pain and was taken to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a local trauma center and hospitalized with moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was driven from the scene later in the day with only minor scraping to the front bumper fascia.
