This severe frontal crash involved an 18 year old female driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with no air bag deployments. She sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred in darkness (no street lights) and was just west of a curve on a two lane, two way roadway with paved shoulders. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Corolla four door sedan, was westbound and was negotiating a roadway curve to the right. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck, was eastbound going straight and was approaching the curve. V2 departed its lane to the left and fully entered the westbound travel lane. V1 was just completing the curve when the driver saw V2 and began braking and steering right in an attempt to avoid a collision The front left of V1 impacted the front left of V2 in the westbound lane. V1 immediately rotated 180 degrees counterclockwise across the north paved shoulder and came to rest just off the roadway facing east, just north of the point of impact. V2 also began to rotate 180 degrees counterclockwise as it continued east beyond the point of impact. V2 then came to final rest facing west in the eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who is an eighteen year old female. She was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt. V1's frontal steering wheel mounted airbag had not reinstalled from a previous deployment. This driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and was later transferred and hospitalized at a trauma center. Another passenger was seated in the front right position of V1. She was a 21 year old female who was also wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. Her frontal airbag was also not installed after a prior deployment. She sustained injuries and was transported to a local hospital, but her level of treatment is unknown.
