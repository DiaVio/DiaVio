Case vehicle, a 2003 Chevrolet Trail Blazer, was traveling south on a dimly lit rural paved road of coarse asphalt in clear weather. The driver was a 42-year-old female 170 cm (5'7") tall and a weight of 63 kg (140 lbs). The case vehicle was exiting a level sweeping right-hand curve when it departed the roadway to the right onto a narrow grass covered shoulder. Case vehicle traveled approximately 50 m (162 feet) on the grass shoulder before returning to the pavement at which point the case vehicle crossed the road from right to left, departing the roadway to the left onto a narrow grass covered shoulder. Case vehicle then decended approximately 6 meters (20 feet) down an incline before colliding with a Sycamore tree approximately 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter just left of center (Impact #1) . The vehicle's intertia then caused the top of the vehicle's hood to be impacted by the same tree (Impact #2). The vehicle then rotated counter-clockwise, colliding with a second Sycamore tree (Impact #3) approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter with the right rear quarter panel. Upon rebound, from impact #3 the front left quarter pannel was impacted against the original tree of impact (Impact #4) and came to rest against this tree. The case occupant remained in the vehicle for approximately three (3) hours before being found and removed by Emergency Medical Services personnel. The case occupant stated that she was pinned in the vehicle and unable to get out. Inspection of the vehicle revealed that the driver's door was jammed closed due to impact forces but that the remaining three (3) doors functioned in a normal mode. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital where it was determined she had numerous orthopedic injuries. She was then transferred to a Level 1 Trauma Center for further treatment.
