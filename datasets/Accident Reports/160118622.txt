Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2004 Hyundai Tiburon, two-door (case study vehicle). V1 was occupied by a male, age 25 as its driver and lone occupant. V1's occupant was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and the driver side bag deployed. The crash occurred during the hours of darkness. The weather at the time of the crash was clear and dry. The roadway surface was dry. The posted speed limit is 35 mph (56 kmph). The crash occurred on a four lane trafficway. The trafficway travels primarily north and south. The trafficway is divided by a double yellow line but just prior to the crash scene the trafficway is divided by a raised concrete median. The trafficway is level. V1 was traveling southbound in the right through lane. V1 came upon a slowing moving vehicle and V1's driver swerved to the left to avoid this vehicle. V1's driver then overcorrected to the right causing V1 to start a clockwise rotation. V1 continued to skid off the right side of the roadway and struck a fire hydrant with its left side. The case study participant was transported by air to a trauma center.
