This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 16-year-old, female driver with deployed air bags. She sustained serious injuries in a frontal crash with a tree. There was a non-case occupant in the right front passenger seat. She was a 16-year-old female with police-reported incapacitating injuries. The crash occurred late evening in dry, clear weather on an unlighted roadway. A 2010 VW Beetle 2-door hatchback (V1) was negotiating a right curve on a suburban, bituminous, two-lane roadway heading east. The grade was slightly uphill at 3% on approach to a hillcrest where control was lost. As V1 negotiated the right curve, it began a 10 degree clockwise yaw and traveled off the roadway to the left. V1 impacted a railroad tie with its front (Event 1) being used as a landscaping border for a residential yard. V1 continued a short distance before impacting a tree (85 cm diameter) with its front plane (Event 2) and coming to rest against that tree in the northeast roadside. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 16-year-old female case occupant who was restrained by lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The steering wheel and side seatback airbags deployed as a result of impact. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance where she was diagnosed with serious injuries. The 16-year-old female non-case occupant was also restrained by a lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. Her instrument panel airbag deployed, but the side seatback airbag did not deploy on the right side. She was transported to a local trauma center with police-reported incapacitating injuries which were less severe than the driver.
