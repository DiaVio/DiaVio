Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 GMC Savanna, cargo van was also traveling east and was ahead of V1. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V2 observed that the vehicle in front of him was stopped, waiting for traffic to clear, so as to make a left turn and brought his vehicle to a stop behind this non-contact vehicle. The driver of V1 was reportedly confused while attempting to disengage his cruise control system and could not avoid striking V2. The driver of V1 reportedly attempted to avoid V2 by steering right but the front of V1 struck the rear of V2 in an offset manner. The impact caused V2 to move forward and rotate clockwise slightly before coming to rest in the eastbound lane. The impact casued V1 to also rotate clockwise slightly and V1 came to rest on the right (south) shoulder. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 57-year-old male driver of V2 sustained unknown injuries and was transported to local hospital by ground ambulance. The 80-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
