This case involves the unbelted 21-year-old male driver of a pickup responding to a near side impact with a wooden utility pole. The subject sustained serious injury as a result of the 10 o'clock principal direction of force. This single vehicle crash occurred on a five lane, east/west trafficway traveling through a commercial/residential area. There were two lanes for travel in each direction separated by a continuous center turn lane. For westbound travel the roadway curved left with a slight downhill grade. The westbound lanes were bordered to the right (north) by a raised curb gutter and concrete sidewalk. At the crash site there was a fire hydrant and a 2m, block/stucco, wall with iron railing interspersed along its upper half. A stairway led upward from along the wall. There was a 38cm wooden utility located just west of the fire hydrant and wall. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the nighttime (dark, not lit) crash. The case vehicle (2007 Chevrolet Colorado LT, 4-door pickup) was traveling westbound. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts (pretensioner) and first row frontal impact air bags. There were two occupants within the vehicle. Neither the 21-year-old male driver (case subject), nor the 17-year-old male front right seat passenger had been using the belt restraints. The driver had crested a hill and began a downhill grade, with a left curve, on its approach to the crash site. Scene evidence suggests that the vehicle was traveling at a high velocity as it attempted the left curve. The vehicle left the roadway, leaving tire marks, as it struck down a fire hydrant with its front center. The impact sheared the hydrant from its base and water began erupting from the main. Vehicle damage suggests the frontal impact air bags deployed. The vehicle rotated slightly counterclockwise and continued forward across the sidewalk, and struck the concrete block/stucco wall with its front right (extreme offset right) bumper corner. The impact bent the right bumper corner back, and then sheared down the right side causing severe A-pillar, hood and door intrusion on that side. The vehicle came off of the wall in a clockwise rotation and into the 38cm wooden utility pole with its left driver door. The vehicle wrapped around the pole and came to rest adjacent to it, facing east, opposite its original travel direction. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The driver/subject was transported to a trauma facility with serious injuries. The front right seat passenger sustained a fatal head injury and was pronounced at the scene.
