The case vehicle, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta sedan was northbound on a two-lane roadway. It was dark, the weather was clear and the roadway was dry. During the vehicle inspection it was noted that the right-rear tire was bald and worn to the point the steel casing ply cords were visible. As the case vehicle entered a left-sweeping, banked curve with a 3% upgrade the rear wheels lost traction and the vehicle entered a conterclockwise yaw and departed the roadway tangential to the curve. The case vehicle traversed the grassy roadside and went down an embankment and struck a bifurcated tree with 32-cm and 35-cm diameter trunks with its right side. After impact it rotated around the tree clockwise approximately 70 degrees, before coming to rest adjacent to the tree, facing northeast. The restrained 21-year-old male driver and the restrained 22-year-old male right-front passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. The right-front passenger seat mounted torso air bag and the right roof-rail mounted curtain air bag deployed. The driver sustained 'C' injuries per the police was transported to a local hospital. The right-front passenger was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
