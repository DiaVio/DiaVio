This 16 year old female case occupant was the right front passenger of a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a severe, 05 o'clock right side impact (near side), with an utility pole. She was restrained by an available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt and had the benefit of a seat back mounted, side impact torso/hip air bag. The passenger's frontal impact air bag did not deploy for this crash. The case occupant is 147.0 centimeters (58.0 in) in height and weighs 45 kilograms (100 lbs.). At impact with the pole, the case occupant moved right and rearward, in reference to the vehicle, in response to the principal direction of force (PDOF). As she moved right and rearward, it appears that she probably made contact with the right front seat back and the intruding utility pole. As the intruding pole rotated the right front seat left, toward the center of the vehicle, the case occupant loaded on the 3-point lap and shoulder belt and probably contacted the center instrument panel area. The results from the contacts and loading of the restraint were the following: a subarachnoid hemorrhage, multiple cerebral contusions, multiple basilar skull fractures, an atlanto-occipital fracture, an open right mandible fracture, bilateral rib fractures, a right hemothorax, a right lung laceration, a right femur fracture, a pelvic fracture, a diffuse subgaleal hemorrhage, facial lacerations and abrasions, bilateral arm contusions, a back contusion and bilateral knee contusions.
