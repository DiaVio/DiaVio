This case focuses on a restrained 20 year old female driver in a 2013 Kia Soul (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual side outboard seat mounted air bags. The frontal steering mounted airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on a curved, wet, bituminous, two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway following a rain shower. V1's travel lane had a downhill grade. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). The roadway was unlit and dark. V1 was traveling north while negotiating a left hand curve when V1 began to lose traction in the curve. V1 departed the road onto the right roadside. The driver of V1 applied her brakes in an attempt to decelerate; however, this maneuver caused V1 to skid on the wet grass. V1 contacted a small mound of dirt with its undercarriage. This impact caused the vehicle to go airborne. While airborne V1 began to rotate clockwise and roll with its left side leading. As V1 landed it roll was interrupted as its top contacted a large tree. This impact caused the vehicle to continue to rotate clockwise causing its top rear to contact another large tree. V1 faced southeast at final rest while still on its left side after rolling one quarter turn total. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver in V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital following the crash. She was later transferred to a level one trauma center and treated for serious injuries sustained in the crash.
