This single vehicle crash occurred on a 2-lane road in a rural area. The roadway runs north and south with a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph), and there is a slight curve to the left. The conditions this weekend morning were clear, dry and daylight.

V1, a 2002 Ford Mustang 2 door with one passenger, was traveling south when a squirrel ran across the roadway. V1 departed the right side of the roadway and struck a couple of trees with its right and left sides. V1 was towed from scene but the driver was not seriously injured and refused treatment. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.

V1 was driven by an 18-year-old male that was returning home this morning, after spending the night at his friend's house, when he was involved in this crash. He was suppose to call his father the night before and didn't so it was important that he get home this morning. He said he was driving south around 72 kmph (45 mph) when a squirrel ran across the road. He tried to avoid the animal by applying the brakes but he said the steering system immediately locked-up, causing him to drive off the right side of the road. He said he intended to steer left around the squirrel but the car steered right and he could not regain control of the car. His vehicle missed the squirrel but he departed the right side of the road and struck two small trees.

This driver was involved in a crash two weeks ago and only got his car back two days ago. The EDR information for this car could not be downloaded because there was a compatibility issue. A crash history report for this driver discovered that this was his fourth crash in the last nine months.

The Critical Pre Crash Event for this driver was coded: "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side" and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded: driver related "incorrect evasive action" because he should have driven over the squirrel.
