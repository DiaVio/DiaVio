This single vehicle rollover collision occurred on a single one-way off ramp of an interstate highway. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck, was eastbound and was decelerating on this off ramp that had an upgrade and curved to the right. V1 then departed the roadway to the left on to the shoulder and then into a grassy area that was sloped with a down grade. V1 attempted to steer to the right back on to the roadway. V1 then began to rotate clockwise as the left tires appear to have dug into the soft shoulder and grassy slope and V1 then began to rollover to the left. V1 rolled two complete times (eight quarter turns) and came to final rest off the roadway at the bottom of the grassy slope facing south. V1 was disabled and towed from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and no other passengers in V1. The case driver was a 24 year old female and was not wearing the seat belt. The driver had some amount of cargo in the passenger compartment in the adjacent seats. This driver was initially transported with serious injuries to a local hospital before arriving at the CIREN trauma center.
