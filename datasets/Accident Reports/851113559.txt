This crash occurred at night with no street lights on a four lane, two way highway with a speed limit of 60 mph/97kmph. It was snowing and the roadway was icy and snow covered. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Ford Explorer four door compact sport utility was northbound in lane one and the roadway had a steep upgrade. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 GMC Yukon large sport utility vehicle, was southbound in lane two with a steep downgrade when vehicle three (V3), a unknown passenger vehicle, lost control on the snowy roadway in southbound lane one. The left side of V3 then impacted the right side of V2. This forced V2 out of control, and it crossed over into the northbound lanes. The front of V2 impacted head-on into the front of V1. Both vehicles came to rest near the impact location with V2 slightly pushing V1 rearward. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 49 year old female, who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and had a frontal airbag deployment. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center. V1 and V2 were towed and disabled with V3 driven away.
