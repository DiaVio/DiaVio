This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a three-way intersection. There were two each eastbound/westbound lanes intersected by one northbound lane. The east/westbound lanes were non-physically divided; only double yellow lines were used to separate these opposing directions. Movements through the intersection were controlled by standard and overhead signalized traffic control devices. The bituminous covered roadways were dry, level, and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for all directions was 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred on a weekday during the mid-afternoon daylight hours. The roadway was free of any defects and the traffic flow was normal for this roadway.

Vehicle one, a 1998 Nissan Maxima 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound through the intersection when it contacted with its front the right side of vehicle two, a 2006 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan, traveling northbound through the same intersection. After the initial impact, V1 traveled several feet and rotated slightly clockwise and jumped the northwest curb edge and contacted with its left front the corner building wall where it again contacted with its right side the right side of V2 coming to final rest facing northwestward against the wall on top of the curb. Vehicle two, after the initial contact with V1 rotated clockwise 180 degrees and jumped the northwest curb edge and with its back contacted a traffic control device pole detaching it from its base. V then was contacted by V1 right side to right side where it also came to final rest on top of the curb along side V1 facing southward. The damages to both V1 and V2 were severe and both were towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The driver and single occupant of V1, a 39-year old female, said she was traveling westbound just after leaving a business appointment and had driven 4-miles when she approached the intersection, she thought the light was green so she continued driving and hit the police car.

She explained, she didn't think it was her fault; he (police car) was speeding and going too fast, especially for these city streets.
