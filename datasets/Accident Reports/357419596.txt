This case involves an impact between the right side of a minivan and the front of a full size pick-up. The restrained 40-year-old female driver and 17- year-old female right front passenger of the minivan are the case occupants. The case vehicle, a 2011 Dodge Caravan minivan, was northbound on a dry, two-lane asphalt road approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Dodge Ram pick-up, pulling a trailer, was traveling westbound on a dry, two-lane asphalt road approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection it entered the path of V2. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid a collision by steering left. The front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle. After impact, both the case vehicle and V2 entered a clockwise yaw and departed the road off the northwest corner. The left-front of the case vehicle impacted the ground before traveling down an embankment and coming to rest facing northwest. V2 rolled over two-quarter turns and came to rest on the roadside facing northeast. The 40-year-old female driver and the 17-year-old female right-front passenger are both case occupants Both were restrained by a three-point belt and had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact air bags. The right front passenger also had the benefit of deployed seat-back mounted and side-rail curtain air bags. The driver sustained a loss of consciousness and the passenger sustained multiple moderate injuries. Both occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as case occupants.
