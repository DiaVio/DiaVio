This head-on crash involved three children as case occupants: a 10 year old female front right passenger with frontal airbag deployment, a 7 year old male in the second row left seat and a 3 year old male passenger positioned second row right who were all unrestrained. This crash occurred during daylight hours while it was raining with wet roadway conditions on a two lane, two way city street. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 GMC Yukon four door large utility vehicle, was traveling west in the westbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1997 Toyota 4Runner four door compact utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane. V1 was negotiating a curve to the right when it crossed the double yellow lane lines and traveled into the eastbound lane. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2 head-on. From the point of impact V2 was forced backwards while rotating clockwise and came to final rest facing northwest in the westbound travel lane. V1 continued traveling west while also rotating clockwise and came to final rest facing north in the eastbound travel lane. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. There are three case occupants in V1 who were all transported to the trauma center. The first is a 10 year old female front right passenger who was unrestrained with a deployed mid instrument panel mounted front air bag and sustained moderate injuries. The second case occupant is a 7 year old male in the second row left seating area who was unrestrained and sustained moderate injuries. The third case occupant is a 3 year old male in the second row right seating area who was unrestrained and sustained serious injuries. The driver of V1 was an 18 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column air bag deployed and had only minor injuries. No other occupants were in V1.
