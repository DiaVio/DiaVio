This 91-year -old female case occupant was the driver of a 2003 Toyota Prius that was involved in a moderate severe frontal collision with a 2000 Infinity I30t. The case occupant was utilizing the available three-point seatbelt and the available driver's front airbag deployed upon impact. Upon impact the case occupant moved forward and to the right loading her chest with the seatbelt that resulted in the breast contusion, rib fractures and pulmonary contusion. The rib fractures punctured the lung resulting in the pneumothorax. Her forward movement is limited by the lap portion of the seatbelt which caused the abdominal contusions. Moving to the right, her right thigh struck the center console causing the thigh contusion. Her right lower leg struck the center instrument panel that resulted in the calf laceration and shin contusion. The source of her ankle contusion was possibly the toe pan. Her left foot is most likely planted on the toe pan as her body rotated to the right causing an external rotation to her ankle which resulted in the ankle dislocation and bi-malleolar fracture. Her right knee contusion was sustained when she struck the knee bolster. As the case occupant rebound back into the seat, it is possible that her head struck the headrest causing the contusion to the scalp. The source of the hand contusions could not be determined with any degree of certainty and remains unknown. Her age and the resulting loss of bone density contributed to her injuries.
