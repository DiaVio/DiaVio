This near-side impact crash case involves an 81 year old female driver who sustained serious injuries, wearing the available lap/shoulder belt with deployments of the left side impact seatback mounted and left roof side rail curtain air bags. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a four legged intersection with a stop sign present for the north/southbound traffic. These intersecting streets are both two lane, two way asphalt roadways with no curbs. In the area where the crash occurred, there are uphill grades for both northbound and eastbound vehicles. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Honda Accord four door sedan, was traveling north in the northbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2003 Toyota 4Runner four door compact utility vehicle, was traveling east on the intersecting street. Both vehicles entered the intersection, the driver of V2 steered to the left, and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise as V2 rotated counterclockwise and the left side of V1 contacted the right side of V2. As the vehicles traveled in a northeasterly direction, they continued to rotate and the left side of V1 impacted V2's right bumper corner. V1 continued traveling forward and departed the northeast corner of the intersection. The front left of V1 impacted a ditch, resulting in minor damage and then came to final rest facing northeast near the northeast corner. V2 departed the northeast corner and came to final rest facing northeast, with its front end partially in the ditch just north of V1. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 81 year old female driver of V1 who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat back mounted and roof side rail mounted air bags both deployed during the first crash event. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
