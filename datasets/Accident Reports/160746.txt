Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Pontiac Bonneville, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. It was dark, the weather was cloudy, and the asphalt road surface was dry. The driver of V1, while negotiating a right curve, departed the right-side of the road. The driver apparently over-steered back to the left and V1 entered a counterclockwise yaw/rotation. V1 crossed both lanes of the road and departed the left side of the road with the right side leading. The right side of V1 struck a large tree in a residential lawn and came to rest facing south-southeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 35-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
