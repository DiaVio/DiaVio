Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Ranger, 4-door pickup truck was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 became fatigued, fell asleep and relinquished control of his vehicle. V1 drifted to the left, crossed the centerline and westbound lane and departed the left side of the road. V1 entered into a shallow ditch and as V1 traversed a driveway berm, V1 vaulted and came back to ground on the opposite side of this driveway berm with the undercarriage striking the bottom of the ditch. The driver of V1 then awoke and steered left causing a clockwise rotation and V1 tripped over its left side and began to roll across a private parking lot. V1 rolled two quarter turns and came to rest in the parking lot, on its' roof, facing west-southwest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 21-year-old male driver (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries. The 20-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was reportedly seated in an upright manner but asleep at the time of the crash. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
