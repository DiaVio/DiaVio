This case involved a belted male driver responding to a near side (left) non-horizontal impact with side impact air bag(s) deployment

This crash occurred on a southbound entrance/exit connector roadway adjacent to a multi-lane interstate. The two-lane entrance/exit channel was divided from the interstate by a raised, curbed divider and was situated approximately one meter lower than the interstate. The entrance/exit connector ran parallel to the southbound lanes of the interstate. The connector consisted of a single, straight exit lane leading away from the interstate and a sweeping, down grade, right curved entrance lane that adjoined it just north of the point of impact. Once joined, the entrance lane became straight and the connector became two straight lanes of one-way travel. The southbound side of the interstate consisted of four lanes of travel, had a negative grade and a right curve. The weather was clear and the concrete roadways were dry during the midday, weekday crash.

The case vehicle (V1, 2002 BMW 525i, 4-door sedan) was traveling in the entrance lane, downhill and negotiating the sweeping right curve, at an unknown speed. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts (pretensioner equipped), frontal impact driver and passenger air bags, front row door mounted side impact air bags and front row roof rail HPS (tube-shaped) air bags. The 67-year-old, male driver (case subject, sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, which was found impinged by B-pillar deformation spooled out.

The opposing vehicle (V2, 1977 Ford Bronco, utility vehicle, further specifics unknown) was traveling southbound on the interstate in the number one lane (right) at an unknown speed, downhill and negotiating the slight right curve. V2 was occupied solely by the female driver.

V1 had just completed the sweeping curve and had begun to travel straight (southbound) in the number one (right) lane of the connector, adjacent to the interstate. Meanwhile, on the interstate, a truck had reportedly swerved into the number one lane ahead of V2. The driver of V2 braked hard, swerved to the right and lost control. V2 began a clockwise yaw as it traveled off of the right side of the interstate, across the paved shoulder and the raised, curbed divider. The vehicle became airborne as it came off of the divider, striking and landing on V1 with its undercarriage and right side. Essentially, the right side of V2 struck the left side of V1. The non-horizontal impact to V1 deployed the driver's side impact air bags. V1 was deflected to the right, slightly, where it came to rest approximately 37 m south of the point of impact facing southwest next to the embankment. V2 rotated off of V1 counterclockwise, overturned onto its right side and came to rest (on its right) on the west shoulder of the connector, facing north.

Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to 'other visible injury' as rated by police. Apparently, the driver of V2 was not injured.
