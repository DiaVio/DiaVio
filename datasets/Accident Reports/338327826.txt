This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 65-year old, female driver with a deployed airbag. She sustained moderate injuries in a frontal crash with an embankment. The crash occurred mid-morning on wet roads in the rain. A 2007 Chrysler 300C sedan (v1) was traveling southeast approaching a left curve. The roadway was rural, bituminous, two-way, two-lane, with a 3% downhill grade. As v1 approached the left curve, it departed the right side of the roadway and sideswiped a guardrail with its right plane (Event 1). V1 then re-entered the roadway, crossed both lanes, and departed the left side, impacting an embankment with its front plane (Event 2). V1 continued a short distance across a dirt driveway before impacting a wooden gate (Event 3) and another embankment (Event 4) with its front plane. V1 came to rest against the second embankment. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 65-year old female driver who was unrestrained. The retractor pretensioner actuated, locking the belt in the unused position. The steering wheel hub and top right instrument panel airbags deployed. There were no other airbags available. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance where she was diagnosed with moderate injuries and then transferred to a local trauma center.
