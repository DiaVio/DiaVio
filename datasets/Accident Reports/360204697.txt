This case occupant was a 22 year old female in a moderate severity frontal crash who was not belted with a frontal airbag deployment and sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred at a freeway interchange at night with street lights and dry surface conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Dodge Stratus four door sedan was northbound on the freeway and exited to a single lane off ramp at a high rate of speed. V1 departed the ramp to the left over a flat grassy surface and then went down a slight slope where the undercarriage impacted the ground. The front bumper cover dislodged and was run over by V1 and the hood opened and flipped upwards. V1 continued through a level grassy/muddy area into some trees. The left side swiped a branch from one tree that broke off the left mirror and caused minor damage before the front of V1 impacted into a tree causing moderate damage. V1 came to final rest against the tree facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant was a 22 year old female who was not belted and the frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed on impact with the tree. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to the trauma center. No other passengers were in V1.
