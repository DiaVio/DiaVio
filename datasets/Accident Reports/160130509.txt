Vehicle One (V1), a 2004 Ford Explorer SUV, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, dark conditions. V1 approached a left hand curve in the roadway and V1 departed the road to the right where it went up an embankment, rotating 45 degrees clockwise and then rolling over to the left one quarter turn, then striking a utility pole with its top. V1 then rotated 180 degrees counter-clockwise and came to final rest on its left side. The driver of V1 and case study occupant, a 32-year-old female, was wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her left side curtain air bag deploy. The buckle-mounted pretensioner also deployed on the driver side. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
