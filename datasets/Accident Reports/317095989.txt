This case involved a 47 year old restrained female driver of a 2010 Nissan Maxima four door sedan (V1). There were no other vehicles involved in the crash. The driver of V1 was restrained by the manual lap and shoulder belts and a deployed frontal airbag. The seat mounted side impact airbag and side curtain airbag on the right side deployed, but the ones on the driver's side did not deploy. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane dry asphalt roadway. The roadway was level and curved to the left. V1 was traveling west at the posted speed limit of 64 kph (40 mph). V1 departed the right side of the roadway in the curve and traveled approximately 44 meters along the side of the road before striking a culvert headwall and then overturning two quarter turns to final rest on its top parallel to the culvert. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center for treatment of injuries sustained in the crash.
