The crash occurred in the northbound lane of a two-lane roadway divided by double yellow lines. There was one northbound and one southbound lane. This was a left curving bituminous roadway with a 2 percent uphill slope and a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph). The sky was cloudy and the road was damp on this well-traveled road early evening during the mid-week. The traffic was light on this rural roadway.

V1, a 1994 Nissan Maxima four-door sedan, was driven by a 23-year old male traveling with a 20-year old female passenger. He was traveling northbound in lane one, negotiating the left curve when the right front tire went off the right road edge. The driver stated that he didn't have time to steer the vehicle back onto the road before the vehicle struck an object on the right underside of his vehicle, lifting the vehicle into the air, spinning. The vehicle flipped end over end, landing on the top right corner, causing the vehicle to spin counterclockwise two-quarter turns, landing upright, facing south. Both occupants were transported due to injury. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on right side." The Critical Reason was "poor directional control," a performance error. Associated factors include traveling too fast (he admitted to traveling between 40 and 50 mph), conversation with the passenger, low tread on the tires, and the wet road in a dark unlighted rural area.

A witness, traveling northbound about two cars behind V1, stated that the vehicle did not skid but traveled over the right road edge, hit the ditch and flipped.
