This case involves a 27 year old restrained male driver in a 2010 Ford F150 pickup (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual outboard side seat-mounted airbags, and dual side curtains. The frontal driver's airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry, two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway that curved to the left. There were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for the roadway was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was northbound in the north lane while negotiating a left curve when it departed the roadway to the right. The driver of V1 attempted to steer V1 back onto roadway but was unsuccessful. While on the roadside V1 contacted an embankment with its front. V1 continued and traveled up the embankment. Once V1 reached the top of the embankment it rolled over (flipped over) the embankment with its left side leading. V1 came to rest on the roadside in between the embankment and the roadway facing north. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver was transported from the crash scene to a level one trauma center where he received treatment for severe injuries that he sustained.
