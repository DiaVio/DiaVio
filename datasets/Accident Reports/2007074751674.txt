This single vehicle crash occurred on a clear morning during daylight hours. The roadway was a level, asphalt 4-lane, straight undivided roadway with no traffic controls. There was a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Nissan Sentra sedan driven by a seventeen (17) year old female, was traveling north in the second lane going straight. As V1 approached an intersection, another vehicle pulled out from the east to go south. This vehicle passed in front of V1, and the driver of V1 steered to the right into the number one lane in an effort to avoid the non-contact vehicle. After the non-contact vehicle passed by V1, the driver of V1 tried regain control by returning to the second lane, but to no avail. The driver of V1 steered right after returning to the second lane and V1 departed the second lane and crossed over the right lane and off the roadway. V1 then struck a small wall, a fence and a house. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
