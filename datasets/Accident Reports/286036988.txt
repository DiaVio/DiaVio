This case involves a frontal impact resulting in chest and spine injuries to the right front case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was travelling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane two-way roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Toyota 4Runner SUV, was traveling north in the northbound lane towards V1. It was daylight, and the weather was clear. The roadway was snow and ice covered due to a recent severe snowstorm. The posted speed limit at the area of crash was 64 km/h (40 mph). The crash occurred as V1 exited a slight right curve and hit a patch of ice, causing the vehicle to cross the double yellow line into the northbound lane. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2 head-on. After impact, both vehicles rotated slightly to the right before coming to final rest. The 80 year old male driver was restrained by the manual 3-point lap and shoulder belt (pretensioner fired). The steering wheel-mounted frontal airbag and knee bolster airbags deployed for his seating position. He was transported to a local hospital for the treatment of minor injuries then released. The 77 year old female (case occupant) seated in the right front seat was also restrained using her manual 3-point lap and shoulder belt (pretensioner fired). The instrument panel-mounted frontal airbag deployed for her seating position. She was transported to a local hospital and four days later transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment of her severe chest injuries and moderate spine injuries. There were no other occupants in the case vehicle. The driver of V2 was not injured.
