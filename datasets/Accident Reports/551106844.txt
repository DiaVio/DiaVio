This crash occurred at night with no street lights in the area. Subject V1 (vehicle one), a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix SE four door sedan, was westbound on a two lane, two way blacktop country road with a speed limit of 50 mph/80 kmph. V1 came through a curve right in the roadway some distance prior to departing the roadway to the left in a counterclockwise yaw. The right side impacted a sign post and then a small tree both near the B-pillar. V1 continued to slide laterally as the tires gouged into the ditch and rotated the vehicle to its right side to initiate a rollover. The vehicle continued to slide laterally (somewhat above ground) on its right side as the top hood impacted some shrubbery and a small tree. Then V1 impacted a large tree into the top of V1 between the A and B pillars and across the hood laterally. V1 pivoted around the tree and the back right top corner impacted the ground and V1 came back on to the tires facing northbound in the ditch with the headlights facing toward the street. The final rest was noted by police and tow operator. The case occupant, a 25 year old female, was seated in the front right position wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
