This two-vehicle crashed occurred at an intersection during daylight hours while it was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Hyundai Accent 2 door hatchback was eastbound on a two lane, two way street with a stop sign at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup truck pulling a Wells Cargo trailer was northbound in lane two of four lane roadway divided by a curb grassy median with no traffic controls at the intersection. Both vehicle were traveling straight through the intersection when the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. The trailer V2 was pulling then impacted the back right side of V2 and then this trailer continued along the right side of V2 and also impacted the right side of V1. V2 continued north and slightly to the east and came to rest facing north in lane one just north of the intersection. V1 continued to slide laterally post impact and departed the intersection on the northeast corner as the trailer impacted the right side. V1 then straightened out as it departed the road and crossed a side walk and came to rest facing northeast in a level grassy area. Both vehicles were damaged and had to be towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and no other passengers were in V1. This case driver was a 24 year old female who was found not to be wearing a safety belt and the frontal steering column air bag deployed. This subject sustained critical injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center.
