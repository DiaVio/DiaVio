This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 56-year-old female belted driver with deployed frontal airbags. This occupant was driving a large sedan when it was involved in an angled collision to the undercarriage of a large semi-trailer, resulting in severe damage. This occupant sustained moderate injuries in the crash. The crash occurred at dawn on a dry, clear morning. A 2010 Dodge Charger large sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling south on a bituminous, two-lane rural road, negotiating a right curve. The road grade had negligible grade in V1's direction of travel. A 1994 Freightliner heavy truck hauling a trailer loaded with logs (Vehicle 2) was stopped in a driveway facing east. There were no traffic controls. V2 proceeded to turn left across V1's path and into the opposite direction of travel, blocking V1's travel lane with its trailer as it pulled out. V1 braked and steered right in avoidance. The front of V1 impacted the rear axle and undercarriage of V2 (Event 1). V1 was pushed a short distance backwards before coming to rest partially off the west roadside. V2 came to rest at impact. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 continued in service. V1 was driven by a 56-year-old female driver. She was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by 19 cm of payout to the shoulder belt and heavy friction burning to the plastic belt components. The retractor pretensioner did not show evidence of actuating in the crash, despite the right front pretensioner actuating into the unused locked position. The vehicle was not equipped with buckle or anchor pretensioners. The steering wheel hub and top right instrument panel airbags deployed in the crash. The available first row outboard seatback and curtain airbags did not deploy. This occupant refused care at the scene. She was later taken to a local hospital by private vehicle before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of moderate injuries. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
