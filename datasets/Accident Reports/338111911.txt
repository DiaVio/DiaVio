This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 71-year old, female driver with deployed air bags. She sustained critical injuries in a frontal crash with an embankment. The crash occurred late afternoon in dry, clear weather. A 2008 Lincoln Navigator 4-dr. SUV (v1) was parked idling at a gas station lot off an urban thoroughfare facing northwest. The surface was a combination of concrete and bituminous materials. The grade was level. As the driver of v1 attempted to pull up to a gas pump, she lost control of the vehicle. V1 traveled off the west edge of the paved gas station lot, riding over a curb and impacting an embankment with its front plane (Event 1). The right rear tire (Event 2) followed by the left rear tire (Event 3) struck the curb, blowing out both rear tires. V1 then impacted and came to rest against a concrete wall (Event 4). V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 71-year old female case occupant who was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt with a non-actuated buckle pretensioner. The steering wheel, left curtain, and left seat back airbags deployed as a result of impact. This occupant was transported to a local hosptal by ground ambulance before later being moved to a local trauma center. She was diagnosed with critical injuries.
