Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1997 Dodge Caravan, minivan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Ford Super Duty dump truck was stopped facing north in the northbound lane and was ahead of V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V2 had stopped to open a gate on the west side of the road and had left his vehicle running with its four-way emergency flashers activated. The driver of V1 did not recognize that V2 was stopped and the was unable to avoid contact with V2. The front of V1 struck and slightly underrode the rear of V2. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven away. The 48-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. She was transported via ground ambualnce to a local hospital and then transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
