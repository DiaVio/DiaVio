The critical precrash event for V1 was when this vehicle drifted over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason for the critical precrash event was a recognition error; driver inattention. The driver stated that she wasn't thinking straight and was very upset over her mother's illness prior to the crash. (NOTE: In addition to this inattention factor, the driver had a BAC reading of 0.307. She was, therefore grossly intoxicated). There were no other associated factors coded to this driver, however, the driver does work close to 60 hours per week. The driver feels rested when she wakes up in the morning and does not have any pre-existing medical ailments. The driver is familiar with the area.

V2 was driven by a 32-year-old male who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital. He stated that he was traveling eastbound when he saw a white vehicle drift into his lane. The driver of V2 then braked and swerved right to try and avoid the vehicle but was unsuccessful. The driver of V2 was traveling between 66 and 80 kmph (41 and 50 mph) at the time of impact. V2 was towed due to damage.

The critical precrash event for V2 was the other motor vehicle in his lane, traveling in opposite direction. The critical reason for the critical precrash event was not coded to this vehicle. The driver of V2 is on a rotating work schedule but this was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
