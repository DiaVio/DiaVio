The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of an undivided two-lane two-way roadway. The roadway had one parking lane, travel lane, and a bicycle lane in each direction. This was a straight, level, bituminous roadway with a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). It was the late evening hours of a weekday, dark but illuminated by streetlamps, and clear with no adverse conditions.

V1, a 2000 Mercedes-Benz ML320 sport utility vehicle with one occupant, was traveling northbound in lane one. V2, a 2004 Lexus RX330 sport utility vehicle, with one occupant was in the parking lane on the right side of the northbound lane and was attempting to merge into lane one. As V2 began to leave the parking spot, the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2. V1 came to a final rest approximately 10 meters north of the point of impact. V2 came to a final rest near the point of impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1, the Mercedes-Benz ML320, was driven by a 66 year-old male who reported minor injuries and was transported to a medical facility.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "other vehicle encroachment from parking lane." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. The driver had the right of way, and possible associated factors were unknown because no interview was obtained.

V2, the Lexus RX330, was driven by an 18 year-old male who reported no injuries. He stated to the police that V1 was driving fast, and went through the yellow light then struck his vehicle.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on left side of travel lane." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance, based on the statement that the driver gave police. It was believed that the driver saw the light behind him change to yellow and never looked again in his mirror before pulling out. Therefore, he never saw V1 until he was struck. Other possible associated factors were coded unknown because no interview was obtained.
