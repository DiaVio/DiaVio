Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 54-year-old, male driver, of a 2012 Hyundai Sonata 4-door sedan, which was involved in a frontal impact with a pole and a subsequent rollover event. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the post mid-night hours (dark, but street light present), of a summer weekend, on a straight and level, two-lane, east/west roadway. This roadway has a speed limit of 30 mph (48 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2012 Hyundai Sonata 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 54-year-old male driver (case occupant), in the westbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 is believed to have been using a 3-point lap/shoulder restraint. However, the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front outboard position) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling westbound. Crash: As Vehicle 1 traveled west, reportedly a deer ran, in a southerly direction, across the roadway and in front of Vehicle 1. The driver steered right and departed the north edge of the roadway. Vehicle 1 continued on short distance and crossed the entrance area of a private roadway before striking a steel pole with its frontal plane. Subsequent to the pole impact, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and overturned (right side leading). Vehicle 1 rolled four-quarter turns before coming to rest on its wheels, facing a southerly direction. As a result of the pole impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was removed and transported, by land unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to maximum injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
