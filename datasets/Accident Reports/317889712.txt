This case focuses on an unrestrained 36 year old male driver in a 2011 Hyundai Sonata GLS (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual first row side airbags, and dual side curtains. The frontal steering mounted airbag, dual side curtains and dual outboard seat mounted airbags all deployed during the crash. V2, a 2005 Ford F-250 was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry and asphalt, two-way, five lane road with a center two-way left turn lane. There were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). There was a slight uphill grade for the southbound lane. The northbound lane was level. V1 was traveling south in the left southbound lane while negotiating a right curve. V2 was traveling north in the northbound left lane while negotiating a left curve. V1 drifted left and across the center turn lane and into the opposing travel lane. The front of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 under-rode V2 causing V2 to roll with its right side leading. V1 came to rest in the left northbound and center turn lane after rotating counterclockwise. V1 faced southeast at final rest. V2 came to rest on its top in the right northbound lane after rolling two-quarter turns. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was taken from the crash scene to a level one trauma center by ground. There he received treatment for moderate to severe injuries that he sustained in the crash.
