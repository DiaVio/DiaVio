This crash occurred at night with street lights on and clear, dry roadway conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport, was eastbound in lane two of a two way, five lane street with the center lane for left turns only. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix was westbound in lane two which had a slight curve to the right and then V1 had a slight curve to the left. V2 continued straight in the curve and crossed over the left turn lane and entered the opposite lane two. The front of V2 impacted head on with the front of V1. The frontal offset impacts involved more of the front right areas causing both vehicles to rotate clockwise post impact. V2 rotated almost 180 degrees and came to final rest in the center left turn lane just east of the point of impact facing northeast. Case V1 rotated clockwise almost 360 degrees and came to final rest facing northeast in lane one of the eastbound lanes. Both vehicles were disabled and towed. The driver and front right passengers of the case V1 were enrolled as CIREN subjects and no other occupant were in V1. The driver was a 33 year old male who was found to not be wearing a seat belt but the steering column mounted air bag deployed on impact. He received serious injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center. The front right passenger was a 31 year old female who was wearing a lap/shoulder belt and the front instrument panel mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to a hospital.
