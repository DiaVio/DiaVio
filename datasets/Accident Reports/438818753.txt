This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 76-year-old female belted right front passenger with a deployed front airbag. This occupant was riding in a compact utility vehicle when it was involved in a front plane angled collision to a full size sedan. The vehicle sustained moderate damage. This occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred during mid-afternoon hours on a wet road in the rain. A 2013 Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle (Vehicle 1) was traveling north on a two-lane divided road. V1 was negotiating a right curve on the concrete road, which was on a level grade with 10% superelevation in the curve. A 2005 Volvo S80 full size sedan (Vehicle 2) was traveling northwest up an on-ramp approaching the same lanes of travel as V1. V2 was negotiating a right curve which was on a 3% uphill grade with 3% superelevation in the curve. As V2 negotiated the right curve of the on-ramp, it lost control in the wet conditions. V2 began rotating clockwise as it departed the left side of the on-ramp into the grass gore separating the on-ramp from the highway travel lanes. V2 continued across the gore area while rotating and then crossed over both lanes of the roadway V1 was traveling on. After having rotated a complete turn, V2 struck a guardrail with its front (Event 1), which redirected it back into V1's lane of travel. The front of V1 impacted the left rear quarter panel of V2 (Event 2). Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway and were towed due to damage. The case vehicle was occupied by a 76-year-old female right front passenger. She was belted as evidenced by 6 cm of shoulder belt payout and latch plate loading. The retractor pretensioner appeared to be non-actuated, as the retractor was in working order at vehicle inspection. The EDR reported it to be actuated. No buckle or anchor pretensioners were installed. The steering wheel hub and top right instrument panel airbags deployed at impact. The available first row outboard seatback and side curtain airbags were non-deployed. This case occupant was transported to a hospital before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. V1 was driven by a 58-year-old female belted driver. She was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by latch plate loading and an indeterminate amount of belt payout. No pretensioners were actuated for the driver. The driver had the benefit of the steering wheel hub airbag. She was transported to a hospital for treatment of police-reported non-incapacitating injuries.
