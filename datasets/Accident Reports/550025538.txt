The case vehicle, a 2001 Dodge Durango SUV was eastbound in the outside through lane of a six-lane divided highway approaching a controlled intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 2000 Ford F-550 stake truck was southbound on the intersecting four lane roadway. It was light, the weather was clear and the road was dry. As the case vehicle began to pass through the intersection, V2 entered its path and struck it on the left quarter panel. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and depart the roadway at the southeast corner of the intersection. It came to a rest on the roadside facing west, adjacent to the south curb. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and departed the roadway at the south-east corner, but at a point farther south than the case vehicle. V2 struck a traffic control standard, and knocked it over, before it came to a rest adjacent to the east curb. The restrained 32-year-old female driver, the restrained 10-year-old male right-front passenger and the restrained left-third-row male passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. The driver and right-front passenger frontal-impact air bags deployed during the crash. The driver and the right-front passenger were transported to a local hospital with 'C' injuries. The left-third-row male passenger was transported to a level-one trauma center at a children's hospital and was enrolled as a case occupant.
