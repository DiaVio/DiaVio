Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado, 2-door pickup was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the asphalt road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 relinquished control and V1 drifted left, crossed the centerline and northbound lane and departed the left-side of the road. V1 struck a large tree on the side of the road with the left-front bumper corner. V1 came to rest against the tree. V1 was towed due to severe disabling vehicle damage. The 48-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
