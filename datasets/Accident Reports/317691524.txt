This case involves a restrained female driver in a 2011 Kia Sorento (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal, dual side curtains, and dual side airbags. No airbags deployed in the crash. The crash occurred on a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane road during the daylight hours. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). The southbound lane of the roadway curved to the left. There was a drainage ditch adjacent to the southbound lane. There were also three private drives that ran through the ditch that were perpendicular to the roadway. The travel lanes were level. V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane while the driver negotiated a left curve. V1 drifted out of its travel lane to the right onto the right shoulder. The driver steered left in an attempt to maneuver her vehicle back into its travel lane; however, she overcorrected. The driver lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle went left then she steered right which sent V1 back across the southbound lane. The driver steered left again in an attempt to gain control. The steering maneuver caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and off the roadway. V1 skidded while in a counterclockwise yaw and then continued to depart the roadway to the right. V1 traveled along a ditch on the right roadside. As V1 departed the ditch its front contacted the side slope of a private drive. V1 crossed over the private drive and contacted the second private drive with its undercarriage. V1 departed the second private drive and contacted the third private drive with its undercarriage. V1 came to rest in the ditch after crossing the third private drive, facing south. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital; however, she was later taken to a level one trauma center where she received additional treatment for serious injuries sustained in the crash.
