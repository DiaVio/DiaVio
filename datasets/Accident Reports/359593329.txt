This far-side impact and rollover crash case involves a 22 year old female front right passenger, restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, with no air bag deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred in a T-type intersection, with a stop sign present for westbound vehicles. The north-south asphalt roadway is comprised of one northbound, one southbound and one center left-turn only lane. There is a slight downhill grade for northbound vehicles, and then the lanes level out at the intersection. The intersecting roadway is comprised of one eastbound and one westbound lane. At the time of the crash it was daylight with clear weather conditions and dry roadways. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Land Rover Discovery II compact utility vehicle, was stopped at the intersection, facing west, waiting to make a left turn. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2007 Suzuki Grand Vitara compact utility vehicle, was traveling north in lane one on the intersecting roadway. V1 began to turn left as V2 entered the intersection and the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in minor damage. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and rollover one quarter turn to the right, where it came to rest on its right side, facing southeast. During the crash, the case occupant's right arm was partially ejected out of the broken right front glazing area. According to police, the case occupant's right arm was pinned between V1 and the roadway at final rest and several passersby helped lift V1 off of her arm. After the impact, V2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest in the roadway, facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 22 year old female front right passenger in V1 who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. No air bags deployed during the crash. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center, where she was hospitalized for eleven days. The driver of V1 was a 22 year old female, restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt, and was reportedly not injured. The driver and sole occupant of V2 was also not injured in the crash.
