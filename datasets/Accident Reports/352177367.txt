Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 42-year old, female driver, of a 2004 Volvo XC90 compact utility vehicle, which was involved in a head-on frontal impact with a 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight), of a fall weekend, on north/south trafficway. This trafficway is composed of four southbound travel lanes separated from two northbound travel lanes by a grass median. Both north and south roadways are straight and level with a speed limit of 50 mph (80 km/h). At time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. Vehicle 1, the 2004 Volvo XC90 compact utility vehicle, was being operated by the 42-year old female driver (case occupant), in the northbound travel lanes. She intended to continue traveling north. She was not utilizing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with redesigned frontal impact air bags, front outboard side bags and roof side rail curtains. Vehicle 2, a 2008 Dodge Caravan minivan, was in the second southbound travel lane (2nd from the right), approaching the crash area from the north. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling south. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 departed the left side of the northbound roadway and entered the grass median. Vehicle 1 traversed the grass median and entered the southbound travel lanes, heading north. At this time, the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 in a head-on collision. Both vehicles came to rest in the second southbound travel lane with Vehicle 1 facing north and Vehicle 2 facing south. As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1's frontal impact air bags deployed. Post-Crash: Fire/rescue personnel removed the doors and roof of Vehicle 1 and performed a "dash roll-up" in order to extricate the driver. She was transported, by air unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. The driver and right front passenger of Vehicle 2 were transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center. The extent of their injuries and treatment, if any, are unknown. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
