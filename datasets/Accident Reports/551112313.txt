This crash occurred at night with street lights and clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan, was southbound on a two lane, two way overpass ramp that merged into a divided four lane trafficway that curved to the right. The speed limit is posted at 30 mph/48 kmph. The center divider begins as painted lines before becoming a raised curb median. V1 departed lane two into the painted area of the median before the left tire impacted the end of the raised curb median. V1's left tires travelled on the paved curb median as V1 began to rotate clockwise and returned to lane two. V1 continued to yaw clockwise across lane one and departed the roadway to the right, crossed over a side walk and struck a tree into the left side of V1. V1 bowed around the tree and the front of V1 endswiped into the embankment before V1 came to final rest. Four occupants were in V1 and the driver and front right passengers are case occupants. The driver is 24 year old female who was not wearing the seatbelt and the seatback side impact airbag did not deployed. The driver was found partially ejected out the driver window.

This case occupant was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. The vehicle was found to be wrapped around the tree and the emergency crew removed the right side doors to extricate the occupants. The tree had to be cut away and removed from the vehicle before being towed.
