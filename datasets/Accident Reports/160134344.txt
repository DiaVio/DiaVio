This 79-year-old male case occupant was the driver of 2002 Buick Park Avenue that was involved in a moderately severe frontal collision with a 1991 Chevrolet Caprice. The case occupant utilized the available 3-point lap and shoulder seat belt and the steering wheel mounted air bag deployed upon impact. The case occupant is 72 inches (182 cm) tall and weighs 223 lbs (101 kg). The case occupant's seat was found between the middle and most rear track position. Upon impact the case occupant moved forward possibly striking his head on the steering wheel rim through the deployed air bag causing the scalp hematoma, and the contra coup subdural hematoma. Being restrained, the seat belt limits the case occupant's forward movement loading his chest and pelvis, which caused the contusion to the chest and abdominal wall. The sternal and rib fractures would also have been caused by the compression of the shoulder belt on the chest. His hands would have been on the steering wheel which makes it likely that the upper arm contusions were sustained when the air bag deployed. His left arm was flung to the side where it contacted the door causing the abrasions to the wrist. As the case occupant moved forward, his knees contacted the knee bolster, resulting in the contusions to his shin. It was hypothesized that the case occupant could have had his legs/pelvis in an atypical orientation which could have caused the acetabulum and pubic rami fractures, which are more commonly attributed to lateral pelvis loads. As the case occupant rebounds back into the seat, it is possible that he struck his left back on the side of the seat back causing the grade I spleen laceration.
