This case involves a moderate to severe small-overlap frontal impact between a SUV and a passenger car. The case occupant is the 53-year-old male driver of the SUV. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe SUV was westbound on a dry, level, two-lane road approaching an at grade railroad crossing. West of the railroad crossing, the roadway has wide eastbound lanes, but these narrow down to one lane on approach to the crossing. Vehicle two (V2) a 2009, four-door Chevrolet Impala was in the eastbound inside lane on the same road. It was dark and not lighted and clear, but with severe crosswinds. The driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle. V2 crossed the centerline , departed the roadway off the south shoulder, re-entered the roadway, traversed the railroad crossing, entered the westbound lane and the front of V2 struck the left fender of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to depart the roadway off the north shoulder and come to rest facing west. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 70 degrees and came to rest facing north, west of the railroad crossing, straddling the east and west lanes. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 53-year-old male driver and the 48-year-old female right-front passenger were restrained, by three-point belts and the steering-wheel airbag and top instrument-panel mounted air bags deployed. The 12-year-old, female right-rear passenger was restrained by a three-point belt, and the roof side-rail curtain air bag deployed. The driver and right-rear passenger sustained serious injuries. The right-front passenger sustained moderate injuries. All three occupants were transported to a level-one trauma center, and enrolled as case occupants.
