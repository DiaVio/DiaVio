The case involves a 17-year-old, 153 centimeters (60 inches) tall female weighing 51 kilograms (112 pounds) who was the left rear passenger in the case vehicle (2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser) involved in a severe frontal impact (PDOF = 10 degrees) with a 2005 GMC Sierra pick-up truck that overrode the case vehicle following impact. The case occupant was restrained with a lap and shoulder belt. The occupant moved forward and right upon impact, followed by rebound motion rearward and left relative to the vehicle. The case occupant was pronounced dead at the scene due to transection of her brain stem concurrent with a basilar skull fracture that were attributed (confidence = possible) to contact with the C-pillar or left front seat back (confidence = possible). The rib fractures (right 7-11; left3, 5-10), diaphragm rupture, liver laceration and kidney laceration were attributed to seatbelt loading through the thorax (confidence = probable). The left upper arm contusion attributed to contact with the left door (possible), thorax and abdominal contusions attributed to contact with the seatbelt. The thigh contusion was attributed to the front seat back.
