This crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane, two way roadway with a posted speed limit of 35mph/56kmph. The weather was clear and surface conditions were dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Hyundai Accent two door hatch back, was travelling northbound on this roadway that had a small hill and then a slight down grade just before V1 began to rotate slightly counterclockwise out of control. V1 then crossed the centerline and departed the roadway to the left and impacted a light pole on the right side of V1 with a sideswipe type damage and a principal direction of force (PDOF) of 30 degrees. This right side impact deployed the front right seat back side-impact airbag. V1 then began to rotate clockwise after this light pole impact and contacted the front of V1 into some blackberry bushes, then a downed tree limb swiped the roof top before the left side impacted a tree. This side impact into the tree had a PDOF of 320 degrees and deployed the seatback side-impact airbag in the driver's seating postion. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only occupant in the vehicle. This case occupant is a 19 year old male who was wearing a manual lap and shoulder belt with side impact airbag deployment, and the frontal airbag did not deploy. The vehicle was towed and the driver transported to the trauma center.
