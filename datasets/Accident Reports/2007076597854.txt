This two-vehicle crash with fatal injuries occurred on a two-lane asphalt constructed road. This road runs east to west with a right hand curve and a grade of +6 percent for the eastbound travel lane. Each travel lane is bordered with paved shoulders of 0.6 meters (2 feet) width and dirt extended shoulders on both sides. The posted speed is 89 kmph (55 mph) with warning signs prior for the curve prior to this crash area. This crash occurred in the late afternoon with the setting sun directly in the westbound field of view.

Vehicle one (V1) was a 2003 Saturn 4 door sedan driven by an eighteen (18) year old female with one passenger. V1 was eastbound negotiating the right hand curve when for unknown reason it steered right off the right road edge. Once off the road edge, the driver input hard left hand steering which caused V1 to rotate counter-clockwise and cross the centerline impacting the front of Vehicle two (V2). V2 was a 1999 GMC 3/4 ton pick-up driven by a twenty seven (27) year old male. After impact V1 was pushed backwards and off the westbound road edge. Both front row occupants were in use of the lap and shoulder belts and were fatally injured. Both frontal airbags deployed in V1. V1 and V2 were towed for disabling damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.

A witness listed on the police report indicated the driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control prior to the crash. There were no interviews obtained with either driver so known factors are limited.
