Vehicle One (V1), a 1998 Acura 3.5 RL sedan, was traveling west in lane two of a two lane, one way wet roadway under dry, dark conditions. V1 was negotiating a curve to the right and going uphill. For unknown reasons, V1 departed the roadway to the left side where it struck a tree with its extreme left front corner with continuious tree contact down the left side. This impact redirected V1 to the right, back onto the roadway, where it came to final rest in lane two of the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, an 18 year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
