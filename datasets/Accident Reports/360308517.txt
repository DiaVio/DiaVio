This near-side impact crash involves a 90 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with deployed frontal, side, and curtain air bags who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear, dry conditions in a T- intersection with a stop sign present for northbound vehicles. The east-west roadway consists of one east and one westbound lane, with a left turn only lane available at the intersection for westbound vehicles. The north-south roadway consists of one north and one southbound lane. Both roadways are level and comprised of asphalt. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Honda CR-V compact utility vehicle, was in the northbound lane, intending to make a left turn at the intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1986 Toyota Xtracab SR5 compact pickup, was traveling east in lane one on the intersecting street. V1 began to turn left. The driver of V2 braked and steered left but the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1, resulting in the actuation of the case occupant's seat belt retractor and buckle pretensioners and the deployment of her frontal, seatback and curtain air bags. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest on the north side of the intersection, facing west. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest near V1, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the 90 year old female driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the crash, this case occupant's steering wheel mounted, seat back outboard mounted and left roof side rail mounted air bags deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
