The crash occurred on an east/west two-lane, two-way road at a rear driveway to a grocery store parking lot. The roadway was straight and level while the parking lot driveway had a 6.25 percent grade for exiting traffic. Conditions were daylight and dry in the early evening hours on a weekday. The posted speed limit on the east/west road was 48kmph/30mph.

Vehicle#1, a 1987 Nissan Pathfinder, was stopped facing north in the parking lot driveway when a non-contact vehicle passed from its left (west) to right (east). Vehicle #2, a 2005 Dodge Neon, was stopped in the westbound lane waiting for traffic to clear so that its driver could turn left into the parking lot. As soon as the non-contact vehicle had passed, Vehicle #1 proceeded to turn left intending to head west on the road. Vehicle #2 also went ahead with its left turn into the lot and was struck on the left side by the front of Vehicle #1. Both vehicles came to rest within a few meters of impact. Vehicle #1 was driven from the scene and Vehicle #2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 36-year old belted male whose vehicle was not equipped with airbags. He was uninjured in the crash. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as inadequate surveillance. The non-contact vehicle was coded as an external distraction as the driver of V1 was watching it approach from his left, not noticing V2 pull up and stop in front of the driveway.

Vehicle #2 was driven by a 43-year old belted female whose airbags did not deploy. She was listed on the PAR as having possible injuries but was not transported from the scene by EMS. The Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle #2 was other vehicle encroachment: from driveway turning into same direction. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. One associated factor coded to this vehicle was a false assumption, because its driver assumed that the other driver would yield the right of way. The driver was also relatively unfamiliar with the vehicle, indicating that it was a rental that she had picked up the day before.
