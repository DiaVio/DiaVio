This crash occurred on a two way, two lane highway at night with no street lights. The weather was clear with dry roadway conditions and the posted speed limit was 60mph/97kmph. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Volkswagon New Beetle Convertible was travelling northbound and drifted to the right on to the paved shoulder and then returned back into the northbound lane before swerving to the right again. V1 then began to yaw clockwise in the travel lane and departed the roadway to the right over the paved shoulder and a downgraded sand shoulder. V1's yaw marks from the left tires then began to dig into the sand and ended with deep divots becoming the tripping point where V1 started to roll to the left side. Some evidence of gouges and a dent in the ground occurred from the left side of the vehicle contacting the ground. Then as V1 rolled to the roof the right side roof rail and right door window sill area contacted a light pole with a minor impact. The front of V1 swiped some tree branches at this point also. The shape of the V1's roof top then allowed V1 to roll back on to the left side at final rest after the light pole impact. The vehicle was towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who was a 22 year old female and was found to be not restrained and the seat back side-impact airbag deployed in this position. No other air bags deployed. The driver appeared to be partially ejected with the upper body out the driver window when the vehicle rolled on the left side. Both of the front seat belt prentensioners did fire apparently from the rollover event. No other occupants were in V1. With V1 being a convertible the two second seat head restraints activated vertically due to the rollover event. The driver was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center.
