The crash occurred on an east/west urban four-lane road with left turn lanes divided by a median and crossover. There were two lane entrance/exits to private parking lots located on the north and south side of the road that had stop signs. The arterial four lane level road curved to the south just east of impact with a radius of curvature of 312.5m. Conditions were daylight, sunny and dry on a weekday afternoon. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph).

Vehicle #1 was a 1998 Ford Taurus attempting to cross from the private drive on the south side of the road to the private drive on the north side. Vehicle #2, a 1996 Ford Explorer, was westbound in the right lane of the four-lane road. The right side of the Taurus (V1) was struck by the front of the Explorer (V2). A minor secondary side slap impact also occurred with the right side of Vehicle #1 and the left side of Vehicle #2 colliding. After impact Vehicle #1 went across the curb and sidewalk and into a parking lot off the northwest corner of the intersection where it struck the front of Vehicle #3, an unoccupied, legally parked 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier. The Taurus (V1) came to rest straddling the parking lot curb and a grassy area, facing west 22m northwest of impact. Vehicle #2 came to rest facing north in the parking lot off the northwest corner of the intersection 21m northwest of impact. All vehicles involved were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 26-year-old female that was belted with no frontal airbag deployment. Neither she nor a 20-year-old male passenger were injured. The occupants of the Taurus did not speak English and were unable to communicate with police, ems, or researcher. Attempts at a follow up interview by a Spanish-speaking researcher from a different site were unsuccessful.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was this vehicle passing through intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a decision error, misjudgment of gap or other's speed. Although no interview was obtained due to the language barrier researcher is confident that the driver misjudged the velocity of the other vehicle. Associated factors are unknown.

Vehicle #2 was operated by a 44-year-old male that was belted with deployed frontal airbag. He was not injured in the crash. In the interview he stated that he was traveling in the right lane at approximately 80 kmph (50 mph), 16 kmph (10 mph) over the speed limit. His view was also obstructed due to a pickup truck traveling in the left lane just in front of his vehicle. He stated that he actually hit his brakes before he saw Vehicle #1 because the non-contact pickup truck traveling beside him braked suddenly to avoid striking the Taurus (V1).

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was other vehicle encroaching from driveway across path. The Critical Reason for the Critical event was no coded to this vehicle. Two associated factors were coded to the driver of Vehicle #2 - a vehicle sight line restriction and excess speed. As per the interview, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he was traveling at 50 mph prior to the crash. The posted speed limit was 40 mph.
