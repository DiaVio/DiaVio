This case involves a moderate to severe, left, nearside impact to a passenger car by the front of a pick-up truck. The case occupant is the 64-year-old male driver of the passenger car. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and no side-impact air bags were available. The case vehicle, a 2006 four-door Ford Focus was southbound on a dry, two-lane, asphalt road approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 2000 Chevrolet 1500 4x2 pick-up was westbound on the intersecting road. It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle was traversing the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle. V2 entered a counterclockwise yaw, rotated approximately 170 degrees and came to rest, west of the intersection, facing east-southeast in the eastbound travel lane. The case vehicle entered a clockwise yaw, departed the roadway at the southwest corner of the intersection and came to rest on the roadside facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 64-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was restrained by a three-point belt and no side-impact air bags were available. He was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
