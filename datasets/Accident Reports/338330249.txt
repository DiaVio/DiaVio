This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 51-year old, female passenger with a non-deployed airbag. She sustained serious injuries in a frontal crash with the ground. The crash occurred mid-evening on an icy road in sleeting conditions. A 2006 Chevrolet Trailblazer utility vehicle (v1) was traveling north after negotiating a right curve. The roadway was rural, bituminous, two-way, two-lane, and on a 1% downhill grade. After v1 successfully negotiated the right curve, it departed the right side of the roadway. V1 traveled approximately 25 meters on the shoulder before descending an embankment. V1 struck a wooden fence post with its front plane (Event 1) followed by the ground at the bottom of the embankment (Event 2). V1 came to rest a short distance from impact and was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 59-year old male driver (non-case occupant) who was unrestrained. His buckle pretensioner did not actuate and the frontal airbag did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance with unknown injuries. V1 was also occupied by a 51-year old female right front passenger (case occupant) who was unrestrained. Her buckle pretensioner did not actuate and the right instrument panel airbag did not deploy. No other airbags were available. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance and then transferred by air to a trauma center. She was diagnosed with serious injuries.
