The crash occurred in the intersection of the southbound lanes of a four-lane roadway and the eastbound lanes four-lane roadway. Both roadways were divided by a grassy median and there were two lanes in each direction on each roadway. The southbound lanes were asphalt, dry and level with a 1114m radius of curvature to the left. The eastbound lanes were asphalt, straight, dry and level. The posted speed limit was 72kph (45mph). Traffic was moderate and the intersection was controlled by over-hanging stop and go signals without pedestrian control. The weather was clear and dry.

V1, a 1995 Honda Accord four-door with one occupant was eastbound in lane two. V1, a 1988 Mazda B2200 pickup truck with two occupants was southbound in lane one. V1 had stopped at the red light at the intersection and turned right into the path of V2 which had a green light and was going straight through the intersection. V2 was unable to stop to avoid hitting V1. The front right of V2 struck the left side of V1 near the A pillar (Event 1). V2 then rotated slightly in a counterclockwise direction as V1 rotated in a clockwise direction. As a result of the rotations, the left rear of V1 side-slapped the right side of V2 (Event 2). V2 came to rest diagonally across lane 2 about 9m south of the point of impact facing south. V1 continued traveling southbound approximately 270m, out of control without any further harmful events. It came to rest on the far right shoulder of the next intersection still facing south. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1, the Honda Accord, was driven by a 78-year old female who received non-incapacitating injuries and was transported to a hospital. The driver advised that she was on her way home from a shopping excursion. She reported that she had stopped at the red light at the intersection for 5-10 seconds. She said she saw other vehicles in lane one turning right on the red light. She said she looked to her left and saw several vehicles approaching. She thought she had enough time so she did start to turn right. The driver advised that before she could complete the turn V2 struck the left side of her vehicle.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling turning right at intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was driver related misjudgment of the gap and speed of the other vehicle. The driver admitted seeing the other vehicles coming and that she turned anyway because she though she could make it. An associated factor of driver decision misjudged both gap and speed of vehicle approaching from the left was assigned to V1. It should also be noted that the driver denied any existing health conditions but said she was taking medications normally prescribed for various health conditions.

V2, the Mazda B2200, was driven by a 76-year old male who along with his passenger received non-incapacitating injuries and was transported to a hospital. At the time of the interview, the driver appeared to be very confused about the events of the crash. The driver told the researcher that he was stopped behind several other cars in lane one at the red light. He said V1 came from his right and stuck the right side of his vehicle while he was still stopped. The researcher even asked the question several times in different ways but the driver insisted he was stopped at the time of impact. This does not match the evidence or the scene.
