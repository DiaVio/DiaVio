This frontal crash case involves a 19 year old female, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early, pre-dawn hours, in darkness, under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Dodge Neon four door sedan, was westbound on a two lane, two way asphalt roadway with no curbs or shoulders. In V1's precrash area the westbound lane curves to the left and has an uphill grade. V1 was negotiating the left curve when the driver departed the roadway to the right. V1 continued in a westerly direction and the front of V1 impacted a wire fence, resulting in minor vehicle damage. V1 continued a short distance and its front right impacted a tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag. V1 rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise and came to final rest near the tree, facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 19 year old female, who was not restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
