This case involves an unrestrained 42 year old female driver in a 2014 Honda CIVIC Si (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The driver's steering wheel mounted airbag, left side curtain, and left seat-mounted side airbag all deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours, on a two-way, two-lane, curved asphalt roadway. The posted speed limit was 35 mph (56 kph). The westbound lane had a slight downhill grade. V1 was traveling west in the westbound lane while negotiating a left-hand curve. The driver of V1 noticed a deer in her travel lane. She steered right in an attempt to avoid a collision with the animal. V1 departed the roadway to the right where it contacted an 11cm diameter tree with its front right corner. V1 continued a short distance and contacted a second tree (28cm diameter) with its front. V1 rotated counterclockwise and contacted the first tree a second time with its right side. V1 came to rest on the roadside facing west. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported from the crash scene by ground to a level one trauma center where she received treatment for moderate and severe injuries that she sustained in the crash.
