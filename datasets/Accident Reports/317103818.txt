This case involved the unrestrained 35 year old male driver of a 2008 Pontiac G6 four door sedan (V1). The steering wheel mounted frontal airbag deployed in the crash. The vehicle was equipped with side impact airbags that were not deployed. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane residential street. The dry asphalt roadway was straight and level and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 32 kph (20 mph). V1 was traveling east at an unknown speed approaching a four leg intersection. The roadway was uncontrolled for the east/west traffic and had stop signs on the north/south portion of the intersection. V1 travelled off the right side of the road and impacted two wooden utility poles. V1's frontal plane struck the first pole, breaking it into, while the right side of the front bumper impacted the second pole. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 45 degrees and came to rest just forward of the poles. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment.
