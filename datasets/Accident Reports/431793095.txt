This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 70 year old female driver of a 2006 Honda Element LX all-wheel drive sport utility. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags and seat back mounted side air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver and front right passenger frontal air bags deployed as a result of a moderate severity offset frontal collision with a large diameter tree (event 1). The crash occurred off the north pavement edge of an east/west 4-lane divided state trafficway. The asphalt surfaced trafficway was bordered by large wooded areas, divided by a grass median, and curved left (with an uphill grade) for westbound vehicles. Just east of the crash site, the roadways were straight and intersected with local connectors which were controlled by stop signs for north/south (turning) vehicles. The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 60 mph (97 km/h). It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 1 was initially westbound in the outboard travel lane and proceeding straight. As the case vehicle entered a left curve, it continued a westerly trajectory in a forward tracking mode onto the north shoulder. Vehicle 1 traversed a connecting roadway and subsequently departed the west road edge into a wooded area. At this point, driver steering inputs, possibly an avoidance maneuver attempted upon recognition of the impending harmful event, re-directed the vehicle to the northwest towards a stand of trees. At this point due to V1's high speed, steering input (clockwise) and negative slope (off road edge) V1 began to yaw in a clockwise rotation just before impact #1. The left side of Vehicle 1 impacted a large tree resulting in moderate damage (event #1). The vehicle's front bumper (center) then struck an adjacent small diameter tree, which resulted in moderate damage (event 2). As Vehicle 1 began to rotate (counterclockwise), the front left bumper impacted a large diameter tree resulting in moderate damage (event #3). V1 then traveled to its final resting position (off the north road edge of the westbound roadway) facing north. The restrained 70 year old female driver of the 2006 Honda Element sport utility was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-forward track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the available driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. Following the collision, the driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injury. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
