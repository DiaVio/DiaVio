This case involves a 'T'-type side impact to the left side of a passenger car by the front of another passenger car. The restrained 53-year-old male driver is the case occupant. No side-impact airbag was available. The case vehicle, a 2001, four-door Mercury Sable was southbound in the left-turn lane of a dry, level, five-lane, concrete road approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 two-door Pontiac Grand AM was westbound in the left-turn lane of a seven-lane traffic-way approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. The case vehicle made a left turn through the intersection and crossed the path of V2 as it was making a left turn. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle. Both vehicles entered a counterclockwise rotation and came to rest in the intersection facing northeast. The restrained 53-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He sustained multiple moderate injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center, where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
