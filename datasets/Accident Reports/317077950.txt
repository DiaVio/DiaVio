This case involves a 50 year old female driver in a 2005 Ford Escape sports utility vehicle (V1) who was restrained using a 3-point lap and shoulder seatbelt. The frontal steering wheel airbag deployed during the crash. There were no other occupants in the vehicle and the passenger side airbag located in the mid instrument panel did not deploy. V1 was involved in a frontal impact with the right side of a 2008 Chevrolet Colorado pickup (V2). The crash occurred at the intersection of a multi-lane divided trafficway and a two-lane roadway during daylight hours. The asphalt roadways were dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. V1 was traveling east in the right lane of three lanes with a 3% uphill grade. There were no traffic controls for these lanes. V2 was traveling south on the two-lane road with a positive grade. This roadway was controlled by a stop sign for the north and south travel lanes. V1 was approaching the intersection in an attempt to crossover. V2 had traveled across the westbound lanes and the median and was attempting to travel across the eastbound lanes. The front of V1 contacted right front of V2. After impact, V1 rotated clockwise and V2 began to rotate in a counterclockwise direction. The rotation of both vehicles caused the right side of V2 to impact the left side of V1. V2 continued in a counterclockwise rotation and came to rest in the middle of the crossover area. V1 continued in a southeastern direction for about 19 meters striking an embankment with its right side before coming to rest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver (case subject) was transported by ground to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center due to serious injuries. There she was treated for injuries that she sustained in the crash.
