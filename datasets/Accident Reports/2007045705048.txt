The crash occurred on an interstate off ramp (one way) that ran south to a secondary arterial road. The ramp had one lane that was straight and then the lane split into a straight/left turn lane and a lane that curved right (curved west/right). The ramp intersected the arterial at an intersection controlled by traffic control lights with no pedestrian signals. The ramp's speed limit was 48 kmph/30 mph. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry in the afternoon on a weekday.

V1 was a 2005 Buick Century 4-door sedan that was traveling south on the ramp intending to turn right (west) when it rear-ended V2, a 1995 Jeep Cherokee utility vehicle that was stopped at the foot of the ramp in the right turn lane. V2 was stopped at a red light. Both vehicles came to rest within a meter or so of impact. V2 was driven away and V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 was driven by a sixty-one year old belted female who was not injured in the crash. She said she was chatting with her ninety-one year old mother who was also belted and sitting in the right front position. They were stopping to get a bite to eat and were about three-fourths of the way to their long weekend destination.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was other vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was a false assumption that V2 was going to proceed with merging into westbound traffic. The driver of V1 reported that she saw V2 but thought that it was slowing down and still in motion. She was also looking to her left and rearward to monitor approaching (westbound) traffic on the secondary arterial to assist her merging. Although the driver drives this particular road rarely now, she is originally from the area and stated that she knew this particular location very well.

V2 was driven by a forty-five year old belted female who was transported to an area hospital from the scene via EMS with a police coded incapacitating injury. She was on her way to the store to pick up dinner after a day of shopping at the time of the crash.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was other vehicle in lane going the same direction with a higher speed. The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. The driver was taking medications for hypertension, asthma, and allergies. She had only driven this vehicle approximately 6-10 times before but stated that she felt comfortable driving it. No other associated factors were coded to this driver.
