This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 73 year old male driver and restrained 73 year old female front right passenger of a 2006 Buick Lucerne CXL Limited 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags/seat back mounted side air bags (for the driver and front right passenger positions), and curtain air bags (for all outboard seating positions). The driver/passenger frontal air bags, left curtain air bag, and left front side air bag deployed during a multi-event crash envelope. Vehicle 1 sustained severe frontal damage as a result of an oblique angled collision with a 2000 Hyundai Elantra GLS 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). The crash occurred on a 5-lane north/south urban trafficway. The asphalt surfaced trafficway was divided by a raised curb grass median, which curved right (with a positive grade) for northbound vehicles. The posted speed limit in the vicinity of the crash site was 55 mph (89 km/h). It was daylight; with rainy weather conditions the roads were wet. Vehicle 1 was northbound on the inboard travel lane and negotiating a right curve on an uphill slope. Vehicle 2 was southbound on the inboard travel lane and negotiating a left curve on a downhill slope. Vehicle 2 broke traction on the wet road surface and began to rotate counterclockwise towards the center median. Vehicle 2 traversed the center median and entered the northbound roadway, across the path of the northbound Buick. As Vehicle 2 crossed the northbound (inboard) travel lane, the right front side surface was impacted by the front left area of Vehicle 1 (event 1). The impact resulted in severe damage to Vehicle 1, and compounded Vehicle 2's counterclockwise rotation into subsequent events. The right rear side surface of Vehicle 2 subsequently struck the left side surface of Vehicle 1 in a "sideslap" configuration (event 2). This secondary impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 was re-directed towards the northeast, where it departed the east pavement edge and entered a roadside drainage ditch. The right front wheel struck the concrete portion of the ditch resulting in moderate damage (event 3). Vehicle 1 came to rest in close proximity to the ditch impact (on the east shoulder of the northbound roadway) facing southwest. At this point, Vehicle 2 was re-directed to the southwest, back across the center median towards the southbound roadway. Vehicle 2 entered the southbound (inboard) travel lane across the path of Vehicle 3, a 2005 Ford F-250 4x4 pickup truck. The right front side surface of Vehicle 2 was impacted by the front left area of Vehicle 3 (event 4). A fifth event soon followed as Vehicle 2 then entered the southbound (outboard) lane across the path of Vehicle 4, a 2001 Ford F-150 4x2 pickup truck. The front right area of Vehicle 2 struck the left rear side surface of Vehicle 4. Vehicle 2 came to rest straddling the east pavement edge of the southbound roadway (i.e. west curbline of the center median) facing southeast. Vehicles 3 and 4 were driven to a final rest position along the west shoulder of the southbound roadway facing south. Following the collision, the restrained 73 year old occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported via ground to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage, as Vehicles 3 and 4 were reportedly driven from the scene.
