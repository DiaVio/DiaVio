The case vehicle, a 2004 Nissan Sentra sedan, was southbound on a two-lane residential street approaching an uncontrolled intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. The roadway was wet from a recent rain. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier, was eastbound approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection it crossed the path of V2. V2 struck the right fender of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to veer left and depart the roadway off of the southeast corner of the intersection, before it came to a rest in a private lawn. V2 rotated clockwise before it came to rest at the SW corner of the intersection. The driver and right-front passenger frontal air bags and the right-front passenger side air bag of the case vehicle were deployed. The case occupant is the 37-year-old unrestrained female driver. The case occupant was transported to a level-one trauma center. The 13-year-old unrestrained male right-front passenger sustained 'B' injuries and was treated and released at a local hospital.
