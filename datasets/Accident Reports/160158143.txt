The focus of this case is on a 22-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse (V1), involved in a side impact with a tree. This single vehicle collision occurred during the morning hours (daylight), of an autumn weekday (Tuesday), on a straight level section of a eight lane divided trafficway with four lanes in each direction. This bituminous trafficway runs east and west. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for the east/west trafficway is 112 km/h (70 mph). The 22-year old female driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the far right travel lane of the easbound roadway. She was wearing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had the benefit of a side thorax-pelvic air bag and a side curtain air bag. For unknown reasons, V1 departed the far right eastbound travel lane to the right. After departing the roadway V1 began a clockwise yaw in the grassy shoulder until contacting a large tree with the side plane of V1 and came to rest against the tree pointed in a southerly direction. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by air rescue, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
