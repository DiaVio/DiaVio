The 2-car crash occurred in the westbound lane of a straight, level, bituminous, 2 lane, and 2-way roadway in front of a private residence driveway. At the time of the late afternoon, weekday crash, it was daylight and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55mph).

V1, a 1997 Ford Thunderbird solely occupied by a 23 year-old male driver, was eastbound, in the eastbound lane rounding a curve left, approaching the straight roadway described above. V2, a 1997 full sized customized Chevrolet van occupied by a 43 year-old female driver and her three children, were pulled over and stopped, parallel to the eastbound lane, across a private residence driveway on the south side of the roadway described above so the driver could look at a horse-drawn carriage for sale on the north side of the road. As the driver of v1 came around the curve, he saw 2 other eastbound vehicles pass v2 on the left. As he approached v2 he crossed over into the westbound lane to pass v1 also. Just before v1 crossed the centerline, v2 accelerated eastbound into lane 1 and then decided to turn left (north) into the private residence driveway of the people selling the carriage. V1, already going straight east in the westbound lane, braked but could not avoid contacting the left rear of v2. V2 then rotated counterclockwise and rolled right Â¼ turn onto its right side. V2 came to rest lying on its right side facing west-northwest. V1 came to rest in the westbound lane facing east-southeast. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of v1 stated that he was going home from work going about 50mph on a road that he travels daily when he saw the 2 cars up ahead of him pass a van pulled over on the right. He started to pass the van also when the van suddenly started up and then turned left in front of him. He said that there was no turn signal from v2.

The Critical pre-crash event for v1 was "Other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane over left lane line." The Critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle. Some contributing factors on the part of v1 include the driver's false assumption that v2 would stay on the side of the road and not realizing that caution was required. Also, the driver said he was not in a hurry but he was going to have to work a second job later and had work 70 hours in the past 7 days between 2 jobs.

The driver of v2 stated that she had pulled over across the end of a private driveway facing eastbound to look across the road (north) at a buggy/wagon for sale. She said 2 eastbound cars passed her and she looked ahead (for oncoming westbound traffic) and it was clear so she pulled forward and attempted to turn left into a private drive to inquire about the wagon. She said she never saw v1 and she did not use her turn signal.

The Critical pre-crash event for v2 was "turning left at intersection". The Critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was inadequate surveillance. Some contributing factors on the part of v2 include the decision to turn without signaling, failure to look rearward/inadequate surveillance and the driver's being distracted while concentrating on the wagon for sale along the road.
