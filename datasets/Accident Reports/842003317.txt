This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 42 year old female driver of a 2000 Toyota RAV4 4x4 4-door sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2006 BMW 530i 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on an unmarked two lane rural roadway and traveling downhill (after a hillcrest). Vehicle 2 was southbound on the same roadway and traveling uphill (after a sag area). The driver of Vehicle 2 allowed the vehicle to enter the northbound lane, and across the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the northbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage. At this point, both vehicles rotated counterclockwise to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest off the east pavement edge facing southeast. Vehicle 2 came to rest along the west pavement edge facing northeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
