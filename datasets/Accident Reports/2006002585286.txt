The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle 1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the roadway on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was too fast for curve/turn, a driver decision error. This was chosen because the driver indicated she was traveling 64-72 KMPH (40-45 MPH). There is a design deficiency to this curve. The posted speed limit should be no more than 40 KMPH (25 MPH) for the radius of 82 Meters. Associated factors coded to this driver were inexperience, fatigue, strenuous recreational activities, overcompensation, poor directional control and insufficient steering and braking inputs.
