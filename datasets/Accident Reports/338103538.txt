This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 21 year old female driver of a 2010 Toyota Camry LE 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of a full frontal collision with a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4x4 4-door sport utility (Vehicle 2). The case vehicle was also equipped with driver's knee bolster air bag that deployed, (seat back mounted) side air bags for the front outboard seating positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions (non-deployed). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two-lane rural roadway, and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was westbound on the same roadway. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed Vehicle 1 to cross the centerline, into the path of the westbound Jeep. As Vehicle 1 entered the westbound travel lane, the frontal area struck the frontal area of Vehicle 2. Impact resulted in severe damage to Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 came to rest on the north shoulder facing southeast. Vehicle 2 came to rest across the eastbound lane facing northeast. Following the crash, the driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
