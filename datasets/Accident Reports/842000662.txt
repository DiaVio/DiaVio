This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 59 year old male driver, and unrestrained 60 year old female front right passenger of a 2005 Ford Ranger XLT 4x2 regular cab pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2006 Ford Focus 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. V2, a 2006 Ford Focus 4-door sedan, was westbound and also proceeding straight. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. As both vehicles entered a bridge (which crossed a stream), Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 entered the westbound lane, the front right area impacted the frontal area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage (event #1). Upon impact, Vehicle 2 was re-directed rearward in a southeasterly direction and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing northwest. Vehicle 1 rotated slightly clockwise as the left side surface subsequently struck the adjacent (north) guardrail and bridge railing (event #2). Vehicle 1's initial impact and subsequent engagement with the bridge initiated a 1 quarter turn left side rollover, which resulted in additional/overlapping moderate damage (event #3). Vehicle 1 came to rest (on its left side) in the roadway facing northwest. Both occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local hospital, then transferred to a trauma center. Both occupants of Vehicle 1 were hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The driver sustained injuries with a MAIS of 4and an ISS of 25. The passenger had a MAIS of 3 and an ISS of 9. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
