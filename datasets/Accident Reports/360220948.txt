This case occupant is a 29 year old male front right passenger, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a minor front right embankment impact followed by a severe rollover event with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours, under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Dodge Magnum station wagon, was eastbound in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway. The asphalt travel lanes have no shoulders or curbs, with an embankment and woody area present on the south side of the roadway. In V1's precrash area, the roadway has a slight downhill grade and curves to the left. As V1 negotiated the curve, it began to depart the roadway to the right. V1 traveled a short distance off the roadway, then V1's front right impacted the embankment, resulting in the deployment of the frontal air bags. V1 climbed up the embankment, causing the vehicle to begin to flip over to the left. As V1 was completing its ninth quarter turn, its left front struck a wooden signpost, resulting in minor damage. During the tenth quarter turn, V1's right front tire struck a tree, resulting in minor vehicle damage. V1 completed ten quarter turns in all and came to final rest facing southwest on its top, completely off the roadway, next to the tree. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the front right passenger of V1, a 29 year old male, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the embankment impact, his top instrument panel mounted front air bag deployed. This passenger sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. The 36 year old male driver was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted front air bag deployed during the crash. He sustained minor injuries and did not receive any medical treatment.
