Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2000 Honda CRV, four-door (case study vehicle). V1 was occupied by a female, age 53 as its driver and lone occupant. V1's occupant was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and the frontal airbags deployed. The crash occurred during the hours of daylight. The weather at the time of the crash was rain. The roadway surface was wet. The posted speed limit is 50 mph (80 kmph). The crash occurred on an interstate highway. The trafficway is divided by a concrete barrier. The trafficway travels primarily east and west. The eastbound direction consists of five through lanes with paved shoulders. The trafficway has a positive grade in the eastbound direction. V1 was traveling eastbound in the number 4 lane. V1's driver didn't observe the stopped traffic and swerved to the left. V1 continued to the left until impacting a concrete barrier head-on.
