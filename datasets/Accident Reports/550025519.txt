The case vehicle, a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am 4-door sedan was on the on-ramp merging onto a dry, level three-lane asphalt southbound roadway divided by a concrete median barrier that was part of a trafficway. It was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions. A non-contacted vehicle in front of the case vehicle put on its brakes unexpectedly and the driver of the case vehicle applied the brakes and veered left. The driver lost control of the vehicle and crossed the three southbound lanes, struck the median barrier on the east side of the roadway and rode up it, leaving paint transfers up the top edge of the barrier. The case vehicle was deflected back across the three southbound lanes and came to rest on the west shoulder adjacent to the concrete barrier on the west side of the roadway. The 42-year-old female driver was unrestrained and was the only occupant of the case vehicle. The driver frontal-impact air bag deployed. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and was enrolled as a case occupant.
