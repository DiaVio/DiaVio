The case occupant is a 21 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, involved in a head-on collision. His frontal impact air bag deployed and he sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during early morning hours in darkness with overhead street lights, under clear, dry weather conditions on a four lane, two way level roadway. In the area where the crash occurred, there are parking lanes and overhead street lights present on both sides of the travel lanes. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Ford Ranger XLT compact pickup, was traveling north in the inner northbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1997 Toyota Camry four door sedan, was traveling south in the inside southbound lane. As V1 and V2 approached one another, V1 crossed over the double yellow lane lines and traveled into V2's lane of travel. The front of V1 struck V2 head-on, resulting in the deployment of V1's dual front air bags. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the center of the roadway, facing northwest. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the west parking lane, facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 21 year old male driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a front steering column mounted air bag deployment. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center where he was hospitalized for five days. No other occupants were in V1. The driver and sole occupant of V2 was pronounced dead at the scene.
