This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 21 year old male driver of a 1998 Honda Civic EX 2-door coupe. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a frontal impact with a 1985 Toyota Regular Cab 4x2 pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve on apporach to a 3-leg "Y" intersection. Vehicle 2 was facing northbound and attempting to turn left (west) at the intersection. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Vehicle 2 entered the intersection to proceed west, across the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the intersection, the frontal area impacted the frontal area of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage. At impact, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and came to rest across the east/westbound lanes facing northwest. Vehicle 2 also rotated clockwise and came to rest in the westbound lane facing northeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
