Case 2007-43-188

This single-vehicle crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekend on an intrastate highway. The concrete highway consists of 3-lanes for each direction and is divided by a grass median and tension-cable guardrail, with a posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The road is straight, flat, dry and the weather conditions were clear and daylight. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

V1, a 2007 Pontiac G6 with two occupants, was eastbound in lane one when it steered to the left to avoid a wooden pallet that was in its lane. V1 lost control and spun off the left side of the highway and into the guardrail. Neither the driver and passenger were injured but EMS was dispatched to the scene. The vehicle was towed from the scene.

The driver of V1 is a 31-year-old female that was driving east in lane one of this 3-lane divided highway when she saw the wooden pallet in her lane so tried to avoid it by steering to the left, which caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She said there was traffic ahead of her that was switching lanes and she did not understand why until she saw the pallet in the roadway. Once she saw this object she immediately swerved to the left and spun counterclockwise across the highway and into a cable guardrail.

The Critical Precrash Event was coded this vehicle traveling off the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded incorrect evasive action. Associated factors include impending problem masked by traffic flow pattern, did not realize caution was required, combination of insufficient steering and braking, poor directional control, and object in roadway.
