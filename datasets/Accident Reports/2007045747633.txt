Case 2007-149

The crash occurred on an undivided east/westbound two lane roadway with one lane in each direction. The asphalt roadway was wet due to an earlier rain, and level. The road curved to the right then became straight and then curved to the left. There were no traffic control devices and the posted speed limit was 48kmph/30mph. The crash happened just after noon on a weekday under cloudy skies with light traffic flow. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, a 2003 Toyota Highlander four-door SUV with one occupant was traveling eastbound in lane one. As it exited the curve to the right the vehicle's front right wheel struck and jumped the curb on the right edge of the road (Event 1) and continued traveling east on the roadside for approximately 20m until it struck and knocked down a 12cm tree with its front right (Event 2). From there the vehicle continued traveling eastward another 17m to where it's front right corner struck a 50cm tree (Event 3). V1 rotated slightly in a clockwise direction and flipped over onto its left side and then its top. The vehicle came to rest on its top facing southeast about 10m northeast of the third impact.

V1, the Toyota Highlander, was driven by an 18-year old male who was not injured. The driver report that he had just left a friend's house and was returning home traveling about 56kmph/35mph when he came out of the curve to the right. He noted that the road was wet but it was not raining at the time of the crash. He said he felt the vehicle begin to fish-tail so he tried to brake in an unsuccessful attempt to regain control before it jumped the curb, struck a tree and rolled over.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle lost control due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was driver related incorrect evasive action. The driver admitted traveling over the speed limit and losing traction. He braked rather than using a combination of braking and steering inputs with which he could have regained control. Associated factors were assigned to V1 for driver behavior, decision, traveling too fast for conditions (reason unknown); for driver behavior, performance, poor directional control; and for other driver related experience factors - inexperienced driver. He had less than a year of driving experience.
