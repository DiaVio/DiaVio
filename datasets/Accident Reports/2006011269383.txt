This crash occurred in the late evening of a weekday on an exit ramp from a fully controlled urban highway. The bituminous, single lane exit ramp was level and featured a curve to the right. Conditions at the time of the crash were dark, raining and wet on the road. A complete interview and vehicle inspection were obtained on the scene.

V1, a 1998 Jeep Cherokee, was returning home from a short trip to a store close to the driver's home. V1 was traveling in lane one of the highway and the driver was having trouble seeing the pavement markings for the exit due to the rain. The driver of the Jeep saw the exit, steered right onto the ramp and braked to slow down. As the driver braked, V1 began to skid clockwise. The driver braked even more and V1 slid completely out of control, rotating clockwise 180 degrees, and left the roadway on the right side. V1 continued down a >2% embankment with the left side leading, and when the tires dug into the wet and muddy ground, V1 rolled 1 quarter turn onto the left side. V1 came to final rest facing north, still on its left side. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was driven by a fully restrained 43 year-old female in good health and wearing her prescription lenses that correct a myopic (near-sighted) condition. She stated that she was having trouble seeing due to the rain and when she finally attempted to exit the highway she braked to slow down which caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered minor injuries as a result of the crash but refused medical treatment. V1 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as vehicle control loss, traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related factor, a decision error, too fast for conditions. Associated factor coded to this driver include traveling too fast for conditions, as the driver did not realize that caution was required, also incorrect evasive action because she lost control initially by continuing to brake causing the vehicle to slide and spin out of control. Driver inexperience was also included as the driver had been licensed for less than a year, and had experience with that class of vehicle for even less time. The heavy rains and wet roads also played a role in this crash.
