This rollover case involves a 47 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with no air bag deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way dirt roadway during early morning daylight hours under dry weather conditions. There are no curbs on either side of the travel lanes and on the north side of the road there is a steep dirt and grass slope that leads to a swamp. In V1's precrash area, the eastbound lane is level and curves to the left. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, was traveling east and was negotiating the curve when the driver lost control of the vehicle. V1 rotated counterclockwise and departed the roadway to the left. The back of V1 traveled down the slope and impacted the ground, resulting in moderate damage. V1 pivoted to the right and began to rollover. V1 completed four quarter turns in the swamp and came to final rest on its tires, facing northeast, partially submerged in the water. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 47 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a nearby clinic prior to being transferred to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
