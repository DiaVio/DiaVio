This case involves a right-side (far-side relevant to the case occupant) impact to the case vehicle, a pick-up truck, by a passenger car, which resulted in the pick-up rolling over eight-quarter turns, left side leading and coming to rest on its wheels. The 61-year-old male driver is the case occupant. He was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The vehicle was not equipped with the optional side-impact curtain air bags. The case vehicle, a 2008 Dodge Dakota crew-cab 4x4 pick-up truck was travelling in the outside, northbound through-lane of a divided, dry, level concrete six-lane traffic-way approaching the intersection with a four-lane traffic-way. Vehicle two (V2) a 2004, four-door Toyota Camry was in the outside westbound lane of the intersecting traffic-way approaching the same intersection. It was dark, but lighted and cloudy. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, the front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise out of the intersection and into the raised median north of it. The left-rear wheel struck the curb. The case vehicle tripped and entered an eight-quarter turn, left-side leading rollover. The case vehicle rolled along the raised median, through a traffic channel and came to rest in the inside northbound through lane facing east. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the northeast corner of the intersection facing northeast. The 61-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He was restrained by a three point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
