Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an 18-year old, male driver, of a 2005 Chevrolet 1500 Silverado pick-up truck, who was primarily involved in a frontal impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred in the morning hours (daylight) of a winter weekday, on a curved, two-lane roadway. This east/west roadway has a left turning curve and a positive uphill grade for the eastbound travel direction. The roadway has a speed limit of 35 mph (56 km/h) and, at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2005 Chevrolet 1500 pick-up truck, was being operated by the 18-year old male driver (case occupant), in the eastbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was not belted, but the vehicle was equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags. The driver of Vehicle 1 was negotiating the left turning curve and intended to continue traveling east. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the left turning curve, it drifted off the right edge of the roadway (south edge). At this time, Vehicle 1 slipped down a slight embankment, while traveling east, and struck a tree with its right side plane (event 1) and then struck another tree with its frontal plane (event 2). Vehicle 1 came to rest at the second impacted tree, facing an easterly direction. As a result of the second tree impact, the driverâ€™s frontal air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was removed from the vehicle by responding emergency medical services personnel and transported, by land and air units, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
