This crash occurred at night with street lights located in the area with a posted speed limit of 25 mph/40 kmph. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mazda Mazda6 four door sedan, was southbound at a high rate of speed on a two lane, two way residential street that curved to the left with a downgrade and the surface was wet. The driver of V1 was distracted inside the vehicle and at the curve impacted the right tires into the curb with the front tire scraped and damaged. V1 then returned to the roadway without control and began to rotate clockwise before departing the road to the right. V1 impacted a tree directly into the left side driver's door just ahead of the seat position. The 45 year old male driver of V1 is the case occupant and alone in the vehicle. He was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and frontal airbags did not deploy on the lateral impact. The intrusion of the door panel trapped the driver's leg and required a lengthy extrication time. The driver was airlifted to the trauma center and the vehicle was destroyed and towed.
