The case vehicle a 4-door 1999 Ford Taurus was southbound on a snowy, two-lane, level asphalt roadway. It was daylight and snowing. Vehicle two (V2) a 2004 Huyndai Santa Fe SUV, was northbound on the same roadway. V2 drifted off the edge of the east shoulder and the driver steered left to return to the roadway. The driver of V2 lost control and V2 entered a counterclockwise yaw of less than 30 degrees. The driver of the case vehicle saw V2 moving out of control and began to steer the case vehicle onto the west gravel shoulder. V2 crossed the center line and the front of V2 struck the front of the case vehicle in an oblique, off-set frontal mode. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise slightly before it came to rest on the gravel shoulder facing southwest. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest straddling both travel lanes facing west. Both vehicles were towed form the scene. The only occupant of the case vehicle was the 42-year-old female driver. She was improperly restrained by a three-point restraint. The lap portion of the belt was run behind the seat back and only the shoulder belt portion was in use, as evidenced by a witness mark on the D-ring. The steering-wheel air bag did not deploy during the crash. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital with serious injuries. She was later transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
