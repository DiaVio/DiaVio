The case vehicle, a 2002 four-door Hyundai Accent was traveling in the center southbound lane of dry, level, six-lane asphalt divided highway. Vehicle Two (V2) a 1990 Plymouth Lazer was traveling in the outside southbound lane of the same roadway. It was dark, but lighted and there were no adverse weather conditions. As the case vehicle merged into the outside southbound lane, its front contacted the left quarter-panel of V2. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 180 degrees and came to a rest facing north in the outside southbound lane. After impacting V2 the front of the case vehicle struck a concrete traffic barrier and rolled over four quarter-turns and came to rest in the distress lane facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 53-year-old male driver was not restrained by a three-point belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. 63-year-old male right-front passenger was not restrained by a three-point belt and the mid instrument-panel air bag deployed. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant. 63-year-old male right-front passenger sustained police reported 'A' injuries.
