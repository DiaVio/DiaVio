This frontal crash involves a 41year old restrained female seated in the front left (Driver) seating position with deployed steering wheel and roof side rail air bags who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred in the evening hours (dark) in snowy weather. The collision occurred on a level two lane bituminous roadway that curves to the right just north of the crash site. Just south of the crash site V1 was traveling across a bridge (concrete roadway) which was plowed but icy. There is one northbound travel lane and one southbound travel lane and there are no traffic control devices for each direction. The case vehicle (V1), a 2010 four-door Chevrolet Equinox, was being driven northbound at the time of the crash. The crash occurred as V1 was traveling northbound across a bridge when the driver lost control on the icy roadway and traveled off the south road edge and onto a gravel driveway. V1 then traveled off the edge of the driveway impacting a tree with its front bumper. This was its final resting position. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 41 year old female case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt. The retractor type pretensioner actuated as a result of the crash. The available steering wheel air bag, side curtain mounted air bag both deployed as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat was positioned between the middle and rear position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was injured in the crash and transported by ground ambulance to an outside hospital before being transferred to a local level 1 trauma center for treatment of her injuries.
