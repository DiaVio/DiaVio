This single vehicle crash involved two case occupants who were involved in a minor frontal impact, followed by a rollover event and embankment impact. The first case occupant is a 48 year old male driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment, who sustained serious injuries. The second case occupant is a 4 year old male second row right side passenger, seated in a forward facing high-back belt positioning booster seat, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt, and who also sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in the southbound lanes of a five lane, one way divided interstate highway. There is a jersey barrier adjacent to the inside carpool only lane. On the west side of the travel lanes there is a paved shoulder followed by a grassy embankment. At the time of the crash there were clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Ford Expedition large utility vehicle, was traveling south in the carpool lane, and was approaching a freeway overpass. For unknown reasons, the driver of V1 drifted over the left lane line and the front of V1 impacted a large overpass bridge support column, resulting in minor sideswipe damage. V1 was redirected back into the southbound lanes, went into a clockwise rotation and began to rollover to the left, completing one quarter turn. V1 slid on its left side in a southwesterly direction across the travel lanes and shoulder. V1 continued off the west side of the freeway and the front impacted a grassy embankment, resulting in moderate damage. V1 continued to roll over and came to final rest on its tires, facing west. A minor fire then occurred in the engine compartment of V1 that was put out. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 48 year old male, was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed on impact with the embankment. He sustained serious injuries. The second row right passenger, a 4year old male, was seated in a forward facing, high-back belt positioning booster seat and was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt. He also sustained serious injuries. Both occupants were transported to the trauma center for treatment. The driver was hospitalized for five days and the four year old was hospitalized for three days.
