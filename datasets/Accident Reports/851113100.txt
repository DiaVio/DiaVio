This crash occurred at night with no street lights and the roadway surface was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Saturn SC2 - 2 door coupe, was northbound on a two lane, two way rural road that curved to the left and had a speed limit of 35 mph/56kmph. V1 approached the curve and then began to rotate counterclockwise after the curve and crossed over the opposite lane and departed the roadway left. V1 was sliding laterally when the right front of V1 impacted a small tree, and a large tree stump before it struck a large landscape boulder at the right B-pillar to the right rear axle. The boulder was moved approximately 4 meters with V1 against it at final rest. Major intrusion occurred in the right passenger seating areas with a lateral direction of force near 100 degrees. The driver of V1 was the case occupant who was a 20 year old male wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt. No air bags deployed. The case occupant moved laterally to the right, slightly deforming the seatback and sliding out of the shoulder belt. The case occupant was airlifted to the trauma center and V1 was towed and disabled.
