Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Colorado, 4-door pickup truck was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the dirt road surface was snow covered. The driver of V1 reportedly rapidly accelerated from a slow speed but the driver lost control and V1 departed the right side of the road. V1 departed the right side of the road where the roadside climbs up and above the road surface. V1 began to climb this embankment when the driver steered left in an attempt to regain the road. V1 entered into a counterclockwise yaw, tripped over its right wheels and rolled 4-quarter turns. V1 came to rest on its wheel, partially on the road facing south-southeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 18-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
