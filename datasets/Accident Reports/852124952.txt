This crash occurred at an intersection during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Camry four door sedan was northbound on a two lane, two way road with stop signs for the north and south directions at this intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford F350 super cab 4x4 truck was westbound travelling through the intersection with no controls for the east or west directions. As both vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V2 impacted the right side front half of V1. This impact rotated V1 counterclockwise with the right side of V1 side slapping into the left side of V2. Both vehicles then continued off the northwest corner of the intersection. V1 went straight into the ditch and the front of V1 impacted the embankment with front of V1 where it came to final rest facing northwest. The frontal air bags reportedly then deployed in V1 from this impact. V2 rotated clockwise from the point of impact with V1 and slid laterally with the left side leading into the ditch and the left side impacted into the embankment where it came to final rest facing northeast. Both vehicles had to be towed due to damage. Case vehicle one had a driver and one occupant. The case occupant is the front right passenger who is an 82 year old female and wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt. The belt pretensioner had fired and the front instrument panel mounted air bag deployed on impact with the front of V1 into the embankment. The case occupant had severe injuries and was brought to the trauma center. The driver was a 59 year old female who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and the pretensioner fired and the front steering column mounted air bag deployed. This driver was treated for only minor injuries.
