This case involved the (integrated) belted 71-year-old male driver of a pickup responding to a frontal impact with a passenger car. The subject's frontal-impact air bag deployed during the one o'clock principal direction of force collision. The vehicle sustained 'moderate' damage. The subject received serious thoracic injuries. This two-vehicle crash occurred within a four-way intersection in an urban area. There was a single lane for travel in each direction, separated by a painted double yellow line, for both streets. The intersection was controlled by tri-color traffic signals. The Case Vehicle (V1, 2004 Chevrolet 1500 Silverado, extended cab) was traveling southbound on its approach to the intersection with the intention of turning left. The vehicle's first row lap and shoulder belts were integrated into the seatback, and there were first row frontal-impact air bags. The 71-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1983 Mercedes Benz 300D, 4-door sedan) was traveling northbound on its approach to the intersection with the intention of traveling straight through. V1 entered the intersection and had begun a left-turn maneuver when it traveled into the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the front of V1, while in mid-turn. The one o'clock principal direction of force impact caused moderate vehicle damage and resulted in a serious injury to the subject. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injuries.
