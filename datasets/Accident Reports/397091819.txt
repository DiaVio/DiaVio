This crash occurred on a multi-lane divided trafficway. The trafficway is situated in a northeast to southwest configuration and is comprised of 3 travel lanes in each direction separated by a raised grass median without a positive barrier. At the time of the crash it was early evening. It was raining and the road surface was wet. Traffic for that time of the day can be moderate to heavy. Involved in the crash was the case vehicle (V1) a 2003 Dodge caravan 4-door mini-van equipped with manual 3-point lap and shoulder restraints for each outboard seating position. In addition to the manual restraints, V1 was also equipped with driver and right passenger frontal impact air bags, both of which deployed in the crash. The driver of the case vehicle was a 21-year-old male. He was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. V1 was traveling in a southwesterly direction in the third lane. It was raining and the road surface was wet. As V1 proceeded southwest, the driver lost control of the vehicle due to standing water on the roadway. When the driver lost control of V1, it departed the roadway into the center median and continued in a southwesterly direction. The case vehicle then struck a large palm tree with the left half of the front end. The palm tree sheared off at ground level from the impact. After the impact the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest facing in an easterly direction. The driver of V1 did not loose consciousness in the crash. He was removed from V1 by the paramedics and transported to the trauma center via helicopter with a trauma criterion of a GCS < 13.
