This frontal crash case involves a 33 year old male second row right side passenger, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with no air bag deployments. He sustained serious injuries in the crash. This crash occurred during the early morning hours, in darkness with overhead street lights, overcast weather and dry roadway conditions. In this area, the roadway is comprised of one north and one southbound travel lane, with a left turn only lane available for southbound vehicles intending to turn onto an unrelated intersecting street. In the pre-crash area, the southbound lane curves to the right, then straightens out as it crosses under a freeway overpass that is supported by large concrete pillars. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Jeep Liberty compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane one. As V1 was negotiating the curve, it departed the roadway to the right, traveled approximately 25 meters through grass and dirt, and then its front impacted a large overpass/bridge pillar, resulting in the deployment of both front row frontal air bags. V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest in the southbound travel lane, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 33 year old male in the second row right seating position. He was using the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments in his seating area. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver of V1 was a 24 year old male who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and his steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deployed. He sustained minor injuries and was taken to a local hospital for treatment. There was a 40 year old male passenger in the second row left seating position, who was using the available manual lap/shoulder belt. He sustained minor injuries and was also taken to an outside hospital for treatment.
