This case involved a belted driver responding to a ten quarter-turn rollover crash with a seat back mounted side impact air bag deployment. This crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a six-lane, divided, east west interstate. There were three lanes for travel in each direction divided by a concrete barrier. The trafficway was level and had a gradual right curve for northbound traffic. The weather was cloudy but the bituminous roadway was dry during the mid-morning, weekday crash. The case vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Mercury Mountaineer 4-door SUV, was traveling northbound in the number-two lane. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, driver and passenger frontal impact air bags and first row seat back mounted air bags. The 53-year-old driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint based on the belt being found, locked, in the spooled out position. A second vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Toyota Camry, was involved with V1 in a relatively minor impact, which resulted in V1 losing control. V2 was traveling northbound in the number-three lane (left). V1 began a lane change to the left (from the number-two to the number-three lane) not seeing that V2 was occupying the lane. The left rear of V1 made contact with the right side of V2 to the extent that V1's left rear wheel ended up mounting and rolling over V2's right fender and front right bumper. This fact was documented on the crash report along with an image that seems to verify V1's LR wheel on top of V2's bumper. Regardless, the contact caused V1 to lose control, allowing the vehicle to swerve to the right across the travel lanes. The subject (driver) of V1, apparently, steered back to the left sending the vehicle into an ever-increasing counterclockwise yaw. It is surmised that V1's right rear tire lost its bead as it slid laterally and the rim gouged the bituminous roadway causing the vehicle to 'trip' to the right. V1 traveled an approximated 9.8 meters from its trip point to its first landing, and then an additional 32 meters to its final rest position according to police crash report measurements. During the sequence it is estimated that V1 overturned ten quarter-turns coming to rest on its top with its left side near the center divider (facing south). The vehicle's first row seat back mounted side impact air bags both deployed. During the initial event, V2 was deflected to the left (into the median) and began a slight clockwise rotation and V2 came to rest facing north. Both vehicles were towed from the scene, V1 due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to visible injuries described on the crash report.
