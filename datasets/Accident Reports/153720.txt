Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound through-lane of a two-way, three lane road (one lane eastbound, one lane westbound, one westbound left-turn lane). Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Jeep Liberty, compact utility vehicle was also traveling west in the westbound lane and was behind V1. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Ford F150, 4-door pickup was traveling east in the eastbound lane. It was dark, its was snowing with blowing snow, and the asphalt road surface was wet. The driver of V2 lost control of his vehicle on the slippery surface and crossed the centerline, left-turn lane and into the westbound lane. The driver of V1 braked but could not avoid V2 and the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset mode. The impact caused V1 to rotate counter clockwise and the front of V3 then struck the left side of V1. V2 reportedly also made contact with the left side of V3. All three vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 28-year-old male driver of V2 was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with unknown injuries. The 38-year-old male driver of V3 was also transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with unknown injuries. The 17-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air abg deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 15-year-old male right-front passenger was also using the availble three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries.
