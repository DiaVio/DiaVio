Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Dodge Caravan Minivan, was traveling north in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway approaching an intersection under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Chevrolet Astro Minivan, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway approaching the same intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection and the front of V2 contacted the left front of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise 180 degrees and depart the roadway to the northeast, where it struck two trees and came to final rest. V2 came to final rest in the northeast corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and the case study occupant was a 38-year-old male. He was not wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. In addition to the driver, there were five other occupants in V1. The right front passenger was a 38-year-old female who was wearing a lap and shoulder belt. 2nd row left passenger was a three-month-old male in a forward facing, five point child safety seat. The 2nd row right passenger was a 3-year-old female also in a forward facing, five point child safety seat. The 3rd row left passenger was a 6-year-old male wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The 3rd row right passenger was a 9-year-old male wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The case study occupant was transported to a level-one trauma center by air for treatment. The other occupants were all treated and released at a local hospital.
