He stated in his interview that he was trying to change lanes to the left, into lane three. He said as he tried to change lanes his vehicle started to lose control and start to fishtail. He said he tried to apply the brakes and it just made the vehicle lose control across three lanes of traffic till he made contact with the left side concrete barrier wall.

The lane he was traveling in was concrete and had not been re-paved. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1.
