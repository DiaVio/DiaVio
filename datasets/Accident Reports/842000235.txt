Case vehicle, a 2000 Mitsubishi Eclispe, being driven by a 15-year-old male, 175 cm in height (5'9") and weighing approximately 96 kg (211 lbs). He was traveling north on a two-lane rural paved road coming out of a sweeping left-hand turn when it departed the road to the right. As the case vehicle departed the paved surface, it began to rotate counter-clockwise. The driver of the case vehicle overcorrected bringing the vehicle back onto the pavement where it began to rotate clockwise. The vehicle departed the road to the right again as the clockwise rotation increased. The case vehicle went through a barbed wire fence, rotated clockwise before coming in contact with a tree, approximately 3 to 4 meters east of the road, with the drivers' side of the case vehicle. The case vehicle then rotated off of the tree in a counter-clockwise movement and continued east into the wooded area. The counter-clockwise rotation continued until the case vehicle tripped and rolled onto the passenger side. It came to rest on its top. The case occupant was unrestrained and the airbag deployed as a result of the crash. The case occupant was transported from the scene by ambulance to a local medical facility for treatment. From there, the case occupant was transferred to a Level 1 Trauma Center to continue treatment on his rib, clavicle, spleen and sacral injuries. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage.
