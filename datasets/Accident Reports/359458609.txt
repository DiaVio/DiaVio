This moderate severity frontal crash involved a case occupant who was a 29 year old female and restrained with a lap/shoulder belt and frontal airbag, and was in a reclined seatback position. She sustained severe injuries and transported to the trauma center. This crash occurred on two, one way lanes of a divided freeway in a construction area at night with no lights in the area. It was raining and the roadway was wet with standing water. Vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Mazda Mazda3 four door sedan, was westbound in lane one of the two lanes that were bordered by concrete barriers on both sides as the roadway curved to the right. After the curve the right side shoulder barrier ended and opened up to a large new paved area that was bordered on the north side by a mountain, rock wall. V1 was negotiating this curve right and started to hydroplane on some standing water on the roadway and lost control. V1 then departed the roadway to the right after the barrier ended, crossed over the open paved area and struck the front of V1 into the moutain, rock wall. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing north near the wall. V1 was towed and disable. The case occupant is the front right passenger who is a 29 year old female.
