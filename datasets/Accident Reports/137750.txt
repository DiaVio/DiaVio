Vehcile one (V1 - case vehicle) a 2004 Dodge Ram 2500, Quad cab pickup was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. It was dark, the weather was cloudy and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 swerved left to avoid a deer in the road, crossed the centerline and eastbound lane and departed the left side of the roadway. V1 struck a tree off the left side of the road. The initial contact occurred above the left-front bumper in the area of the left headlight, as the impact progressed, the tree contacted the left fender, A-pillar and windshield header. The impact resulted in the case vehicle rotating in a counter clockwise manner that resulted in a right-side leading rollover. V1 rolled two quarter turns and the roll was interrupted by small sapling trees. V1 came to rest off the left side of the road, on its roof, facing south-southeast. The 55-year-old male driver (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via air ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe injuries. The driver was alone in the vehicle although a large, unrestrained dog was also riding in the cab of the truck. The dog was reportedly not injured. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
