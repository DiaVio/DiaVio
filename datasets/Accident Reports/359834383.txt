This severe frontal crash involved a 45 year old female driver who was restrained with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This head-on crash occurred at dawn in a curved section of a two lane, two way highway with paved shoulders. At the time of the crash there were wet and rainy weather and roadway conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Ford Focus two door hatchback, was travelling in the eastbound lane and was negotiating the curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Chevrolet Impala four door sedan, was in the westbound lane and negotiating the curve to the right. Vehicle three (V3), a 1993 Chevrolet C1500 large pickup truck, was traveling slightly behind V1. As V2 was negotiating the curved section of roadway, V2 departed the lane to the left, crossed the centerline and traveled into the eastbound travel lane. V1's driver attempted to avoid V2 by braking and steering right. V1 traveled onto the south shoulder as V2 also entered the shoulder. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. V1 rotated clockwise while being forced rearward and back into the eastbound travel lane. The driver of V3, which had been traveling just behind V1, braked and swerved slightly left in an attempt to avoid V1, but the front of V3 impacted the right side of V1, resulting in minor damage. V3 came to final rest facing east in the eastbound lane. V1 came to rest facing southeast in the eastbound lane. V2 came to final rest on the south shoulder, facing northwest. V1 and V2 were disabled and towed. V3 was driven from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who is a 45 year old female, and the only one in the vehicle. She was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and her frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center where she was hospitalized for three days.
