This frontal crash involves a 63-year-old restrained male driver who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred in the morning at dawn under dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a three lane, one way divided roadway, part of a six lane, two way traffic way. The case vehicle (V1), a 2005 Honda Pilot utility vehicle, was being driven eastbound on the roadway. The crash occurred when V1, due to a possible syncope episode by the driver, drove off the roadway to the right, where it struck a large pole anchored by a concrete slab. After the pole impact V1 rotated clockwise with the rear tires remaining on the paved shoulder and the front tires in the unpaved area adjacent to the shoulder. V1 traveled approximately 30 feet before rolling one quarter turn onto the driver side and coming to final rest half on the right shoulder of the roadway and half in the unpaved area adjacent to the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by the 63-year-old case occupant who was restrained by a three-point lap and shoulder belt. No air bags deployed during the crash. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
