This case involves an impact to the right side of a passenger car by the front-end of another passenger car. The unrestrained driver of the case vehicle is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2003, four-door, Pontiac Grand Am was in the channelized northbound left-turn lane of a divided eight-lane, uphill grade >2%, dry, concrete traffic-way. It was daylight and clear. Construction resulted in the narrowing of the trafficway to three travel lanes on either side of the raised median. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Chevrolet Impala was in the center southbound lane. As the case vehicle was crossing over the southbound lanes to enter an access road, it crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle with the impact initiating on the right-front door behind the A-pillar. The unrestrained 23-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
