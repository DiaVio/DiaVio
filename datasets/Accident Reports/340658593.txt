This case involves an impact between the front of a passenger car and the back of a parked Ford Explorer SUV. The case vehicle, a 2008 four-door Toyota Corolla, was travelling in the outside eastbound lane of a divided, dry, uphill, concrete, four-lane traffic-way approaching a three-leg intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. The driver experienced a syncopal episode. The vehicle passed through the intersection, entered the parking lane east of it and struck a parked 2013 Ford Explorer SUV. The case vehicle came to a rest in the parking lane facing east. The restrained 73-year-old female driver was the only occupant in the case vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
