This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 29 year old female driver of a 2007 Honda Odyssey Touring minivan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags/seat back mounted side airbags (for the driver and front right passenger positions), and curtain air bags (for all outboard seating positions). The driver frontal air bag, right front side air bag, and left/right curtain air bags deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a large diameter tree (event 4). The crash occurred off the east pavement edge of a two-lane north/south rural roadway. A hillcrest was located just south of the crash site, as the asphalt surfaced roadway curved left (with a negative grade) for northbound traffic. It was dark,with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The posted speed limit at the crash site was 35 mph (56 km/h). Traffic controls present in the vicinity consisted of curve warning signs for north and southbound vehicles entering the "S" curve from their respective straightaways. Vehicle 1 was northbound and crested a hill when it began to travel downhill on approach to the apex of the left curve. At this point, the driver allowed Vehicle 1 to depart the right (east) pavement edge in a forward tracking mode. The case vehicle continued a northeasterly direction across two residential yards as the frontal area struck a small sapling and two landscaping posts (events 1-3), resulting in minor damage. These initial events did not alter the vehicle's trajectory as it subsequently impacted a large diameter tree (event 4) which resulted in severe damage. Vehicle 1 rotated slightly clockwise and rebounded to final rest in close proximity to the struck tree facing northeast. The restrained 29 year old female driver of the 2007 Honda Odyssey was presumed to be seated in an upright posture, with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-forward track position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. The first three events were minor in nature and produced little if no kinematic response from the driver. At impact 4, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force. This contact evidence was attributed to driver head engagement. Extensive intrusion of interior vehicle components also produced an entrapment mechanism of the driver's lower extremities between the seat cushion and (left/center) instrument panel. Following the collision, the restrained 29 year old female driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was extricated from the vehicle by rescue personnel and transported via air to a nearby trauma center where she was admitted for treatment of serious injury. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
