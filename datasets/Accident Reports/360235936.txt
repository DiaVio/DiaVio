The case occupant is an 88 year old male driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal airbag deployment. He was involved in a severe rollover collision and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a curved section of a divided freeway. The two eastbound travel lanes are bordered by paved shoulders and concrete traffic barriers. The weather was clear, and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Chrysler PT Cruiser was in lane one and was approaching the curve in the roadway (curves to the left). V1 continued straight and departed the lane to the right, traveled over the paved shoulder and the front right corner of V1 impacted the concrete barrier. V1 was deflected to the left slightly from this initial impact and the front right corner and front right tire impacted the barrier a second time. The front right tire contact mark on the barrier was visible showing the tire ramping up the side of the barrier. V1 then began to rollover to the left into the eastbound lanes. V1 completed six quarter turns and came to final rest on its roof facing east across both eastbound lanes. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver is the case occupant and only occupant in V1. He is an 88 year old male who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and his frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed during the initial impact into the barrier. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital before being transferred to the trauma center.
