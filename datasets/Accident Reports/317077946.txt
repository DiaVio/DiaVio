This case is a one vehicle crash involving a 2002 Landrover Discovery 4-door SUV. The crash occurred just after dark on a two-lane rural roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions and the road was dry at the time of the crash. The driver, and only occupant of the vehicle, is a 30 year old male who was restrained by the available three point manual belts. The vehicle was equipped with frontal airbags that did not deploy in the crash. There were no side impact airbags available in this vehicle. The vehicle was traveling in an area where the road was straight with a 4% downhill grade when a deer ran into its path of travel. The driver steered right to try to avoid striking the animal, but was unsuccessful. The vehicle struck the deer with the right side of the front bumper. The vehicle then started skidding in a clockwise yaw and traveled off the right side of the roadway striking a wooden mailbox post with the left side of the front bumper. The post broke upon impact and the vehicle continued 33 meters off the shoulder of the roadway before impacting a large tree with its left side and coming to rest at the tree. The vehicle was towed from the scene due to disabling damage and the driver was transported to a nearby hospital where he remained for several days before being transferred to a level one trauma center for treatment.
