This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 62-year-old, male driver with deployed airbags. He sustained serious injuries in a frontal collision with a medium-sized tree. The crash occurred early morning on a wet road in the rain. The ambient lighting was dark with no street lighting. A 2009 Nissan Quest minivan (V1) was traveling west negotiating a right curve. The road was suburban, bituminous, two-way, two-lane, with proper superelevation in the curve of +5%. The crash occurred at a hillcrest. As V1 was negotiating the right curve, it traveled left across the center line and off the left side of the road. V1 traveled across a residential yard, over a driveway, and then into another yard before striking a tree of 30 cm diameter with its front plane (Event 1). The impact caused V1 to rotate counter-clockwise approximately 45 degrees before coming to final rest next to the tree. V1 was towed due to damage. The 62-year-old, male driver was unbelted. The retractor pretensioner actuated, locking the belt into the unused position. The steering wheel hub, left outboard seatback, and left curtain airbags were deployed. The available right front instrument panel, right side seatback, and right curtain airbags were not deployed. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
