This crash occurred just after noon on a weekday on a two-lane, two-way, undivided roadway. The rural, gravel/slag covered roadway feature a curve to the left and a downward grade greater than 2%. The ice-covered roadway had a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55mph). At the time of the crash it was daylight and cloudy.

V1, a 1996 Chevrolet full size conversion van, was eastbound traveling between 56-64kmph (35-40mph). As V1 negotiated the curve it began to slide towards the right and exit the roadway. V1 contacted a tree (diameter >10cm) with its front plane and came to final rest against the tree. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was driven by 38 year-old female in good health despite suffering from bronchitis and a sinus infection at the time of the crash. She stated she tried to steer left and brake when she felt the vehicle start drifting to the right. The driver said she was familiar with the road and knew about the curve and the hill, but she had not driven on the road since the snow had caused it to become ice covered. The driver sustained minor injuries and the passenger was uninjured. V1 was towed due to damage.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as a control loss, due to poor road conditions (ice). The Critical Reason for Critical Precrash Event was a driver related factor, a decision error, traveling too fast for conditions. Some associated factors to the crash include the driver worrying about getting home in time to meet her son when he arrived on the school bus. She was in a hurry, was thinking about being late and traveling too fast for conditions. The roadway conditions also factored into this crash as the road was totally ice covered with a downhill curve.
