Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Focus, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural dirt road. It was dark, the weather was cloudy and the dirt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and the vehicle entered a counterclockwise yaw. V1 departed the left side of the road while yawing with the right side leading and V1 tripped over the right wheels. V1 was inverted 90 degrees and airborne when it struck a large tree with the top plane of the vehicle. The tree was knocked down and V1 continued to roll into an agricultural field. V1 rolled a total of six quarter turns before coming to rest in a field on its roof. The 16-year-old male driver (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center and admitted with critical injuries. The 19-year-old male right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center where he was treated and released serious injuries (AIS-3, ISS-14). Vehicle one was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
