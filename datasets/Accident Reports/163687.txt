Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan was traveling through an interchange area in the middle lane of three northbound lanes (three northbound lanes, protected median, two southbound lanes). A non-contact vehicle (NCV) was in the left northbound lane traveling behind V1 and at a faster rate. The left northbound lane merges to the right and the NCV passed V1 on the left and merged in front of V1. This action caused the driver of V1 to lose control of his vehicle and depart the left side of the road and into the median. The front of V1 struck a metal guardrail (thri-beam) and V1 rotated counterclockwise and the right side struck a second metal guardrail (W-beam) at the end treatment. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 69-year-old male driver was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was not injured and refused medical treatment. The 61-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted, seat back-mounted, and roof siderail-mounted air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
