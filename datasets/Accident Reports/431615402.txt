This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 24-year-old male seated in the front left seating position (Driver) with deployed frontal and knee bolster air bags who sustained serious injuries. The seat back mounted and curtain air bags for this seating position did not deploy. The crash occurred just after midnight in dry and clear weather within the confines of an interchange. There are six southbound asphalt (level) travel lanes (four lanes divided by individual plastic pylons separating two additional Express lanes). The roadway is curved to the left and has a posted speed limit 55 mph (88.5 km/h). The case vehicle (V1), a 2009 four-door Mitsubishi Lancer was being driven southbound in the right second lane. Vehicle #1 was traveling southbound when for unknown reasons it traveled off the roadway to the right impacting a concrete traffic barrier. After impacting the concrete barrier, V1traveled across all six southbound travel lanes before crossing the left shoulder and impacting the front bumper with a second concrete barrier. V1 then rotated counter clockwise off the second barrier before traveling to its final resting position partially in the left express lane facing northeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by a 24-year-old male case occupant who was unrestrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. The seat belt was engaged but, the driver was sitting on it at the time of the crash. The available steering wheel mounted air bag and the knee bolster air bag deployed as a result of this crash but, it has not been determined which impact triggered the air bag deployments. This case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground transportation for treatment of his injuries.
