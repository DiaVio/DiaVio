This single vehicle crash occurred during the early morning daylight hours. The location is an arterial roadway in an area lined by trees and hidden driveways. The road parallels the river on the south side with multiple curves. The roadway is a level, bituminous two-lane, two way road with narrow shoulders on both sides that is curved to the right in the eastbound direction of travel. A guardrail protects the north roadside and the south side has a ditch with a positive embankment. The weather was cloudy, it was dark with out street lights and the pavement was wet from previous rain. The posted speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, driven by a nineteen (19) year old female was traveling eastbound negotiating a right curve. As the vehicle exited the curve the driver lost control and departed the roadway via the right shoulder. The driver stated that for unknown reasons the steering wheel turned to the left. She tried to steer back right and the steering wheel locked causing the vehicle to depart the right side of the road. The right front wheel went into the ditch and the right side near the front struck the ditch embankment. On impact V1 rotated clockwise while flipping forward and to the left. V1 came to rest on its top facing north. The driver was able to exit the vehicle without assistance. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn. There were no pre-impact vehicle related factors noted during the vehicle inspection by the researcher or by the investigating officer. The driver was on her morning daily commute from home to work and had been driving vehicles for two years. Poor directional control was considered an associative factor for this driver.
