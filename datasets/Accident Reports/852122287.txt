This crash occurred on a two lane, two way highway during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Scion TC two door hatchback was eastbound on this highway. Side roadways and driveways intersect along the highway and traffic in the eastbound lane was stopped behind a vehicle that was waiting to make a left turn at an uncontrolled intersection. V1 approached behind the stopped traffic and then swerved to the right off south side of the highway across a paved driveway to avoid a collision with the stopped vehicles. V1 started to brake as it crossed the paved driveway leaving tire yaws marks that continued off the pavement into a grassy area before the front left half of V1 impacted a large tree. V1 came to final rest against the tree and rotated slightly counterclockwise. V1 had significant frontal damage and was towed. The case V1 included two case occupants who were the only passengers. The driver, a 70 year old male, was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt with the pretensioners firing at impact. The front steering column mounted and knee bolster air bags deployed in this driver's position. The case driver was transported to the trauma center with serious injuries. The front right passenger, a 65 year old female, was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt with the pretensioners firing. The front instrument panel mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant had the seatback fully reclined at the time of impact and was fatally injured and died on scene.
