This case involved the 26 year old unrestrained female driver of a 2005 Nissan Altima four door sedan (V1) that was struck in the right side by a 1997 Chevrolet 1500 regular cab pickup truck (V2). V1's frontal airbags deployed, but it was not equipped with side impact or head curtain airbags. The driver was the only occupant of V1. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a three lane one-way city street. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The road was straight and level with a posted speed limit of 64 kph (40 mph). V1 was traveling in the center of the three southbound lanes with a 3% downhill grade prior to impact. The roadway leveled out just before the area of impact. V2 was exiting a business driveway from the west side of the the road onto the southbound roadway. V2 traveled across the right lane and into the center lane, striking V1 in the right front quarter panel. V1 veered left into the left lane and came to rest at the road edge. V2 continued forward and to the left, departing the east side of the roadway and striking a wooden utility pole with its frontal plane. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of injuries sustained in the crash.
