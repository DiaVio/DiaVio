This case involved the center front passenger and the right front passenger of a 2010 Toyota Tacoma regular cab pickup truck (V1). There were three total occupants in the vehicle, the 45 year old male driver, the 52 year old male center passenger and the 45 year old male right passenger. All three occupants were unrestrained by the available three-point safety belts. The frontal airbags deployed as well as the left and right side impact bags and the left and right side head curtain airbags. The crash occurred at dusk on a divided interstate highway where the three northbound lanes merged into two lanes. The dry asphalt roadway was straight with a slight uphill grade. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash and the posted speed limit was 113 kph (70 mph). V1 was traveling north in the right lane. Two non-contact vehicles were also traveling north, one in the center lane and one in the left lane. As the left lane merged into the center lane the non-contact vehicle in the left lane swerved into the center lane causing the non-contact vehicle in the center lane to swerve to the right into the right lane in the path of V1. V1 steered sharply to the right and departed the roadway, traveling along the roadside and behind a guardrail. V1 continued for 60 meters striking a large tree in a swiping type impact with its right rear and then impacting another large tree head-on. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to rest at the tree. V1 was towed due to disabling damage. The center and right passengers were both seriously injured and were transported by air to a level one trauma center. Both were hospitalized for treatment. The driver of V1 was fatally injured in the crash.
