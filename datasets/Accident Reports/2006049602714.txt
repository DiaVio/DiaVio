The crash occurred on a weekday late in the morning involving two passenger cars at an intersection with traffic lights. The speed limit for the roadway is 64 kph (40 mph). The road is a 4-lane divided (no positive barrier) concrete roadway for both vehicles. The intersection is located at an underpass. The road surface was wet however it had stopped raining just prior to the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1993 Geo Prizm with one occupant was traveling north in lane four of the northbound lanes attempting a left turn from the fourth lane of traffic at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), 2001 Dodge Neon with one occupant, was traveling south in the second lane, attempting to pass through an intersection. At the intersection, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. V1 rotated counter clockwise and moved to the south of the intersection. V1 departed the roadway to the east where the front right corner struck a concrete wall, which is part of the underpass. V1 moved along the wall for about 3 meters (10 feet) before it came to rest at the wall. V2 rotated clockwise after the first impact and moved south. It came to rest in the southbound lanes, facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 suffered non-incapacitating but severe injuries. He was transported and released. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

A 37-year old male drove V1, the 1993 Geo Prizm. He stated the protective left turn arrow was not illuminated when he started his left turn. He did stop at the intersection for about three seconds. He saw the oncoming traffic in lanes one and three stopped and decided to make his turn. He was heading home from a pawnshop where he had just purchased a birthday gift for his son. He was thinking of this up coming event just prior to the crash. The pawnshop is located about 400 meters (0.25 miles) south of the crash site. The driver provided a receipt from this pawnshop, showing the purchase of a stereo system and a remote controlled toy car found in the trunk of the vehicle. The receipt was from the day of the crash. The driver had major back surgery approximately 9 months prior and does not work. The driver of V1 said he looked to the north but did not see V2 approaching the intersection. At the time he made his turn V2 was coming at high speed from the north, passing the traffic still stopped at the light. The driver rarely drives the route but is familiar with the vehicle.

The witness, who assisted the researcher and police as an interpreter for the driver of V2, said he was the fourth vehicle at the stoplight. He said the southbound traffic had a green light, but did not say if the traffic was stopped or moving. The researcher observed the left turn light for V1 during scene inspection 24 hours later. The protected left turn arrow was illuminated after the entire northbound traffic had a green light. After that, the light for the southbound traffic turned red before the green left turn arrow was illuminated for about 3-4 seconds.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded "turning left at an intersection". The critical reason for the critical event was coded "inadequate surveillance." The driver proceeded with his left turn, despite the fact that he knew it was not protected by a left turn arrow. According to his own account he stopped at the intersection but decided to proceed with the left turn, based on the fact the oncoming traffic was still stopped. He did not pay attention to the unoccupied lane 2 and did not consider a vehicle could possibly approach the intersection without stopping. The stopped vehicles in lane three obstructed the driver's view of V2.

A 34-year old male drove V2, the 2001 Dodge Neon. The driver was heading to his work place from home. He said he was already late and had called his employer in advance to let him know he was late. He stated he was not in a hurry. He stated he had a green light and was traveling at about 54 kph (35 mph) in lane two when V1 came from his left side. He did not see V1 prior to entering the intersection. He did not say if the traffic in lanes one and three was stopped. The vehicles in lane three partially blocked his view of V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded "other vehicle encroachment-from opposite direction-over left lane line". No critical reason for the critical event was coded to this vehicle.
