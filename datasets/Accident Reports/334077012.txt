The vehicle rolled initially to the right and completed three quarter turns before coming to rest on its left side. The driver was removed from the vehicle through the windshield area and airlifted to a level one trauma center. He was hospitalized due to the severity of his injuries. The vehicle was towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
