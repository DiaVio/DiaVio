The case vehicle, a 2000 Honda Civic sedan, was westbound on a one-way two-lane roadway, approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 1995 Chevrolet Lumina sedan was in the inside northbound lane of a divided five-lane trafficway, approaching the same intersection. It was dawn, there were no adverse weather conditions and the roadway was dry. As the case vehicle was making a left turn into the southbound inside lane it crossed the path of V2 and was struck on the left door. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise before it came to rest straddling the north raised median island facing north. V2 came to rest in the outside northbound lane facing north. The case occupant is the unrestrained 24-year-old female driver. Her steering-wheel airbag deployed as a result of the impact. The driver was transported to a level-one trauma center.
