This two vehicle head-on crash occurred on a two lane, two way highway at night with no street lights and cloudy, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Kia Optima four door sedan was eastbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 GMC crew cab 2500 pickup truck was westbound and crossed over the centerline into the eastbound lane when the front of V2 impacted the front of V1. V2 then pushed V1 rearward post impact and V1 rotated clockwise 190 degrees and came to final rest facing west in the eastbound lane. V2 continued forward and rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest facing slightly northwest in the eastbound lane. Both vehicles were severely damage and had to be towed. The driver of V1 is the CIREN case occupant with a front right passenger also in V1. The case driver is a 67 year old male who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. This case occupant sustained multiple serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The front right passenger was belted with an air bag deployment and died on scene.
