This single vehicle crash occurred just past dawn during daylight hours on a two-lane dirt-gravel roadway with no lane markings in a rural area. The roadway curved left with a -4% grade and a super-elevation of 5%. The speed limit for the area is 40 kph (25 mph) with no adverse weather conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 GMC 4 door Yukon 4X4 SUV driven by a 35 year-old female with one passenger was traveling westbound and had just exited a left hand curve when the driver unintentionally accelerated instead of braking and began to fish-tail on the dirt-gravel roadway. V1 then departed the left road edge and became airborne for approximately 13 meters where it impacted a large oak tree with its front end . V1 came to rest in the area of impact. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.

The pre-event movement for V1 coded negotiating a curve, category this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. Critical reason driver related factor "poor directional control".

Associative factor, inattention talking to passenger.
