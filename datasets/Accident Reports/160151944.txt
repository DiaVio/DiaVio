This right-sided crash case involves a 13-year-old restrained male passenger with a deployed frontal air bag and curtain air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during nighttime hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred at the intersection of a five lane, two-way trafficway that runs east west and a three lane, two-way trafficway that runs north south. The case vehicle (V1), a 2006 Toyota Sienna minivan, was being driven westbound and was approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup truck, was being driven eastbound and was approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to make a left-hand turn at the intersection. While making the turn, the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. This contact caused the two vehicles to side slap. Both vehicles then came to rest in the southeast portion of the intersection. Vehicle one had additional contact before final rest with its left front tire striking a raised curb. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 42-year-old male who was restrained by the available lap and shoulder belt. The steering wheel mounted air bag deployed on the driver side. The case occupant was a 13-year-old male sitting in the right front seat. He was properly wearing the three-point lap and shoulder belt and had his frontal and curtain air bag deploy. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
