Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Lexus RX330 SUV, was traveling west in lane one of a two-lane, two-way roadway under snowy, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan, was traveling east in lane one of the same roadway. V1 lost control in the snow, crossing the center line, where the front of V2 contacted the front of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest off the roadway on the south side and V1 sustained a fire in the engine compartment. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. There were two occupants in V1, an 82-year-old male driver and a 79 year-old female right front passenger (and the case study occupant). Both occupants were properly wearing lap and shoulder belts and both frontal airbags and both pretensioners deployed in V1. In addition, the driver-side knee bolster airbag also deployed. Both the driver and passenger in V1 were transported to a hospital for treatment.
