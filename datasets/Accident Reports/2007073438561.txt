Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, was northbound in lane two. There were non-contact vehicles in front of V1 and entering the roadway from the entrance ramp. V1 changed lanes to the left and then traveled off the left side of the roadway. The front of V1 struck the jersey barrier. V1 then reentered the roadway rotating clockwise, crossed all lanes and traveled off the right side of the roadway. The front and then the left side struck the guardrail. V1 was towed due to damage.

The driver of V1, a twenty-two-year-old female, was on her way to work from her home. She was well rested, healthy and familiar with her vehicle. She travels this route daily. This driver stated that she was late for work and was driving "pretty fast, about 80 (mph, 129 kmph)." She changed lanes and "lost control." This driver further stated that she is stressed due to an adversarial relationship with her management at work.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the left side." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; aggressive driving behavior." This driver's speed, work stress and poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected) were associated factors in this crash.
