This case involved an unbelted female driver responding to a full frontal impact with a large pickup and air bag deployment. This crash occurred on the southbound side of an eight-lane, north/south interstate. There were four lanes for travel in each direction divided by a paved median protected by a concrete barrier. The southbound lanes had a gradual left curve and a positive grade. The weather was rainy and the concrete roadway was wet during the early morning (dark-not lit), weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer, 4-door sedan) was traveling southbound in the number four-lane (left) at a police reported 105 kmph, up the slight grade and negotiating the left curve. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts (front pretensioners) and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The 28-year-old female driver (subject/sole occupant) was not using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2002 Chevrolet Silverado pickup, unknown specific model) was sitting disabled in the median facing north, or, opposite the direction of traffic, due to a previous crash with another vehicle. The driver of V2 had exited the vehicle and was standing on the right side of it, between the vehicle and the center divider. The driver of V1 related that a vehicle had passed her on the right and had splashed water onto her windshield. She could not see and felt that her vehicle began to slide off of the roadway to the left. V1 departed the roadway, left, into the median and the front of V1struck the front of V2 in a full frontal, head-on configuration. V1's air bags deployed. The front end of V1 shifted upward and exhibited an under ride crush pattern. The impact pushed V2 rearward where it struck the other disabled vehicle from the previous crash and the concrete center divider, trapping the V2 driver/pedestrian between V2's right side and the center divider. V1 continued forward and came to rest facing V2 (southbound) in the median.
