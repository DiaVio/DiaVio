This case involved a 22 year old restrained female driver of a 2009 Hyundai Accent two-door hatchback (V1). The crash was a head on collision with a 2008 Mack truck with one trailer which was hauling coal. The driver of V1 was the only occupant and was restrained by the three-point lap and shoulder belts and a deployed frontal airbag. The side impact airbags and the side head curtain airbags did not deploy in the crash. The crash occurred on a two-lane rural roadway during daylight hours. The asphalt roadway was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions. V1 was traveling south coming out of a left hand curve on a -5% down grade at approximately 40 kph (25 mph). V2 was going north on a straight section of the roadway with a positive 5% uphill grade. V2 was reportedly traveling about 24 kph (15 mph). The posted speed limit for this roadway was 72 kph (45 mph). A non-contact vehicle, traveling in the northbound lane, was slowing to turn right into a private driveway. V2 traveling some distance behind the non-contact vehicle, swerved into the southbound lane to pass the non-contact vehicle. The front of V2 impacted the front of V1, pushing V1 rearward. The rear bumper of V1 impacted the pavement as V1 was being pushed backwards. V1 came to rest still in the southbound lane. V2 traveled off the west side of the roadway to final rest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 sustained severe injuries in the crash and was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center where she was hospitalized for treatment.
