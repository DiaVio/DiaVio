The case subject is a restrained 80 year old female right front passenger in a 2013 Kia Soul (V1). The driver of V1 was a restrained 83 year old male. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side airbags, and dual side curtains. The frontal steering wheel mounted and frontal right top instrument panel mounted airbags were the only airbags to deploy during the crash. V2, a 2005 Chevrolet Malibu was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a two-way, two-lane curved roadway. The westbound lane of the roadway curved right and had an uphill slope. The eastbound lane of the roadway curved to the left and had a downhill slope. The posted speed limit for both lanes was 40 kph (25 mph). It was raining at the time of the crash and the asphalt roadway was wet due to the rain. V1 was traveling west in the westbound lane of the roadway. V2 was traveling east in the eastbound lane. The driver of V2 was negotiating a sharp left curve when V2 began to slide toward the right roadside. The driver of V2 then steered left in an attempt to regain control of V2. This maneuver caused V2 to drift left while in a counterclockwise rotation. V2 crossed the center lane line into opposing lane. As V2 entered the westbound lane, its right front door was contacted by the front of V1. This initial impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise. The rotation of both vehicles caused the right rear of V2 to contact the left rear of V1. Both vehicles came to rest in the westbound lane facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The passenger of V1 was taken to a level one trauma center after sustaining a serious injury. There she was treated for injuries that she sustained in the crash.
