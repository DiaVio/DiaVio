The crash occurred on a two-way, two-lane, undivided roadway. This was a straight, level, asphalt street, with a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph). The crash happened in a non-junction area, with no traffic controls. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1995 Chevy Corvette with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane one. V2, an unoccupied 2006 Ford F350, was parked along the right roadside. The driver of V1 veered off the roadway. The front right corner of V1 struck the wheel well area of the left rear quarter panel of V2. This caused V1 to spontaneously roll to the left two quarter turns. V1 ended up on its roof, facing south, straddled between lanes one and two. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1 and 48 kmph for V2.

The Chevy Corvette was driven by a 74-year old male, who was transported to the hospital with injuries. The driver had no recollection of the events leading up to the crash. At the driver's request, the researcher contacted the driver's family to notify them of the crash. The family indicated that the driver had recently started drinking again, after several years of sobriety. The family stated that the driver had been drinking just before the crash, which was consistent with evidence found inside the driver's vehicle. During the later part of the interview, the driver himself revealed that he had been drinking prior to the crash.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side". The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an unknown driver related error. One associated factor for this driver was non-performance related. Specifically, the driver had been drinking. No other associated factors could be determined, due to the driver's inability to recall any crash related details.
