This crash occurred in the late morning of a weekday on northern roadside of a 3-lane east/west undivided roadway. The roadway was composed of two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. The bituminous roadway was dry, straight, and level with a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1987 Chevy Caprice four-door with one occupant, was westbound in lane one. As V1 continued westbound it veered right, departed the roadway and struck a small mailbox with its front. V1 continued westbound, across an intersecting roadway and departed the roadway again where it struck a utility pole (30 cm in diameter) on the northwest corner of the intersection with the two-lane, north/south, intersecting roadway. V1 came to final rest facing northwest about a meter east of the pole approximately 33m (108 ft.) from the first impact. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a 27-year old unlicensed male, was coded for possible injury but was not transported to a hospital. He appeared dazed to the researcher when approached on-scene. He spoke briefly and said that he was traveling westbound and thought he had a seizure and blacked out. He told the researcher that he did not have a history of seizures. He said he had to leave but added that the researcher could call him later. He gave the researcher and the police the same wrong phone number and address making further contact impossible.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver related, other physical impairment (the seizure and blackout). Due to the inability of the researcher to complete the interview the where no other associated factors that could be coded to this driver.
