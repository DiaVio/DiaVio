The case occupant is a 34 year old unbelted male driver involved in a moderate frontal corner impact with a frontal impact air bag deployment who sustained serious injuries. This two vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane, two way north/south roadway, with dry travel lanes and clear weather conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the asphalt travel lanes are straight and have an uphill grade for northbound vehicles. There are paved shoulders on both sides of the roadway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Toyota 4Runner four door large utility vehicle, was traveling north in the northbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a metro bus, was traveling south in the southbound lane. V1 crossed the double yellow center lane lines and V1's front left impacted the front left of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. After striking V2, V1 was overpowered rearward by V2's size, rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in lane one, facing west. After the impact, V2 continued in a southerly direction and came to final rest in the southbound lane, facing south. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 34 year old male driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed during the crash. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
