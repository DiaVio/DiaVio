Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Dodge Intrepid, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the left westbound through lane of a 6-lane, divided-unprotected road (three lanes eastbound, painted median, two lanes westbound, one right turn lane) and was approaching a 4-leg intersection with a crossing 5-lane divided highway (two lanes northbound, one right turn lane, two lanes outhbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2007 Chevrolet transit bus was traveling north in the right northbound through-lane and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy and the asphalt road surface was dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique, head-on manner. The impact caused V1 to rapidly rotate in a clockwise manner and the left side of V1 struck the right side of V2 in a sideslap type configuration. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 89-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 84-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.
