The case vehicle, a 2002 Volvo V40 station wagon, was eastbound on a two-lane roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a four-door 1998 Chevrolet Malibu was westbound on the same roadway with 2.1% down grade. V2 drifted into the west distress lane and rode up onto a mountable curb. The driver of V2 attempted to steer back into the westbound lane, but over-corrected and lost control of the vehicle. V2 crossed the center line and entered the path of the case vehicle. The front of V2 struck the front of the case vehicle at an oblique angle in an off-set frontal mode. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise into the east distress lane and strike a guardrail with its right fender. V2 rotated counterclockwise and struck the left quarter-panel of the case vehicle with the corner of its right-rear bumper. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 58-year-old female driver was restrained by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
