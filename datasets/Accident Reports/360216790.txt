This case occupant is a 50 year old female driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a single vehicle frontal crash with a frontal impact air bag deployment and who sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred during early morning hours in darkness with overhead street lights, clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser four door hatchback, was eastbound, approaching a T-type intersection, in lane one of a two lane, two way, asphalt roadway. V1 was on a slightly downhill grade when it traveled into the intersection and departed the roadway over the east curb. V1 traveled a short distance off the roadway and the front of V1 impacted concrete steps, resulting in the deployment of both frontal air bags. V1 ramped up the steps, causing it to bounce-over. V1 completed two quarter turns to its left and came to final rest on its top on the sidewalk. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 50 year old female, who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
