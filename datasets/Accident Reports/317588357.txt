This case involved an unrestrained 56 year old female driver in a 2006 Buick Lucerne (V1). V1 was equipped with dual side curtains, dual frontal airbags, and dual side airbags. The driver's frontal airbag was the only airbag to deploy during the crash. There were no other vehicles or occupants involved in the crash. V1 was traveling westbound in lane two of a four-lane, asphalt roadway that had a negative slope. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a clear day. The posted speed limit was (64 kph) 40 mph. While V1 was traveling in lane two of the roadway, the driver blacked out due to a medical condition. This caused V1 to drift left into lane one and then off the roadway where it contacted a pole with its front. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest at the pole facing southwest. The impact caused shearing damage to the pole. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground to a level one trauma center where she received treatment for moderate injuries that she sustained during the crash.
