This crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a divided interstate roadway. The six southbound lanes were bituminous and straight, with an uphill slope of more than two percent. The posted speed was 105 kmph (65 mph). Conditions were dark but lighted, on a weekday evening. The roadway was wet, with light intermittent rainfall. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 2006 Ford Mustang convertible, was traveling in the exit lane (lane one). V2, a 1993 Geo Prizm, was traveling in front of V1. V3, a 1997 Chevy Malibu, was traveling ahead of V2. Traffic in that lane started to back up. V3 slowed down to almost a stop. V2 slowed down behind V3. V1 failed to stop in time. The front of V1 made contact with the back of V2. Consequently, the front of V2 made contact with the back of V3. V1 was towed due to damage. There were no injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 was driven by a 38-year old male. He stated that he was on his way with his daughter to a football game. He was getting off at the exit to check into his hotel first before heading to the game. He said that V2 moved from an adjacent lane between him and V3, and then slowed suddenly due to traffic ahead. The driver indicated that he applied his brakes, but could not stop in time. The reason, he commented, was partially due to the gap distance and partially due to the wet pavement.
