Case # 2006-04-04

The crash occurred off the right side of a two-lane roadway with a T-intersection. Conditions were dry with daylight in the afternoon on a weekday. The posted speed limit was 72 KMPH (45 MPH). Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was a 2005 Pontiac Vibe SUV traveling northbound in the 1st travel lane approaching a T-intersection intending on going straight. An unknown vehicle was traveling southbound in the 1st travel lane approaching the same T-intersection intending on turning left. V1 swerved right to avoid contact with the unknown vehicle and lost control. V1 departed the right side of the roadway and struck an embankment then a tree. V1 came to final rest facing eastbound.

V1 was driven by a 22-year-old female who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital. She stated that she was traveling northbound when the unknown vehicle turned left in front of her vehicle. The driver of v1 swerved right to avoid a collision when she lost control of her vehicle. V1 was traveling between 41-50 MPH at the time of impact. V1 was towed due to damage.

The critical precrash event for V1 was the other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical precrash event was a driver decision error, too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. Associated factors coded to this driver were insufficient steering inputs and overcompensation.
