This case focuses on an unrestrained driver in a 2008 Toyota Tacoma pickup (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags in which the driver's airbag deployed. V2, a 2004 Mercury Mountaineer compact utility vehicle and V3, a 2013 Buick Lacrosse four-door sedan were also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during nighttime hours on a dark road. The roadway had two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane. The travel lanes were asphalt and wet due to a rain shower at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph) for both directions of travel. V1 was traveling west in the westbound travel lane. V2 was traveling in lane one of the eastbound lanes heading east. V3 was traveling in lane two of the eastbound lanes heading east. The driver of V2 steered left in an attempt to enter lane two of the eastbound lanes. The left rear of V2 contacted the right front of V3. This impact caused the driver of V2 to lose control sending V2 across the center lane line while in a counterclockwise yaw into the westbound lane. The front of V1 contacted the right side of V2. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest on the roadside adjacent to the westbound lane. V1 faced southeast at final rest. V2 rotated clockwise after impact and came to rest on the roadside adjacent to the westbound lanes facing east. V3 continued traveling after impact and was driven to final rest onto the roadside adjacent to the eastbound lanes, facing east. V1 and V2 were towed due to disabling damage. V3 sustained minor damage and was not towed. The driver of V1 was transported by ground to a local hospital; however, he was later transferred to a level one trauma center where he received treatment for the serious injuries that he sustained.
