This case involved a belted driver responding to an off-set frontal impact with another passenger vehicle with frontal impact air bags and driver seat back mounted head and torso side impact air bag deployment. This crash occurred on a level, multi-lane north/south trafficway. There were two lanes for travel in each direction separated by a painted median. The northbound approach to the crash site was straight leading into a right curve. There was an incidental three-way intersection just south of the crash site where a four lane, divided, interstate entrance/exit ramp access adjoined from the west and was controlled by tri-color traffic signals. The southbound approach had a single southbound lane that transitioned into two in the midst of a sweeping left curve. The lanes were separated from the two northbound lanes by painted yellow lines. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the evening (dark, street lights), weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1), a 2004 Subaru Forrester 4-door station wagon, was traveling northbound in the number-one (right) lane. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, driver and passenger frontal impact air bags and seat back mounted head and torso side impact air bags. The 38-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as evidenced by friction burns to the D-ring from occupant loading. The opposing vehicle (V2), a 2004 Toyota Tacoma pickup, was traveling southbound at a high speed, negotiating the left curve, where the single lane transitioned into two lanes. There were two occupants of V2. The driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle while steering left and the vehicle began a long counterclockwise yaw, which carried it across the center divider, into the northbound lanes and into the path of V1. At impact, V2 was at an angle facing V1 and the front left of V2 struck the front left of V1. V1's driver and passenger frontal impact air bags deployed. The front center, and then right of V2's bumper rotated into the left side of V1 as V2 raked down its side. V1's driver seat back mounted head and torso side impact air bag deployed. The vehicles separated and V1's counterclockwise rotation increased as it was deflected off of the right side of the roadway. V1's right rear struck a cement filled post and then an electrical utility box, which were both knocked down. V1 came to rest as it struck down the utility box facing west. V2 continued rotating counterclockwise (approximately 290-degrees) as it slid into the adjacent intersection where it came to rest facing south in the northbound left turn lane. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (subject) was transported to a trauma facility with "A" injuries as rated by police. The occupants of V2 were transported with "B" injuries as rated by police.
