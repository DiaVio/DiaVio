The driver was interviewed some time after the crash, and she stated that she had just re-started the engine after it had stalled, and when she made the turn the steering wheel wouldn't turn, she went on to state that she applied the brakes and skid into Vehicle 2.

The researcher spoke with the passenger of vehicle 1 briefly on scene. She said the driver told her that she didn't know what happened. The police officer on scene told the researcher that the driver told him that she panicked and confused the accelerator with the brake pedal. Given the lack of physical evidence and the configuration of the scene, the researcher coded the critical reason based on the driver's statement to the police officer.
