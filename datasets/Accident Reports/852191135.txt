This frontal crash case involves a 75 year old female front row right passenger, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained moderate injuries. This crash occurred in darkness, during rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. In the area where the crash occurred, the roadway is comprised of one north and one southbound travel lane with paved shoulders and no curbs. In the pre-crash area, the northbound lane is initially straight with a slight uphill grade. As the roadway continues north, it widens to include a left-turn lane for northbound vehicles. The roadway then begins a ninety degree curve to the right. In this section of the curve, there is a concrete jersey barrier located on the southbound shoulder. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Pontiac Sunfire two-door coupe, was traveling north in lane one, failed to negotiate the right curve, crossed over the left turn and southbound travel lanes and departed the roadway to the left. The front of V1 struck a wooden signpost, shearing it from its base. The signpost then impacted the top of V1, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued a short distance north and the front left of V1 impacted a concrete jersey barrier, resulting in the deployment of both of the frontal air bags. V1 rotated clockwise and its left side struck the jersey barrier, resulting in minor damage. V1 came to final rest off the roadway, parallel to the jersey barrier, facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 75 year old female in the front right seating position who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed. She sustained moderate injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The driver of V1 was a 20 year old female who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the third crash event. She was not injured in the crash.
