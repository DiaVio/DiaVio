This two-vehicle intersection crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Honda Civic two door coupe was stopped northbound on two way, two lane street and began to cross the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck was eastbound on the two lane highway with a center left turn lane at the intersection and was traveling straight through the intersection. V2 then swerved to the left slightly just before the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. V2 then forced V1 laterally to the east side of the intersection and then locked up the brakes to final rest facing northeast and in the westbound left turn lane. V1 then separated from V2 and rolled to final rest facing northwest in the eastbound lane. Both vehicle were damaged and had to be towed. The CIREN case occupant is the driver of V1, a 16 year old male who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder safety belt. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being airlifted to the trauma center. No other passengers were in V1.
