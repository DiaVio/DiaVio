Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Toyota Tacoma Pickup, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, dark conditions. V1 was negotiating a curve to the left when it departed the roadway to the right, striking a tree with its front and then rotating clockwise where it struck a telephone pole with its left. V1 came to final rest after the impact with the pole. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1 and the case study occupant was a 19-year-old male that was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt. Both frontal airbags deployed in V1. The driver of V1 was transported to a level one-trauma center for treatment.
