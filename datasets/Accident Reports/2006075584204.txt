This single vehicle crash occurred on a divided four-lane state highway. The highway is right curved, downhill and bituminous with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). It was very dark on a weekday night and the road did not have overhead lighting. The road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic was moderate.

V1 (Vehicle one), a 2002 Audi Allroad four-door wagon with one occupant, was in lane two negotiating the right curve. A non-contact vehicle that was traveling the opposite direction flashed their headlights at her. She looked down at the speedometer and noticed she was traveling 84 kmph (52 mph). As she looked back up, she saw an elk in the roadway. She stated she did not have time to avoid hitting it. V1 came to final rest on the right hand shoulder of the roadway facing southwest. The vehicle was towed from the scene due to moderate frontal damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

A 36 year-old female drove V1. She stated she went shopping in another city and was driving home. She was treated at the scene for minor injuries. The driver stated she drives this road three to four times a week and never did feel comfortable driving it at night because of the very dark roadway. She was very comfortable with her vehicle.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded "Animal in the roadway." The Critical Pre-Crash Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was coded "driver related factor, Internal distraction". Failure to look far enough ahead and the external distraction of the non-contact vehicle flashing its lights were contributing factors in this crash.
