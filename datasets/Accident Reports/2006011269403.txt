V1, a 1998 Chevrolet Lumina 4dr, was traveling west on a straight, level, rural, two-lane, two-way, gravel/slag roadway. It was daylight, cloudy and the roadway was ice covered. V1 lost control, rotated counter-clockwise and slid off the road to the left. It continued to rotate counter-clockwise , overturning left side leading, one quarter turn onto it's left side where it came to rest facing north. The driver was not transported. V1 was towed.

The driver stated that she was on her way home from work and did not realize the surface of the road was frozen. She said she began to feel the car slipping and began to "pump the brakes even though I knew I had ABS brakes". She stated that she never was sure what to do with anti-lock brakes. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The Critical Pre-crash Event was this vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions and the Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was too fast for conditions - icy roads. Some factors contributing to her loss of control were the ice-covered roadway, traveling too fast for conditions (did not realize that caution was required), her choice of inappropriate/unsuccessful evasive action (her wrong use of ABS).
