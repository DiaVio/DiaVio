Vehicle One (V1), a 2002 Saturn SL1 sedan, was traveling south out of a parking lot preparing to make a left turn onto a six lane, trafficway divided by a curbed median under dry, dark conditions. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2003 Ford F150 pickup truck, was traveling west in lane three of a four lane roadway that is part of a six lane, divided trafficway. V1 attempted to make a left turn and the front of V2 contacted the left side of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case study occupant, a 21-year-old female was the driver and sole occupant in V1. She was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
