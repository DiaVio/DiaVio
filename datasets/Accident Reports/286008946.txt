This case involves a moderate offset frontal impact event resulting in serious injuries to the left-rear case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Lexus GS300, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. The roadway was winding with gradual curves to the right and to the left. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the bituminous (asphalt) road was dry. The driver of V1 had just negotiated a curve to the right and was entering a curve to the left when he reportedly fell asleep and departed the right side of the road. The driver also reported that he awoke prior to impact and attempted to steer left. The front of V1 struck a tree and came to rest against the tree. The 31-year-old male driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was not injured and did not seek medical treatment. The 2-year-old female left-rear passenger (case occupant) was seated in a forward-facing child seat that was attached to the vehicle using the available three-point seat belt and the child was restrained by the CSS with 5-point harness. The child appeared uninjured and was not transported from the scene. Within the hours following the crash, the child had difficulty ambulating and was brought to a pediatric trauma center a few hours post-crash.
