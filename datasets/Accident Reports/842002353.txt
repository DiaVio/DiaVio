This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 26 year old female driver, and unrestrained 28 year old female front right passenger of a 2002 Ford Explorer XLS 4-door 4x4 sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a split-tree bole (event #3). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a multi-lane divided interstate highway. The north and southbound lanes were divided by a wooded median area. It was dark (not lighted), with rainy conditions as the roadway was wet. The police reported standing water on the asphalt road surface due to excessive/prolonged rain. V1 was initially traveling in the center southbound lane when the driver attempted to change lanes to the left. As V1 changed lanes, the vehicle began a clockwise rotation and subsequently departed the left (east) pavement edge. V1 entered the center median, and the left front wheel struck a downed tree trunk (event #1) resulting in moderate damage. The left side surface sideswiped multiple tree branches (event #2), which resulted in minor damage. At this point, the front left area impacted a split-tree bole (3 trunks/same base) resulting in moderate damage. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in close proximity to the final point of impact (in the center median) facing southeast. The driver and front right passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The unrestrained rear right male passenger (unknown age) was reported by police as uninjured. The restrained 9 year old female rear center passenger, and unrestrained rear left male passenger (unknown age) were transported to a local medical facility with non-incapacitating injuries (level of treatment unknown). Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
