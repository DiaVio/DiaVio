This case occupant is a 26 year old male driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt who was involved in a single vehicle rollover crash with side air bag and curtain deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during pre-dawn hours on a two lane, two way state freeway with no overhead street lights. In the driver's precrash area, there is one east and one westbound travel lane, with a left curve for eastbound traffic. There are no shoulders or curbs. Adjacent to the south side of the roadway is a grassy area that slopes away from the travel lanes, leading to a wooded area. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear with dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan, was traveling east in lane one. As the driver of V1 was negotiating the curve, he lost control of the vehicle and began to go into a counterclockwise yaw. V1 departed the roadway to the right and continued in a yaw until it tripped-over a downed tree and began to rollover to the right. V1 completed two quarter turns while striking two trees with its top and upper left side, resulting in the deployment of the left side air bag and left curtain. V1 rotated counterclockwise off the trees and continued to roll onto its left side, striking another tree with its left front. V1 came to final rest on its left side, off the roadway, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 26 year old male, was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and sustained serious injuries. His seat back mounted side air bag and roof side rail mounted side curtain deployed during the crash. He was transported to an outside hospital and was discharged home. He later returned to the outside hospital and was transferred to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
