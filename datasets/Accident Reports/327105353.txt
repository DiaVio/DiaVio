This case involves a moderate impact to the left fender of a compact SUV. The collision partner was a large SUV. The case occupant is the 64-year-old female driver of the compact SUV. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case vehicle, a 2004 Honda CR-V SUV, was westbound in the through lane of a dry, level, asphalt, three-lane road, approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 2008 Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV, was westbound in the lane ahead of the case vehicle approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. V2 slowed to make a left-turn, and the driver of the case vehicle attempted to steer right to go around V2. The left fender of the case vehicle struck the right-rear corner of V2. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise and roll right-side leading one-quarter turn. The case vehicle came to rest on side facing north. The 64-year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle. She was restrained by a three-point belt, and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was taken to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
