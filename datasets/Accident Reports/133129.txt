Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle) a 2006 Honda Civic, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural dirt roadway and was approaching a four-leg intersection that was controlled by stop signs for the east- and westbound traffic. V1 was traversing a negative slope and the mouth of the intersection was paved with asphalt. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Mercury Mountaineer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way asphalt roadway. It was dark, the sky was cloudy and the road surfaces were dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. After the initial impact, V1 was re-directed in a north-westerly direction and was rotating in a counterclockwise manner. The right-rear quarter panel of V1 then struck a W-beam guardrail before V1 came to final rest. After the initial impact, V2 continued in a northerly direction and was slightly rotated in a counterclockwise manner. V2 came to rest in the center of the road facing north-northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 17-year-old female driver (case occupant) of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt, in addition, the seatback-mounted pelvic & torso air bag and roofrail-mounted curtain air bag deployed but the steering-wheel air bag did not. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (MAIS-4) injuries.
