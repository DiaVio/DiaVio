Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 70-year-old female driver of a 2011 Buick Lucerne 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a frontal collision with a ditch/culvert. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight), of a fall weekday, on a five lane southbound roadway, of a north/south trafficway, at the area of an interchange. This roadway is straight and level, with a speed limit of 55 mph (89 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2011 Buick Lucerne 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 70-year-old female driver (case occupant), in the right southbound travel lane, approaching the interchange area from the north. The driver of Vehicle 1 was unbelted, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: As Vehicle 1 approached from the north, it drifted off the right side of the roadway. At this time, it struck a ditch/culvert (with embankment) with its frontal plane (bumper and below). Vehicle 1 came to rest at or near the area of impact, facing a southwesterly direction. As a result of the frontal impact, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
