This left-sided crash involves a 24-year-old restrained male with no air bag deployment who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in wet, rainy conditions. The collision occurred on a two lane, two-way roadway near a curve in the roadway. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2003 Toyota Camry sedan traveling west on the roadway. The crash occurred when V1, while negotiating a right curve, departed the roadway to the left with his left tires. The driver of V1 steered right to re-enter the roadway and at this time V1 began to rotate clockwise. V1 then crossed over the roadway and departed the roadway to the right, where it struck a tree with its left side. V1 came to rest off the roadway to the right and was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 24-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point manual belt. No airbags deployed. The case occupant was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
