This single-vehicle crash occurred on a divided five-lane state highway. The westbound roadway is curved to the right, divided by a painted median with two through lanes and the beginning of one right turn lane. The roadway is downhill with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). This crash occurred during nighttime hours on a dark roadway.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Ford Explorer, four-door, with four occupants was westbound in lane two, negotiating the curve. An Elk entered the roadway from the right and entered lane two. The driver applied the ABS brakes just before impact with the Elk. After the impact, V1 entered lane one and partially ran off the right side of the roadway and came to rest on its wheels facing west. V1 was towed from the scene with moderate frontal damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a fifty-two year old male, was driving from watching fireworks at a park to his house. He and his wife, the right front seat passenger, were telling to the children in the backseat to go to sleep prior to recognition of the crash. He was well rested having had the day off, drives this roadway a couple times a week and is very familiar with the vehicle. He has allergies, but was not suffering with them that day. He does, however, take Lisinopril and wears reading glasses when he reads.

The pre-crash event for V1 was coded: object or animal, animal in roadway. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).
