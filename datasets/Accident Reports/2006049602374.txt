This two-car crash occurred at an intersection with traffic lights. The South to North section of the road is a 4-lane divided (eight lanes overall) asphalt roadway. The area of the intersection was a construction area. Lane three and lane four (left turn lane) of the south-north roadway was closed. Lane two was used as left turn only lane. The roadway north of the intersection was partially under construction. The road surface was concrete. Lanes two and three had been torn up for resurfacing and were completely blocked at the time of the crash. The East to West section of the road is comprised of three-lanes (lane one is wide enough for two vehicles), with five asphalt travel lanes overall. The speed limit is 48 kmph (30 mph) for both roadways. During the time of the crash, a city repair crew was working on the intersections traffic lights. The lights were flashing red at the time prior to the crash. The road surface was dry and there were no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

It was late afternoon on a weekday and there was regular traffic on the roadways. Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Jeep Cherokee with four doors and one occupant was traveling north in the first lane of traffic approaching the intersection of both roadways. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Nissan Altima with four doors and one occupant, was traveling west in the first lane. The driver of V1 stopped at the flashing red light, checked for cross traffic, accelerated and proceeded northbound into the intersection. While V1 was still within the intersection, the traffic signal for westbound traffic turned green for V2 and the vehicle proceeded into the intersection. At the intersection of both roadways, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1. V1 rotated clockwise and started to roll over. V1 rolled over one quarter turn onto its left side. It came to rest within the northbound lanes of traffic, facing northwest. V2 slightly rotated clockwise after the impact, and moved northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Neither driver was injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The investigating officer spoke with a public works employee who was at the scene working on the traffic control box. He stated the lights were initially flashing red and he switched it back to alternating red, amber, green, and immediately after that he heard the crash.

A 47-year old male drove V1, the 1995 Jeep Cherokee. He was partially interviewed at the scene. He was heading home from work on a route he rarely uses. He was not in a hurry, does not take any medication and was in good health. He was convinced V2 ran a red light by disregarding the flashing lights. The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path. No critical reason for the critical event was coded to this vehicle.

V2, the 1997 Nissan Altima was driven by a 36-year old male, who reported no injuries. He could not be reached for an interview. The critical pre crash event for V2 was coded: this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) an intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V2 as an environmental factor: sign/signal erroneous/defective. In adequate surveillance was also considered a factor for V2 because the driver failed to look to the side and observe V1's presence.
