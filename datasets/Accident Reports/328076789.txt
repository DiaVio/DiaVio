This case involves a 50 year old female restrained by the available 3-point manual belt and a deployed frontal airbag. She was the driver and only occupant of a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab rear wheel drive pickup truck. The case subject sustained serious injuries as a result of the crash. The crash occurred on a dry asphalt two-lane rural roadway during daylight hours. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The case vehicle was traveling east at approximately 35 mph (56 kmp) in a area where the road curved slightly to the right and there was an uphill grade of 3%. Due to a medical condition, the driver relinquished control of the vehicle at which time the vehicle traveled over the center line and departed the left road edge. The vehicle sideswiped a wooden utility pole beginning at the center of the left front door and extending all the way rearward. The vehicle then traveled down a 12% slope to impact two trees, the first tree being small with an 8 cm diameter and the second larger tree measuring 34 cm in diameter. The impacts with the trees involved the left front bumper corner and extended 27 cm to the right. The case vehicle rotated approximately 45 degrees counterclockwise before coming to rest and was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver was airlifted from the scene and taken directly to a level one trauma center where she was treated and admitted due to the severity of her injuries.
