This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 67 year old female seated in the front left seating position (Driver) with a deployed frontal and knee bolster air bag who sustained moderate injuries. The crash occurred in the evening hours (dark, no street lights) in dry and clear weather within the confines of a 3-legged intersection. The asphalt north/south traffic way consisted of one northbound lane (curved to the left) and two southbound lanes (one straight and one right turn). Both of the north/south lanes were separated by a double yellow line. The third leg (located on the west side) of the intersection consists of one west and one east level asphalt travel lane. The point of impact occurred approximately in the middle of the intersection at the hill crest. The posted speed limit at the crash site was 35 mph (56 km/h). The case vehicle (V1), a 2009 four-door Toyota Camry was being driven northbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 four-door Volvo S60 was traveling southbound in the straight lane. As V1 entered the 3-legged intersection and began to execute a left turn, the front of V1 impacted with the front of V2. The exact location of the direct damage on V1 can be identified by the imprint of the V2's front license plate on V1's front right bumper. After initial impact V1 rotated counter clockwise 140 degrees before traveling to its final resting position in the southwest quadrant of the intersection facing south. After initial impact, V2 rotated clockwise (approximately 25 degrees) before traveling to its final resting position off the road edge in the southwest quadrant of the intersection. V1 and V2 were both towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by a 67year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag and the driver's knee bolster air bag both deployed as a result of the frontal crash. This case occupant's seat track was positioned at middle and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was moderately injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground transportation for treatment of her injuries.
