Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Ford F250 Superduty, 4-door pickup was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Saturn SL2, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same road. It was daylight, cloudy, and the asphalt road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V2 crossed the centerline and into the path of V1. The driver of V1 was not able to take any avoidance maneuvers and the front of V1 struck and overrode the front of V2. The impact caused V1 to rotate counter clockwise, trip over its right side wheels and come to rest in the right paved shoulder . V1's final rest was on it's right side facing south-southwest. V2 reportedly came to rest slightly west of the impact location facing east. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 21-year-old male driver of V2 was pronounced dead at the scene. The 50-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with multiple moderate (AIS-2) injuries.
