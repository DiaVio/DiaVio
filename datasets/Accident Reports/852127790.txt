V2 sustained contact with V1 to final rest facing slightly southwest in the eastbound lane. Both vehicles were towed and V2 had to be pulled off of V1. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only occupant in V1. The case driver was 22 year old female who was wearing the lap and shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed on impact.
