This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 25-year old female belted driver with a deployed airbag. She sustained serious injuries in a multi-event crash including frontal and rollover impacts. She was found by EMS still belted in her seat, upside down. Her dog was ejected either through the windshield or right front window. The crash occurred midafternoon on a clear dry road. A 2009 Chevrolet Impala full-size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling north negotiating a right curve. The rural bituminous two-way, two-lane road had a minimal downhill grade. The curve was superelevated +8%. As V1 was negotiating the right curve, it traveled left across the center line. V1 returned to its original lane skidding laterally in a clockwise yaw. V1 departed the right side of the road and struck an embankment with its front plane (Event 1). The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise 40 degrees before rolling left (Event 2). V1 rolled 2.5 full turns on the east shoulder before coming to rest on its top plane, facing the opposite direction of initial travel. V1's final rest was on the east shoulder an estimated 47 meters from the initial rollover point. V1 was towed due to damage, which was severe. The 25-year-old female belted driver was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The steering wheel hub airbag was deployed. The available right front, side seatback, and curtain airbags were not deployed. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance with serious injuries.
