This severe frontal crash involved a restrained 21 year old male driver that sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a curve on a two lane, two way north/south highway bordered by paved shoulders. On the west side of the highway is a soft dirt ditch. At the time of the crash it was dry, with overcast weather conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Honda Civic four door sedan, was traveling northbound on a highway that has a slight uphill grade and curves to the right. Vehicle two (V2), an International semi tractor pulling a single trailer, was southbound with a slight downhill grade and was negotiating the curve to the left. V1 continued straight into the curve and crossed the center line into the southbound lane. The driver of the semi truck swerved to the right to avoid a full head on crash and the front left corner of V1 impacted the front left corner of V2. V1 then rotated counterclockwise down the left side of V2 and the front of V1 swiped the left side of V2. V1 continued to rotate counterclockwise two complete revolutions while traveling across the northbound lane and then came to final rest facing north on the east paved shoulder. After the first crash event, V2's brakes locked up. The tractor began to rotate counterclockwise and the rear trailer left skid marks on the pavement as it departed the roadway into the soft dirt. V2 came to final rest jack-knifed with the tractor cab facing east in the southbound lane, and the trailer facing slightly southeast in the ditch. Both vehicles were damaged and towed from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant. He is a 21 year old male and was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and his seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated on impact. The front steering column, the side seatback, and the roof side rail mounted airbags all deployed on impact. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported and hospitalized at the trauma center.
