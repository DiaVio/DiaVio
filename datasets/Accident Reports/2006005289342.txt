This crash occurred in the late evening of a weekday in the northbound lane of a two-lane undivided roadway. The north/south roadway consisted of one lane in each direction lighted by street lamps. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight with a positive grade and a posted speed limit of 72kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 2004 Nissan Quest, was northbound on the roadway approaching an intersection. V2, a Chevrolet 2500 pick-up, was stopped ahead of V1 in the northbound lane as traffic stopped for the intersection. V1 failed to stop and its front struck the back of V2. After the impact, both vehicles continued forward slightly before coming to final rest in the northbound lane near the point of impact. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage while, V2 was driven from the scene prior to the researcher's arrival. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a 34 year-old female, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the impact. Of the three other occupants in the vehicle, only the front right passenger had possible injuries, but did not require transport for treatment. The driver stated that she noticed her brakes making a funny noise in the week preceding the crash. On the day of the crash, she claimed to have attempted to hit the brakes upon noticing the vehicle stopped in front of her. After doing so, she claimed that she could not stop in time and made contact with the rear of V2. Through evidence at the scene and information relayed by the officer, it was determined that brake failure was not the cause of this crash. The driver was taking prescription medication to help alleviate symptoms of depression. A blood alcohol test was performed and the driver was determined to have a BAC of .14 (she was charge with driving under the influence).

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped. The Critical Reason was coded as a driver related error, an unknown recognition error. Associated factors include the presence of alcohol in the driver's system combined with depression medication as well as insufficient braking inputs.

The driver of V2, a 35 year-old male, did not suffer any injuries as a result of the crash. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred and the vehicle was driven from the scene. An interview with this driver could not be obtained, as the driver could not be located after numerous attempts.
