This single-vehicle rollover crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane roadway with various curves and elevations. The southbound lane curves right then straightens out and is downhill. Guard rails borders both lanes for a portion of the roadway. The speed limit for the area is 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred mid-afternoon during daylight during heavy rain and with water accumulation on the roadway.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 F-250 pickup, was southbound traveling 89 kmph (55 mph) when it lost traction and slid into the guardrail on the right side of the roadway. The right side plane of V1 contacted the guardrail for 25 meters (82 feet) then rotated clockwise before departing the right road edge onto the muddy shoulder. V1 then rolled 4 quarter turns across the shoulder and up an embankment where its rear left side plane contacted a mesquite bush. V1 came to rest on its wheels facing northwest and was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The driver, a fifty three (53) year-old female, stated the rain came suddenly and was very heavy. She felt the truck slide and she tried to steer left and right with no success. Tread depth measured during the vehicle inspection showed the right rear tire had zero tread depth; and the left rear tire had a tread depth of just one millimeter (one 32nd of an inch). She is familiar with the roadway and her truck was otherwise in very good working condition except for the two rear tires.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for conditions (specified as: Driver was aware of bald rear tires & did not reduce her speed for the wet roadway while negotiating a curve). Vehicle related, tire degradation was a contributing factor in addition to the wet roadways.
