This case involves an 'L'-type side impact to the left side of a passenger car, behind the B-pillar by the front of a large SUV. The restrained 36-year-old female driver is the case occupant. No side-impact airbag was available. The vehicle, a 2000 four-door Dodge Neon was westbound in the driveway of a parking lot. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe 4x4 was northbound, in the curb-turn lane of a divided four-lane trafficway approaching the intersection of the road and driveway of a parking lot. It was daylight and clear. The case vehicle made a right turn onto the intersecting roadway and crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle. The case vehicle entered a counterclockwise rotation through a channelized intersection, and there was a secondary impact between the two vehicles. The left-front wheel of the case vehicle struck the curb of a raised median as it mouinted it and came to rest in the grass median facing north. V2 came to rest north of the driveway straddling both northbound lanes, facing approximately north-northeast. Both the 36-year-old female driver and the 20-year-old female right-front passenger were restrained by a three-point belt. The four-month-old male center-rear passenger was reportedly in a rear facing child restraint, secured with a lap-bet, without a tether. The driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center, where she was enrolled as a case occupant. The right-front and center-rear passengers sustained police reported possible injuries and were transported to a level-one trauma center and pediatric level-one trauma center respectively.
