This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 51 year old female front right passenger, and restrained 11 year old male rear right passenger of a 2001 Infiniti QX4 4x4 sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1990 Chevrolet C-1500 4x4 pickup truck (Vehicle 2). The case vehicle was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side impact air bags for the front outboard seating positions (right front side impact airbag deployed). Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a right curve. Vehicle 2 was eastbound and negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed Vehicle 2 to cross the centerline into the westbound lane, and across the path of Vehicle 1. Upon recognition of the impending harmful event, the driver of Vehicle 1 steered left in avoidance. At this point, the driver of Vehicle 2 steered right in an attempt to re-enter the eastbound lane. As both vehicles entered the eastbound lane, the front right area of Vehicle 1 was impacted by the front right area of Vehicle 2. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. At impact, Vehicle 1 departed the south pavement edge where it came to rest in a private yard facing southwest. Vehicle 2 departed the north pavement edge where it came to rest in a private yard facing southeast. All four occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center. The driver of Vehicle 1 was treated and released. The remaining three occupants of Vehicle 1 were hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
