The case vehicle, a 1998 Dodge Caravan minivan was westbound on a dry, level, asphalt, two-lane roadway. Vehicle two (V2) a 1998 Chevrolet Tracker SUV was eastbound on the same roadway. It was dark and there was no adverse weather. V2 drifted across the center line and the front-left corner of V2 struck the front-left corner of the case vehicle. The case vehicle entered a counterclockwise rotation and departed the right side of the roadway and came to rest in a shallow ditch facing northeast. V2 also entered a counterclockwise rotation and departed the left side of the roadway and came to rest in a ditch facing south east. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V2 was a fatality. The 42-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained, but the steering-wheel air bag did deploy. He was transported to a local hospital, before he was transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
