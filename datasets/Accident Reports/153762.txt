Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Isuzu Rodeo, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a 4-lane divided freeway (two lanes eastbound, unprotected grassy median, two lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Ford F150, 4-door pickup truck was traveling west in the left westbound lane of the same freeway. It was daylight, cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V2 lost control on the icy surface and entered the grassy median. V2 crossed the median and re-entered the freeway in the left eastbound lane. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid V2 by steering left, but the right-front of V1 struck the right-front of V2 an a narrow-frontal configuration. As V2 was re-entering the road from the median, it is believed that the front of V2 engaged the front of V1 with the bumper of V2 over the bumper of V1(over/underride configuration). The impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise approximately 80 degrees and come to rest in the median facing east-southeast. V2 rotated clockwise approximately 180 degrees and came to rest partially in the right eastbound lane facing east-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The case vehicle (V1) was occupied by a 49-year-old male driver who was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed, he was treated and released a a regional level-one trauma center with minor (MAIS-1, ISS-1) injuries. The 40-year-old female, right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with a serious (MAIS-3) lower extremity injury. The 13-year-old female left-rear passenger of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt, she was treated and released at a regional level-one trauma center with minor (MAIS-1, ISS-1) injuries.
