Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling south in the left southbound lane of rural, four-lane divided freeway (two lanes southbound, unprotected median, two lanes northbound). It was daylight, snowing and the road was slush covered. The driver of V1 was overtaking a slower vehicle in the right lane when he lost control due to the slippery road surface. V1 departed the left side of the road and entered the median. The driver attempted to regain control by steering to the right, but V1 began to rotate in a clockwise manner. V1 tripped over its left wheels/tires and rolled six quarter turns before coming to rest on its roof facing north-northwest. The 50-year-old male driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag did not deploy. The 43-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted airbag did not deploy. The driver refused medical attention but the case occupant was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
