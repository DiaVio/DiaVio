Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Chevrolet Uplander minivan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 Ford Bronco, 2-door utility vehicle was at a stop, facing west, partially on the road, but in the eastbound lane. The driver of V2 had previously been involved in a spin-out and had come to rest at this location. This spinout event had stabilized and it was reported that V2 was stopped at this location for several minutes prior to V1 approaching. It was daylight, snowing with blowing snow, and the bituminous road was snow-covered. As V1 approached V2, the driver of V2 attempted to accelerate back onto the road and return to the westbound lane. As V2 re-entered the road/eastbound lane, the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an angled configuration. Neither driver had any recollection of the crash events but there is no evidence that the driver of V1 was able to brake prior to the impact. Upon impact, V1 pushed V2 backward and back off the road into the ditch, while V1 moved forward and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing east-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 39-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. The 5-year-old male second row left passenger (case occupant) was seated in a no-back booster seat and was using the available three-point seat belt. He was transported to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries. The 15-year-old female third row-center passenger was not using the available three-point seat belt. She sustained serious injuries (MAIS-4, ISS-25) involving the skull, brain and face. She was also transported via ground ambulance to a regiona level-one trauma center.
