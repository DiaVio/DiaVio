This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane, two way blacktop forest road with no paved shoulders. The weather was clear and the road was dry. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Toyota MR2 Spider convertible was westbound and began to negotiate a curve left in the roadway as the right side tires went off the north edge of the roadway. V1 then began to rotate counterclockwise and returned back on to the roadway rotating 180 degrees in lane one before it then departed the roadway to the right with the back end leading now. V1 then continued to rotate counterclockwise another 90 degrees down an embankment off the roadway where the left side of V1 impacted a small tree at the left fender and left A-pillar, and then a second larger tree directly into the driver's door and left B-pillar. A third smaller tree then impacted the left quarter panel as V1 wrapped around the second tree. The driver was the only person in the vehicle and is the case occupant. Some extrication efforts occurred to remove the driver from the vehicle that was disabled and towed. The case driver was a 42 year old female who was unrestrained in this side impact collision. The driver had severe injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center.
