Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Mercury Sable, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a five-lane, two-way road (two lanes eastbound, center turn lane, two lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Chrysler Sebring, 2-door convertible was stopped in the center turn lane, facing west and waiting for traffic to clear before turning left into a private driveway. Vehicle three (V3), an unknown, hit and run, Mercury Cougar, was traveling east in the right eastbound lane and was passing V1 on the right. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the asphalt road surface was dry. As V3 was passing V1, the driver of V3 drifted into the left eastbound lane and the left-side of V3 struck the right-side of V1. This caused the driver of V1 to veer into the center turn lane and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique, offset-frontal configuration. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. V3 fled the scene. The 44-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel and seat-mounted air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
