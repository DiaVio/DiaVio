This case involves an unrestrained 84-year-old female driver of a 2009 Toyota Camry who was involved in a low-speed rollover after a collision with a parked car. The case vehicle, a 2009 four-door Toyota Camry was travelling west on a dry, level, concrete three-lane divided trafficway with a raised median. It was daylight and clear. The case vehicle drifted across the adjacent bike lane and side-swiped a legally parked car, rolled over, left-side leading, one-quarter turn and came to rest in the westbound lane facing west. The driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, and none of the available air bags deployed. She was transported to a level-one trauma center, with moderate injuries, where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
