This two-vehicle crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in an intersection between the main roadway of a parking lot and a connecting driveway. At the location of this crash, the main thoroughfare runs north and south with divisional islands on both sides separating the parking spaces. There are directional arrows and stop line markings painted on the ground indicating which direction vehicles are required to travel. There was a heavy rainstorm, and the roadway was wet at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1995 Toyota Celica with one occupant, was northbound on the lot's primary roadway. V2, a 1996 Ford F-350 with one occupant, was westbound, the wrong way, on a one-way driveway that intersects with the primary roadway. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1, pushing V1 onto a divisional island where it came to final rest. V2 came to final rest at the point of impact. V1 and V2 were both towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 32 kmph for V1 and 32 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a 54-year-old male, suffered minor injuries as a result of the crash. The driver could not be reached for an interview. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded other vehicle encroachment from driveway, across path. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. The only known associated factors that could be coded were the rain and wet roads.

The driver of V2, a 51-year-old male, was uninjured as a result of this crash. He refused to be interviewed and take part in this study. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded an illegal maneuver as V2 was traveling the wrong way down the driveway. Associated factors for V2 include traveling too fast for conditions (reasons unknown), as well as the rain and wet roads.

A witness on-scene stated that he saw V2 rapidly crossing through the parking lot before colliding with V1. He was ignoring all traffic control devices in the parking lot.
