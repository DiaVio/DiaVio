This case involves a frontal impact between the front of a passenger car and the front of a 4x4 pick-up truck. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2009 four-door Hyundai Sonata, was westbound on a wet, divided, level, one-lane (left turn lane) asphalt traffic-way, traveling in a channelized left-turn lane, approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 2012, Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 pick-up truck was eastbound on the same road, in the outside eastbound through lane approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and raining. As the case vehicle was making a left turn, it entered the path of V2. The front-left end of V2 struck the front-right end of the case vehicle. The impact resulted in the case vehicle rotating counterclockwise and V2 rotating clockwise. Consequently, the right side of the case vehicle side-slapped the left side of V2. The case vehicle rode-over a raised median and came to rest in the westbound left-turn lane, facing southeast. V2 departed the roadway at the southeast corner, struck the base of a light standard and struck a utility pole before it came to rest on the roadside facing east-southeast. The case vehicle was occupied by the restrained 175-cm/ 89 kg (5â€™ 9"/ 196 lbs.), 65-year-old male driver. He had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel mounted air bag. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
