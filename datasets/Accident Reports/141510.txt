Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Toyota Camry, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the middle eastbound lane of a six-lane, divided, limited-access freeway (three lanes eastbound, protected median, three lanes westbound). It was daylight, the weather was clear, and bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 was negotiating a left curve in the road when, for an unknown reason, he lost control of the vehicle. V1 veered to the left, crossed the left eastbound lane and left shoulder and the front of V1 struck a tri-beam guardrail/barrier located in the median. V1 reportedly rotated counter clockwise approximately forty (40) degrees and came to rest against the median barrier. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 55-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
