This frontal crash case involves a 67 year old restrained female with deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during the evening hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a two lane (one in each direction) bituminous rural roadway basically curved in origin and without any intersection or traffic control device involvement. The roadway is level and divided by a solid double line. The case vehicle (V1) a 2008 two-door Honda Accord was being driven westbound and vehicle two (V2) a 1994 Ford Ranger (super cab) was being driven eastbound. The crash occurred when V2, after leaving its original travel lane while exiting a right curve, crossed over directly into the path of V1 resulting in a full frontal crash configuration for both vehicles. After initial impact, our case vehicle (V1) was pushed back and to the left while rotating counter clockwise coming to final rest partially in the eastbound lane facing south and V2 rotated slightly clockwise coming to final rest partially in the eastbound lane facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to damage. V1 was driven by the 67 year old female case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt and the retractor type pretensioner did actuate. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact (air bag cut out by rescue). The available seat back and roof side rail mounted air bags did not deploy for this frontal type impact. The case occupant was seriously injuried and transported to a CIREN center by helicopter.
