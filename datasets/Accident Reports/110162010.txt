The focus of this case is on a 75-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2010 Mazda 3 (V1), involved in a frontal impact crash with a building. This single vehicle collision occurred during the early afternoon hours (daylight), of a spring day (Saturday), in a flat bituminous parking lot. The weather was rainy and the parking lot surface was wet. The speed limit for the parking lot is 40 km/h (25 mph). The case occupant was moving V1 from one parking space to another parking space closer to the building. She was not wearing her 3-point lap/shoulder belt but had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag that deployed as a result of the impact. She also had a side thorax air bag and side curtain air bag available, but they did not deploy in this crash. For unknown reasons the case occupant accelerated and departed the eastern edge of the parking lot and continued traveling east for about 50 feet until the front plane of V1 contacted the western wall of a building. After the impact, V1 remained against the wall, pointed in an easterly direction. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by ground, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
