The case occupant is the 175 cm, 65 kg (5 ft 9 in, 142 lb), 63-year-old male driver of a 2005 Jeep Wrangler X, 2-door utility vehicle. The case vehicle swerved to the right to miss a slower moving vehicle, sideswiped a guardrail with the right side, then traveled across the roadway and struck another guardrail with the front end. The initial sideswipe impact was classified as minor and the secondary frontal impact was classified as moderate. The WinSMASH reconstruction program calculated a barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) of 15 kmph (9 mph), which appeared to be consistent with the observed vehicle damage. The case occupant was not using the available three-point seat belt. The steering wheel air bag deployed. The initial steering maneuver and sideswipe appeared to have little effect on the driver's relative seating position. In response to the 1 o'clock direction of force (30 degrees) during the primary impact, the driver moved forward and slightly to his right, relative to the vehicle interior. He sustained several brain and neck injuries probably from head contact with the front header. These include a right frontal lobe contusion, bifrontal subdural hematoma, a right C5 facet fracture, C6 vertebral body fracture, and a right C7 transverse process fracture. These injuries are thought to have occurred from head loading with neck compression and flexion. He sustained multiple fractures of six right ribs (#5-10 and #12), a right posterior grade III liver laceration, a right flank contusion, right L2 transverse process fracture, right iliac fracture, right greater trochanter fracture, and a right inferior pubic ramus fracture probably from contact with the center instrument panel. The driver was found lying in the right-front seating area. He died nine days post-crash.
