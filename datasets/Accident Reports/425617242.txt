This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 27-year-old female belted driver with a deployed frontal airbag. This occupant was driving an intermediate size sedan when she sustained moderate injuries in an angled crash with another intermediate size sedan, resulting in severe damage to the case vehicle. The crash occurred during early afternoon hours on a dry road at an intersection that was part of a highway interchange. A 2013 Hyundai Elantra intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling southwest approaching a three-way intersection intending to proceed straight. The grade was level in V1's direction of travel. A 2012 Nissan Sentra intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) was traveling southeast approaching the same intersection and intending to turn left. The grade was 3% uphill in V2's direction of travel. The intersection was controlled by tri-colored signals. V1 proceeded through the intersection as V2 turned left across V1's intended path. The front plane of V1 struck the left plane of V2 (Event 1). The impact caused both vehicles to rotate into each other such that V2's left tires rubbed across V1's right plane (Event 2). Both vehicles came to rest in the intersection and were towed due to damage. V1 was operated by a 27-year-old female driver. She was wearing her lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by loading to the latch plate and webbing. Both the retractor and anchor pretensioners actuated for this position. No buckle pretensioner was installed. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed in the first event. The available top right instrument panel, seatback, and curtain airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of moderate injuries. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
