This single-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekday afternoon. The crash occurred on a curved segment of a two-lane, two-way, downhill, bituminous, north-south roadway. The speed limit in the area is 72 kmph (45 mph), and there is no reduced advisory speed around the curve. At the time of the crash, it was snowing heavily, and the roadway was slick from ice and snow. The roadway was otherwise free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Volvo XC90 compact SUV, was traveling northbound and negotiating the rightward curvature. V1 lost traction around the curve and rotated slightly clockwise, crossing briefly into the opposing lane. V1 regained partial traction, moved back to its right, and departed the road to the right side, where the front of V1 impacted a tree. V1's right side contacted a second tree and V1 came to rest on the roadside. Police Reported Travel Speed is 48 kmph for V1.

The 32-year-old female driver of V1 reported that she had just left the post office and was heading for a weekly doctor's appointment for ongoing treatment of injuries she sustained in a crash two years ago, wherein her husband was killed. She was wearing her lap and shoulder belt and was a little concerned about the roads, but living up in the mountains she was used to it. She does not work and sleeps seven to ten hours a night, not knowing what time she goes to bed or wakes up. She does not take any drugs or medications. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: This vehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded: Driver-related decision error, too fast for conditions (icy, curved road).
