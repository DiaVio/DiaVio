This case involves a 69 year old female driver of a 2007 Ford Freestar minivan. The driver was the only occupant and was restrained by the 3-point manual safety belt. There was deployment of the frontal airbags and the left head curtain airbag. The crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane rural roadway. The posted speed limit was 56 kph (35 mph) and V1 was reported to be traveling the speed limit. The dry asphalt roadway was straight and level. The right wheels of V1 left the roadway on the south side and traveled approximately 30 meters before re-entering the travel lane. V1 then continued across the center line into the westbound lane before departing the north side of the roadway. V1 traveled through a ditch and impacted an embankment with its frontal plane. V1 rotated counterclockwise and continued traveling parallel with the embankment and rolled two quarter turns to the right for final rest on its top. The driver was suspended upside down by the safety belt for approximately 15 mimutes before help arrived. She was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
