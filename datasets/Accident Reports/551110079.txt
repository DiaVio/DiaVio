This crash occurred at an intersection at night with streetlights. The weather condition was raining and the roadway was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Hyundai Sonata, was eastbound on a two lane, two way street with no traffic controls through the intersection. The posted speed limit for eastbound traffic is 35 mph/56 kmph. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Ford Taurus station wagon was southbound on a two lane, two way street with a stop sign for the intersection with a speed limit of 30 mph/48 kmph for this direction. V2 attempted to turn left when the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1 in the intersection. V1 slid laterally rotating slightly counterclockwise off the roadway into a gravel area on the southeast corner of the intersection where the right rear tire and rim impacted a couple landscape rocks. V2 rotated slightly to the southeast and came to rest in the intersection. The case occupant of the crash is the driver of V1, a 35 year old male who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt with the frontal and the side seatback airbags deploying. The driver was injured and transported to the trauma center. A restrained front right passenger was also an occupant in V1. Both vehicles were disabled and towed from the crash scene.
