Case Summary 2005-11-058

The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a limited access highway on a weekend during the day. The roadway consisted of three lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median with trees and a metal guardrail next to the shoulder. The road was level and curved slightly to the right and had a posted speed limit of 113kmh (70mph). At the time of the crash it was raining hard and the well-traveled bituminous road was wet. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, a 2003 Chevrolet Malibu driven by a 33 year-old female, was traveling at approximately 60-65 mph in lane two. The driver realized that the speed was too fast for the wet conditions and was intending to change lanes to the right, slower lane. V1 began to hydroplane as non-contact vehicles in lane one and lane three passed v1 at the same time. The driver of v1 felt her vehicle lose contact with the pavement and begin to swerve to the left, then to the right as driver steered right, and then back to the left again. V1 left the center lane and rotated counterclockwise across lane three and the left shoulder until the back right of v1 struck the guardrail. The right front of v1 struck the guardrail and the driver then steered left to avoid contact on the right passenger area where her 12 year-old niece was the front right passenger. V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest 75 meters down the road in lane three facing east.

The fully restrained driver and passenger of v1 were transported to a local trauma center. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage.

The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as 'decision error-too fast for conditions'. An Associated Factor was coded for the driver's prescribed hormone medication which has a possible side effect of drowsiness.
