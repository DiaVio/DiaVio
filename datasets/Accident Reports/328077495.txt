This case involves a 63 year old female driver and only occupant of a 2009 Chrysler PT Cruiser. She was restrained by the available 3-point manual seatbelt. The crash occurred at dusk on a dry asphalt two lane roadway at a four leg intersection. The road was level and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The case vehicle (V1) was traveling south approaching the intersection controlled by a flashing yellow light. The other vehicle (V2), a 1998 Geo Prizm four door sedan, was traveling west with a stop sign and red flashing light controlling the westbound traffic. V1 was traveling approximately 89 kph (55 mph) as it approached the intersection. V2's speed as reported by the investigating police officer was approximately128 kph (80 mph). V2 braked and skidded 30 meters prior to impact. V2 struck the case vehicle in the left front door area with the entire front of the vehicle. The case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and came to rest off the road in the southwest quadrant. V2 also rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the eastbound lane of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The case subject was transported by ground to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center due to the seriousness of her injuries. The case vehicle is equipped with seatback mounted side impact airbags that did not deploy in the crash.
