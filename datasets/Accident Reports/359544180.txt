This severe frontal crash involved an 86 year old male driver who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt and had a frontal airbag deployment. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. This crash occurred in the six southbound lanes of a divided freeway under cloudy skies and dry roadway conditions. These lanes are bordered by paved shoulders, and lane one and lane six are designated as car pool lanes. The four vehicles involved in this crash were all travelling in the third southbound lane. Vehicle one (V1), a 2012 Ford Escape compact utility was following vehicle two (V2), a 2013 Ford F150 crew cab pickup truck. Vehicle three (V3), a 2003 BMW 325 sedan was ahead of V2. Finally, vehicle four (V4), a 2007 Volkswagen GTI 3-door hatchback, was following V1. V2 and V3 were decelerating for traffic stopping ahead of them. V1 was not able to decelerate and brake in time and the front of V1 impacted the back of V2. This forced V2 forward and the front of V2 impacted the back of V3. V4 began to brake traveling behind V1, and the front of V4 barely impacted the back of V1. All vehicles came to final rest in lane three facing south. Vehicle one and two were damaged and had to be towed. V3 and V4 were driven from the scene. The case occupant is the driver of V1 who is an 86 year old male. He was wearing the manual lap/shoulder seatbelt and his seat belt pretensioner actuated, plus the steering column mounted frontal airbag deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
