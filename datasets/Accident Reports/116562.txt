Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Chevrolet Suburban, 4-door utiilty vehicle was traveling west in the right westbound thorugh-lane of six-lane, two-way urban roadway and was approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Freightliner, tractor-trailer was traveling north in the right northbound lane of the intersecting eight-lane, divided trafficway (four northbound through-lanes, one northbound right-turn lane, unprotected median, three southbound lanes). Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of the first trailer struck the left side of V1. V1 was redirected to the north and rapidly rotated clockwise. V1 disengaged from V2 and departed the right side of the road and struck a light pole with the front bumper. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. V2 was driven from the scene. The 46-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point, seat-integrated seat belt but no airbags deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
