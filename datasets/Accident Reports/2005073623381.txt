Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 proceeded straight into the intersection. V2, intending to turn left at the intersection began to decelerate, intending to stop and allow V1 to clear the intersection first. V3 came to the intersection and stopped, waiting for the intersection to clear in order to make a left turn. The driver of V2 stated that she was decelerating and felt the need to sneeze, so she pressed down on the brake harder while closing her eyes to sneeze. Unfortunately she pressed on the gas pedal instead of the brake and turned into the path of V1. V1 struck the right side of V2 with its front end. V2 began a clockwise rotation from the impact and struck the front of V3 with its left side. After the impact V1 continued south coming to final rest west of the roadway and south of the intersection. V2 came to final rest at the southwest corner of the roadway, partially off road, facing northeast. V3 remained stationary at the stop sign. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene; V3 was driven from the scene.
