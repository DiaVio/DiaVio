This case involved a restrained 63 year old male driver in a 2011 Toyota Tundra pick-up (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal and side airbags, dual side curtains, and a knee bolster airbag. The frontal steering mounted airbag and driver's frontal knee bolster airbag, driver's outboard seatback mounted airbag, and left side curtain all deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on a dark, dry, asphalt, curved, two-way, two-lane road. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit wasf 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was traveling east in the eastbound lane negotiating a right-hand curve. V1 drifted over the center double yellow lane line and crossed the westbound lane. V1 departed the roadway and crossed a private drive made of gravel. The driver of V1 applied his brakes and skidded across the gravel drive while approaching trees northeast of the intersection. As V1 skidded, it contacted shrubbery with its front. After impact with the shrubbery, V1 contacted a 70 cm diameter tree with its front left. V1 came to rest with the left front fender in contact with the tree and facing east at final rest. V1 was transported from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported from the crash scene to a local hospital by private vehicle; however, he was later transported to a level one trauma center for additional treatment of serious injuries.
