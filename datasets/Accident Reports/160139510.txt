The case occupant is a 21-year-old male, unrestrained driver of a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt coupe, involved in a nearside collision with a tree. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Cobalt coupe, was traveling north in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. While negotiating a curve to the left, V1 departed the roadway to the right with its right tires. This caused the driver of V1 to steer to the left and get back on the roadway. After returning to the roadway, V1 attempted to steer right to straighten out but instead entered a clockwise yaw and then departed the roadway to the left where it struck a large tree with its left side. V1 came to rest off the west side of the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 21-year old male and case study occupant, was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and no airbags deployed in the vehicle. The driver was transported by helicopter to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
