Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 Dodge Dakota, was westbound in lane three. V1 began to "fishtail." V1 rotated (clockwise) off the right side of the road and the front struck the snow bank. V1 then rolled over to the left and came to rest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a twenty-year-old female, was traveling with a twenty-three-year-old female and a twenty-three-year-old male. They were traveling from the driver's sister's house to go bowling. This driver was healthy, well rested and comfortable with her vehicle and passengers. She travels this route daily. This driver stated that she was traveling at 89 kmph (55 mph) and she knew that the roadway was icy. She steered left and right in an attempt to regain control of V1.

The pre-event movement for V1 was coded as "negotiating a curve." The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; traveling too fast for conditions - icy roads." Poor directional control (e.g. failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected) was an associated factor.
