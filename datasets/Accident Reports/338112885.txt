This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 53-year old, female passenger with deployed air bags. She sustained moderate injuries in a frontal crash with an opposing vehicle. The crash occurred late morning in dry, cloudy weather. A 2010 Toyota Sequoia SUV (v1) was traveling north on a rural, bituminous, two-lane roadway. The grade was slightly downhill at 2%. A 1998 Hyundai Elantra sedan (v2) was traveling south on the same roadway. V2 crossed the centerline and impacted v1 head-on (Event 1). Due to V1's much larger size, v2 was pushed back 13 meters from impact coming to rest in the center of the roadway. V1 traveled 5 meters after impact before coming to rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 55-year old male with a 53-year old female, right front passenger who was the case occupant. She was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The top instrument panel, knee bolster, and right curtain airbags deployed as a result of impact. The available right seatback airbag did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance and then later moved to a local trauma center with moderate injuries.
