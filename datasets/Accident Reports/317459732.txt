This case focuses on a restrained 75 year old female driver in a 2007 Nissan Versa (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal, dual first row side airbags, and dual side curtains. The frontal driver's airbag along with the right side outboard seat airbag and right side curtain deployed during the crash. V2, a 2012 Ford Explorer was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during dusk on a dry, bituminous, level, six-lane traffic way. The eastbound lanes (four lanes) and westbound lanes (three lanes) were separated by non-positive grassy and concrete medians respectively. The crash occurred at a controlled four-legged intersection. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph) for all directions of traffic. V1 was traveling in the left turn lane of the eastbound lanes attempting to make a left turn to head northbound at the intersection. V2 was traveling in the far right lane of the westbound lanes and attempting to crossover the intersection. As the two vehicles entered the intersection, the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. After impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise. V2 rotated clockwise after impact. The rotation of both vehicles caused the right rear of V1 to contact the left side of V2. V2 continued northwest while still in contact with V1 causing V1 to continue its rotation before coming to rest. Both vehicles came to rest near the intersection. V1 faced northwest at final rest. V2 faced north at final rest. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a local trauma center and treated for serious injuries she sustained during the crash.
