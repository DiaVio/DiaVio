This case involves a thirty year old male driver 169 centimeters tall and weighing 78 kilograms. The case occupant was the unbelted driver of a 2005 Pontiac Sunfire involved in a frontal collision. The frontal airbag deployed. The brain stem transection and atlanto-occipital dislocation were attributed to the head contacting the instrument panel over the steering wheel with a possible confidence level. The aorta transection and the mulitple right and left sided rib fractures along with the T8 dislocation were attributed to the chest contacting the steering wheel through the airbag with a probable confidence level. The bilateral hemothoraces were attributed to the aorta transection. The liver and spleen lacerations were attributed to the abdomen contacting the steering wheel through the airbag with a probable confidence level. The central pubic symphysis fracture was attributed to the right and left knee contacting the knee bolster with a possible confidence level. The open tibia and fibula fractures were attributed to the foot contacting the toe pan with a certain confidence level. The scrotal laceration was of unknown origin. The toe lacerations and metatarsal fractures were attributed to the toe pan. The lip laceration was attributed to the instrument panel.
