The case occupant is a 51 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, involved in a head-on frontal collision with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during evening hours with clear, dry conditions on a three lane, two way roadway. In the area where the crash occurred, the one eastbound travel lane has a downhill grade, the two westbound lanes have an uphill grade, and there are curbs present on both sides of the roadway. The east and westbound lanes are separated by a painted median and on the north side of the street there is a narrow grass strip adjacent to the roadway, followed by a sidewalk. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Pontiac Solstice two door convertible, was traveling east in the eastbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2011 Toyota Highlander compact utility vehicle, was traveling west in the inside westbound lane. There was a non-contact vehicle traveling ahead of V1. V1 moved left into the center painted median area in order to pass the non-contact vehicle. V1 crossed over the painted median and traveled into V2's lane of travel. The front of V1 struck V2 head-on, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of its driver side frontal air bag. From the point of impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest facing north straddling the painted median and the eastbound lane. V2 moved rearward from the point of impact. V2 traveled up and over the north curb and came to final rest off the roadway, facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 51 year old male driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt with a steering column mounted frontal air bag deployment. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
