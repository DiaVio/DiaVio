This case involves a single right-side leading vehicle rollover. The restrained 23-year-old male driver is the case occupant. The available frontal-impact air bag did not deploy. The case vehicle, a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV, was southbound on a dry, two-lane asphalt road with a 2% down grade negotiating a left-sweeping curve approaching a three-legged intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. The case vehicle drifted off the west edge of the roadway and the driver attempted to steer back into the southbound lane. The case vehicle entered a counterclockwise yaw, crossed the center line, departed the roadway off the shoulder and began a right-side leading rollover on the roadside. The vehicle rolled at least eight quarter-turns across the roadside onto the intersecting roadway, crossed both travel lanes, departed the intersecting roadway and came to rest on its wheels, facing north on the south side of the road. The 23-year-old male driver was wearing a belt restraint, but the available frontal-impact air bag did not deploy. He was the only occupant of the case vehicle. The driver sustained severe injuries. He was transported to an outside facility and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
