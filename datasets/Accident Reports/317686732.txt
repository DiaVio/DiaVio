This case focuses on a restrained 26 year old female front right passenger in a 2007 Ford Fusion (V1). There was also an unrestrained 18 year old female driver in V1. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual side airbags. The steering wheel mounted airbag, passenger frontal airbag, right side outboard seatback mounted airbag, and right side curtain all deployed during the crash. V2, a 2006 Chevrolet HHR was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred on a straight and dry, two-way, two-lane roadway whose lanes ran north to south. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). The southbound lane had a slight downhill grade and the northbound lane was level. V1 was traveling south in the southbound lane when its right tires drifted off the roadway onto the right roadside. This lane departure caused the driver of V1 to steer left in an attempt to move V1 back into its travel lane. The driver overcorrected causing her to lose control of V1. V1 went left and crossed over its original travel lane while its driver applied her brakes. V1 then skidded and entered the opposing lane of traffic while in a counterclockwise yaw. The driver of V2 noticed V1 entering his lane and began to apply his brake in an attempt to avoid contact with V1. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise after impact and continued off the roadside adjacent to the northbound lane. V1 faced southwest at final rest. V2 was pushed rearward after impact and came to rest after rotating clockwise in its original travel lane facing southwest. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The front right passenger in V1 sustained severe injuries in the crash and was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance. However, she was later transported to a level one trauma center where she received additional treatment.
