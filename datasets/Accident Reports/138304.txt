Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford Ranger, extended cab pickup was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. It was dark, the weather was sleet/snow/hail and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V1 lost control on the icy road and V1 began to rotate in a clockwise manner. V1 departed the right side of the road while rotating to the right, crossed a private driveway, and struck a double-trunked tree with the left side door of V1. V1 came to rest against the tree and was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 66-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with critical injuries.
