This case involved a belted front right seat, male, passenger of a mid-sized passenger car responding to a 'moderate' frontal impact with the back of another similar vehicle. The subject's frontal impact air bag deployed. This two-vehicle crash occurred on the eastbound side of a four-lane, divided interstate traveling through a rural area. The two eastbound lanes were divided from the westbound lanes by a natural median, were level and curved gently right. The weather was clear and the concrete lanes dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2002 Toyota Camry, 4-door sedan) was traveling eastbound in the number-two (left) lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. There were two occupants in V1. The 75-year-old female driver and the 76-year-old male front right seat passenger (case subject) were both using the belt restraints. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2001 Volkswagen Passat, 4-door sedan) was also traveling eastbound in the number-two lane further ahead of V1. V2 was slowing in the number-two lane at an approximated/estimated lower speed. The driver of V1 did not realize that V2, to her front, had been gradually slowing and was now close in front of her. The driver braked, but struck the back plane of V2 with its front. V1's frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact brought V1 to a stop within close proximity of the point of impact, facing northeast in the number-two lane. V2 came to rest facing east in the number-two lane as well. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The occupants of V1 (subject, front right seat passenger) were both transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury for the case subject. The driver of V2 was not injured.
