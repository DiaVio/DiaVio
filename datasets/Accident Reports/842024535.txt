This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 71 year old male driver of a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado LT C-1500 Crew Cab 4x2 pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal airbag deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree (event 4). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two-lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline and subsequently departed the left (east) pavement edge in a forward tracking mode. Vehicle 1 continued in a southerly direction alongside (parallel) to the roadway. The left side wheels entered a shallow ditch (undercarriage possibly "bottomed out") as the front left area struck a patch of brush (event 1), barbed-wire fence (event 2), and small diameter tree (event 3). These events were minor in nature, and did not alter the vehicle's trajectory as it entered a wooded area. The front left area impacted an adjacent large diameter tree (event 4) resulting in moderate damage. Engagement with the struck tree continued down the left side surface into the front door area, which resulted in severe damage. Maximum engagement with the struck tree occurred (longitudinally) between the left front wheel and A-pillar. This produced a sufficient longitudinal deceleration to deploy the vehicle's driver frontal air bag; late in the crash sequence. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise as the frontal area impacted two additional small diameter trees (events 5 & 6) resulting in overlapping minor damage. Vehicle 1 came to rest straddling the east pavement edge of the roadway facing southeast. The restrained 71 year old male driver of the 2006 Chevrolet Silverado pickup was presumed to be seated in an upright posture, with the seat track adjusted to a full rearward position. Restraint use was evidenced by the loading marks documented on the driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. The first three impacts were minor in nature and probably produced little if no kinematic response from the driver. At impact 4, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the manual restraint, knee bolster, and deployed driver frontal air bag. Scuff marks were identified on the left knee bolster cover panel, with deformation noted to the aft reinforcement frame. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal air bag was evidenced by the scuff mark documented on the face of the membrane. At this point, the driver loaded through the deployed frontal air bag and deformed the upper portion of the steering wheel rim. Associated column compression, and (vertical/lateral) column movment were also noted. During post-impact counterclockwise spinout to final rest, the driver kinematic was re-directed to the right. The right pelvic/extremity regions loaded the center fold-down armrest, which was found deformed to the right. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
