Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a belted, 45-year-old female right front passenger of a 2007 Pontiac Torrent utility vehicle, which was involved in a frontal impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the evening hours (dark, no street lights) of a fall weekday, on a bituminous two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally east and west and has a downhill grand and a left turning curve for the westbound travel direction. The speed limit for the roadway is 40 mph (64 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2007 Pontiac Torrent utility vehicle, was being operated by a 42-year-old male driver in the westbound travel lane, approaching the crash area from the east. Occupying the right front seating position was the 45-year-old female passenger (case occupant). Both the driver and right front passenger were restrained by their respective 3-point, lap/shoulder belts and Vehicle 1 is noted to be equipped with frontal air bags only. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the downhill left turning curve and continue traveling westbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway and subsequently struck a large tree with its front right plane (event 1). Vehicle 1 pivoted/rotated clockwise about the tree and came to rest at the impact area facing a northwesterly direction. As a result of the impact, Vehicle 1's frontal impact air bags deployed and the driver's and right front passenger's retractor type pretensioners actuated. Post-Crash: The driver and the right front passenger (case occupant) of Vehicle 1 were transported, by air unit, to a regional trauma center. The driver of Vehicle 1 was treated and released, but the right front passenger of Vehicle 1 was hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
