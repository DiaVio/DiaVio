This crash occurred during daylight hours on three lane, two way highway. The weather was clear with dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Ford Escape compact utility was traveling in the single eastbound lane and the roadway curved to the right and had a downgrade. Through the curve V1 continued straight and crossed over the two westbound lanes before departing the roadway to the right. V1 dropped down an embankment and first struck the front of V1 into tree log that it then ran over. V1 continued further and then the front left corner impacted a large tree. V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest near the tree. Only minor damage occurred to the engine hood even with significant crush at the bumper corner to this tree that should have also crushed the hood. It appears the hood may have flipped up during the impact or when it ran over the tree log prior to impact with the tree. The vehicle was damage and towed. The case occupant is the front right passenger who was 49 year old female and was not wearing the lap/shoulder belt with the front instrument mounted air bag deploying. This occupant had serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The male driver was restrained with the lap and shoulder belted and the front steering column air bag deployed. This driver reportedly had minor injuries and transported to a hospital.
