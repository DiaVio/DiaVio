This is a single vehicle ran off the left side of the roadway type crash that occurred in the evening during dark hours, on a two way; six lane dry asphalt roadway. The roadway has three westbound and three eastbound lanes that are separated by a raised median. The median contains large rocks on several random locations in the median. The speed limit on the roadway is posted 56 kmph (35 mph). The roadway is dark with ambient lightning in the area from businesses in the area. There were no adverse weather conditions and the weather was clear. There were no sight line restrictions and no obstructions noted.

Vehicle one (V1), 2000 Pontiac 2 door Grand Prix coupe driven by a 33 year-old male, was traveling eastbound in the number three lane when the vehicle departed the left side of the roadway. V1 then traveled onto the raised median when the left front of the vehicle struck a large rock. The vehicle continued to strike several other rocks in the median until it traveled into the number three westbound where it came to rest facing east in the westbound number three lane. A breath test was administered by police within an hour of the crash, which registered a .000%. The driver was later to be found under the influence of a controlled substance. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1.

The critical pre crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: sleeping, that is actually asleep. The driver told police that he had probably fallen asleep. The driver also could not recall the events that led up to the crash, plus he was under the influence of a controlled substance. The shallow angle of road departure to the left supports the coding of a driver who had fallen asleep.
