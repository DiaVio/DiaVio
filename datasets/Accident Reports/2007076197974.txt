This single vehicle crash occurred in a rural area on a two-lane asphalt roadway. The road is straight and downhill for eastbound traffic. The posted speed limit is 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred mid-afternoon during daylight with no adverse weather or road conditions present.

Vehicle one (V1) was a 2003 Jeep Liberty driven by a forty (40) year old male with one passenger. V1 was eastbound and had just successfully passed a non-contact vehicle. V1 then attempted to pass another non-contact vehicle just as that vehicle began to slow to turn left. V1 returned to the eastbound lane where it over-steered left and departed the westbound road edge as it rotated counter-clockwise. V1 impacted a bush and then with its rear right side plane, contacted a large boulder. V1 then rolled right 3-quarter rolls during which it contacted another bush and another large boulder. V1 came to rest on its left side on the westbound roadside facing west and was towed due to damage. The driver was unable to be contacted. Police Reported Travel Speed is 113 kmph for V1.

Two witnesses stated V1 had passed the first vehicle, returned to the eastbound lane and attempted to pass the second vehicle before swerving back into the eastbound lane as the second vehicle slowed to turn left. Both witnesses stated the driver of V1 over-steered left and lost control. The PAR indicates the driver had been consuming alcohol as well.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: overcompensation. Inadequate surveillance, speed too fast, aggressive driving and poor directional control were associative factors.
