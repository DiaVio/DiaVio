Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Chrysler 300M, was exiting southbound on the one way, two lane entrance lane and then crossed a two lane, two way driveway and departed the roadway on to a grassy area. V1 then crossed a side walk and travelled on to and across the main four lane, two way roadway into the business. V1 continued southeast and departed this roadway across a curbed landscape before the front of V1 impacted the right side of a parked car facing west. The parked car and V1 rotated and side slapped the right sides together. This parked car moved laterally and impacted another adjacent parked car that was forced into a third adjacent parked car. V1 then began to roll to the left side and on to its roof sliding on the pavement across the parking lot. While on its roof, V1 impacted the right side into a yellow curb before the right side also impacted a tree. V1 came to final rest on its roof against this tree that tilted and slightly uprooted. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who is a 56 year old female wearing the lap/shoulder belt. The frontal airbag deployed on the frontal impact to the parked car.
