This single vehicle-crash occurred on a weekend during early afternoon hours. The location was a three lane divided (without a positive barrier) straight asphalt roadway. The posted speed limit for the west-east roadway was 56 kph (35 mph). A 20 mph school zone sign was present but not in effect.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Ford Focus with one occupant, was traveling west in the first lane of the westbound roadway. V1 drove off the road to the right, and impacted a utility pole with its front. The pole broke into two pieces. The upper piece was still connected to a utility wire. It struck the top of V1, causing damage to the roof. V1 continued to drive west. The driver tried to reenter the roadway and impacted an aluminum pole with its front right. The aluminum pole then struck the top of the trunk and the right side. V1 reentered lane one and continued to move west before it came to a final rest in an alley located north of the westbound traffic lanes. V1 was towed from the scene. The driver was not injured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

A 21-year old male was the driver of the vehicle. The driver is in good health and does not take any medication. He was well rested and drove a mile (1.6 Kilometers) to the crash site. The driver does not possess a valid driver's license. He said some change fell out of his pocket (he was wearing a jogging suit type jacket, the change was in his right side pocket) and fell behind the driver's seat. He reached behind the driver's seat to retrieve the coins with his right hand. He kept his left hand on the steering wheel. The movement of his upper body caused a movement of his left hand to the right. This caused him to drive off the roadway.

The critical per-crash event was coded "this vehicle traveling-off the edge of the road on the right side." The critical reason was coded "driver related factor - internal distraction."
