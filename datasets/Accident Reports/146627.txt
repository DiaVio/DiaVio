Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2006 Ford Mustang, 2-door coupe was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 drifted off the right side of the road and steered left to re-enter the road. V1 came across the southbound lane and crossed into the northbound lane. The driver then steered right but V1 began a clockwise yaw and crossed the centerline, southbound lane, and departed the right-side of the road. V1 tripped over its left side wheels and began to roll about its longitudinal axis. V1 was entering its second quarter turn (vehicle inverted) when it struck a large tree with the right door, sill and roof siderail. This impact, which caused the tree to fall over as well as causing V1 to begin rotating about its Z-axis, occurred approximately 3 meters above the ground surface. V1 then struck a second group of trees with the right-rear quarter panel. V1 fell to the ground on the far side of this second tree group and came to rest on its right side facing north. V1 was towed from the scene due to diasabling vehicle damage. The 40-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel and seatback mounted air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and treated for minor (AIS-1) injuries. The 37-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash and seatback mounted air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
