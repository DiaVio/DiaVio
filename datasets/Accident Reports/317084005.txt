This case involved a 20 year old male driver of a 2008 Dodge Avenger four door sedan (V1). There was deployment of the steering wheel and right instrument mounted frontal airbags. The left seatback mounted thorax airbag and left roof side rail head curtain airbag also both deployed. The driver was not wearing the available 3-point lap and shoulder seatbelt. The crash involved a single vehicle impact with two trees. It occurred on a rural roadway during daylight hours on a dry asphalt roadway. There were no adverse weather conditions. The roadway was level and curved to the right. V1 was traveling south as it entered a right curve. V1 drifted over the center lane line then departed the left side of the roadway. V1 traveled along the roadside while in a slight clockwise yaw for approximately 48 meters before striking a 29cm diameter tree with its left front fender. The tree was uprooted and V1 continued for another 2 Â½ meters then impacted a 38cm diameter tree with the same left fender. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 30 degrees and came to rest next to the second tree. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was airlifted to an area hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center due to serious injuries sustained in the crash.
