This single-vehicle collision occurred during daylight hours on a weekend afternoon. The crash occurred at the T-intersection of a north-south roadway and an east-west roadway; the east-west roadway intersects the east curb of the north-south roadway. Both roadways are two-lane, two-way, straight, level, bituminous roads; the speed limit is 56 kmph (35 mph) in all directions. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse weather conditions, and the roadway was free of defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1990 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, was traveling northbound in the first lane, approaching the T-intersection on its right with the intention of turning right. V1 lost traction as it approached the turn and began to rotate clockwise as it traversed the intersection. V1 departed the road over the northeast corner, impacting the raised curb with its left wheels. The impacted caused V1 to roll over on to its left side (one quarter-turn), where V1 came to rest. The driver and two passengers of V1 exited the vehicle and departed the scene, unidentified. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

Nothing is known about the driver of V1. The physical evidence at the scene indicates that V1 was traveling above the posted speed limit. V1 was unable to maintain traction during the turning maneuver due to its speed. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1, and was coded: Driver-related decision error, too fast for curve/turn.
