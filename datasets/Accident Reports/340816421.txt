This case involves a side-impact between the left fender of a passenger car and the front of a transit bus. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2011 four-door, Kia Optima was northbound on a one-way, dry, level, two-lane, concrete roadway approaching a four-leg intersection controlled by stop-signs. The roadway surface leading up to the intersection transitions to asphalt. Vehicle two (V2) a 2011, transit bus was in the outside eastbound lane of the intersecting four-lane road, approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and clear. As the case vehicle was crossing through the intersection it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left fender of the case vehicle. The impact resulted in the case vehicle rotating clockwise, riding over the south curb east of the intersection before it came to rest, facing south, straddling the roadway and the roadside. V2 came to a controlled stop in the inside eastbound lane east of the intersection facing east. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the restrained 48-year-old female driver. She had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact, seat-back and roof side-rail mounted side-impact air bags. The driver sustained multiple moderate injuries and was transported to a level one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
