This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 20-year old, female driver with deployed air bags and a belted, 19-year old, female passenger with deployed airbags. The driver and passenger both sustained serious injuries in a frontal crash with a concrete culvert drainage pipe. The crash occurred in the early morning hours in dry, clear weather. A 2005 Toyota Scion tC 3-door hatchback (v1) was negotiating a left curve on a rural, bituminous, two-lane roadway heading south. There was a 4% downhill grade and the roadway was not lighted. As v1 negotiated the left curve, it traveled partially off the roadway to the right. V1 then re-entered the roadway, crossed both travel lanes and departed the left side. V1 impacted a mailbox post with its front plane followed by a concrete culvert in a ditch. V1 subsequently rotated counter clockwise 140 degrees, coming to rest on a gravel driveway off the east roadside. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 20-year old female case occupant and occupied by a 19-year old right front passenger case occupant. Both occupants were restrained by lap and shoulder belts with actuated retractor pretensioners. The steering wheel, driver's knee bolster, and passenger front instrument panel airbags deployed as a result of impact. The available seat back and curtain airbags did not deploy. Both occupants were transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance where they were diagnosed with serious injuries before being transferred to a local trauma center.
