This one-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon on a rural, three-lane, dry, straight, level roadway approaching an offset, four-way intersection. The road runs north and south at the location of the crash and has one through lane and one right turn lane for southbound traffic. The road has a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). At the time of the crash it was clear; there were no adverse weather conditions, sight restrictions or road defects.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 GMC Sierra regular cab pickup was southbound in the through lane. V1 departed the right side of the road onto a curbed roadside, traveled on the roadside for a few meters, re-entered and crossed the roadway then departed the left side of the road, rotated clockwise and impacted a fence with its left side, tripped over and rolled left a total of five quarter turns, impacting the fence with its right side while inverted, and came to rest on its driver side in a private yard facing generally northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.

The V1 driver, a restrained 16-year-old male was taken to a local hospital later with a large cut on his left arm. The right front seat passenger, a 17-year-old male, was not injured. The V1 driver is 16 years old and has driven for three only months. Fatigue was a factor: the V1 driver stated that he put his head against the window; his father was out of town and the V1 driver hosted a party the night before; he got to bed at 2330 hours the previous evening and woke up at 1000 hours. The driver just went to have breakfast at a restaurant and was coming home to clean the garage out for his father. The driver takes the medication Zyrtec; drowsiness and fatigue are possible side effects of this medication. The driver stated he swerved to the right when a vehicle pulled out into the intersection in front of him; however, the control loss began far before the driver arrived at the intersection. The slight angle of initial road departure is indicative of a person who has fallen asleep. It is surmised that when the vehicle departed the right side of the road and went over a curb, that this awakened the driver and he tried to direct the vehicle back onto the roadway. After he directed the vehicle back onto the roadway he was going at too high a rate of speed and when he steered right he over corrected and the vehicle went into a yaw and departed the left side of the roadway and eventually rolled over.

The V1 critical pre-crash event was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to this driver as a driver related critical non-performance error: sleeping, that is, actually asleep. V1 drifted off the right side of the road, returned to the roadway and then drifted across the road and departed the left side of the road prior to the 1st event.
