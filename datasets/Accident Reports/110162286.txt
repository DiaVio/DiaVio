The focus of this case is on a 59 year old female driver (case occupant) of a 2005 Kia Rio (V1) involved in a near side impact with a 2000 Toyota Corolla (V2) followed by a frontal impact by V1 into a concrete traffic barrier. This two vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours (daylight), of a spr on a straight flat five lane East/West bituminous road. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. The speed limit for the road is 89 km/h (55 mph). For an unknown reason, V1 departed the 4th eastbound travel lane to the right into the center eastbound travel lane. V1 then departed the center eastbound travel lane to the right into the 2nd eastbound travel lane. Finally V1 departed the 2nd eastbound travel lane to the right into the far right eastbound travel lane where the right side of V1 sideswiped the left side of V2. V1 then spun clockwise across the two adjacent exit ramp lanes where the front of V1 contacted the concrete traffic barrier adjacent to the far right exit ramp lane. V1 rebounded off of the concrete traffic barrier and continued a clockwise yaw impacting the left side with the concrete traffic barrier until coming to rest pointed in a northwesterly direction in the 2nd lane of the exit ramp. The case occupant was removed from the vehicle by rescue personnel and transported to the trauma center by ground. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash. The driver of V2 was uninjured and V2 was not towed from the scene.
