Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 41-year-old, female driver, of a 2010 Ford Fusion 4-door sedan, which was involved in a frontal impact with a utility pole. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the late evening hours (dark, street light present), of a fall weekend, on a curved and graded, two-lane roadway. This residential roadway runs generally north and south and has an uphill grade and a right turning curve for the northbound travel direction. The roadway has a speed limit of 25 mph (40 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2010 Ford Fusion 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 41-year-old female driver (case occupant), in the northbound travel lane. She was not restrained by an available 3-point lap/shoulder belt, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat back mounted side air bags (front outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the graded right turning curve and continue traveling north. Crash: As Vehicle 1 traveled north, it departed the northbound travel lane, crossed over the southbound travel lane and departed the west edge of the roadway. At this time, Vehicle 1 impacted a wooden utility pole (not damaged) with its frontal plane. Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise less than 90 degrees and came to rest at or near the struck pole, facing a westerly direction. As a result of the pole impact, the driver's frontal air bag deployed for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
