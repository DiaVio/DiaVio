This frontal crash case involves a 17-year-old restrained male with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred at night under wet, rainy conditions. The crash occurred on a two lane, two-way roadway on a curve. The roadway is level and is seperated by a solid double line. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2006 Toyota Prius 5-door being driven southbound and vehicle two (V2) is a 2002 Ford Escape utility vehicle being driven northbound. The crash occurred when V2, for unknown reasons, crossed the centerline of the roadway, resulting in a full frontal crash configuration for both vehicles. V1 came to final rest on the west shoulder of the roadway; V2 came to rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by the 17-year-old case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
