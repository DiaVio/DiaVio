This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 26 year old female front right passenger of a 2006 Honda Accord LX 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags (for the driver and front right passenger positions), front seat-mounted side impact airbags (torso protection), and side curtain airbags (for the outboard seating positions). The frontal airbag system, right side impact airbag, and right side curtain airbag deployed as a result of an oblique angle collision with a 1998 Dodge 1500 Club Cab 4x4 pickup truck (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a multi-lane urban roadway and attempting to turn left (west) into a narrow business driveway. Vehicle 2 was southbound on the same urban roadway and proceeding straight. It should be noted that a northbound (non-contact) vehicle, stopped ahead of Vehicle 1, was reportedly blocking the view off both involved drivers. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. As Vehicle 1 crossed the southbound lanes, the right side surface was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage (event 1). Upon recognition of the impending harmful event, the driver of Vehicle 1 reported to police that he accelerated in an attempt to avoid the collision. This initial impact deployed Vehicle 1's frontal airbag system, right (seat mounted) side impact airbag, and right curtain airbag. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and began its post-impact trajectory into the south sector. Vehicle 1's left rear wheel subsequently struck the right (west) curb, which deployed the left side impact airbag and curtain airbag (event 2). Vehicle 1 continued in a southerly direction where the back right area impacted a fire hydrant resulting in minor damage (event 3). The fire hydrant fractured and separated from its base. Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise off the hydrant, traversed an adjacent sidewalk, and came to rest in a grassy area off the west pavement edge facing northwest. Vehicle 2 also departed the right (west) pavement edge and struck a building where it came to rest facing southwest. The unrestrained 26 year old female front right passenger of the 2006 Honda Accord was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat track adjusted to a mid-to-rearward position. The lack of restraint usage was confirmed by the lap and shoulder webbing found restricted in the retracted (stowed) position by extensive lateral intrusions. At impact with Vehicle 2, the front right passenger initiated a lateral and slightly forward trajectory in response to the 2 o'clock impact force and loaded the deployed right side impact airbag, right side curtain airbag, and right front interior surface. Interaction with the deployed side airbags were evidenced by the scuff and smudge marks identified on the inboard face of each membrane. Loading of the right side interior surface (door panel/lower B-pillar) was evidenced by the scuff marks and indentations documented on these components. Contact evidence noted on the left aspect of the front right seatback was indicative of (unrestrained) driver penetration into the passenger space during the initial impact occupant kinematic, resulting in further compression of the passenger into the right side interior surface. Following the crash, both occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported to the emergency room of a local hospital. The front right passenger was admitted for treatment of serious injuries as the driver was treated for (police reported) minor injuries and released. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
