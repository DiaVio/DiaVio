This is a single vehicle rollover crash that occurred in the morning hours during darkness on a dirt/gravel, rural roadway with no lighting and no traffic controls. The roadway is level and straight and bounded on the north side by an elevated, four-foot dirt embankment that is flat on top. This vehicle was traveling eastbound with the headlights on. The statutory speed limit is 80 kmph (50 mph), although the speed limit is not posted here. The location was flat and level with no roadway deficiencies. There were no adverse weather conditions.

Vehicle one (V1) is a Blue 1992 Buick Park Avenue 4 door sedan. It was traveling eastbound in lane one with a police reported speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). Tire/yaw marks on the dirt/gravel road surface shows the vehicle initiated a counterclockwise yaw in eastbound lane one before it left the north edge of the road and entered the four-foot dirt embankment. The driver then steered hard right, the vehicle initiated a clockwise rotation before the left side tires dug into the soft dirt and the vehicle rolled over 4 quarter turns before coming to rest on its wheels facing generally southwest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

Tire/yaw marks in the dirt/gravel road surface identify the path of the vehicle as it initiated the counterclockwise yaw before it left the roadway. The driver claimed there was an oncoming vehicle with its lights off and he swerved hard right to avoid the oncoming vehicle. There was no physical evidence on the road surface of any type of avoidance maneuver and the scenario of an oncoming vehicle was discounted. The driver was on his way to work and was in a hurry because he was late.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected).
