The crash occurred on a north/south four-lane median divided urban highway. There were two lanes and a right paved shoulder in each direction divided by a grass median. A guardrail was present off the west side of the road. Recent traffic counts indicate the highway carries 42,935 vehicles per day in the crash area. The road curved to the west (right) as it traveled southward with a radius of curvature of 348 meters. Near initial roadway departure the highway was level with a super elevation (right) of 4%. As the highway continued south it began a downhill grade of 4% with a super elevation of 10%. The posted speed limit was 80kmph (50mph). Conditions were dark with streetlights present sometime on an early weekday morning.

Vehicle #1 was a 2001 Ford Explorer traveling south in the left (2nd) lane. As the driver negotiated the curve right the SUV edged off the left (east) side of the road. The driver overcorrected and the vehicle began a clockwise yaw as it returned to the road 54 meters south of initial departure. Vehicle #1 rotated approximately 110 degrees before departing the right (west) side of the road and striking the end of a guardrail with its left side. Although the guardrail extended down nearly the entire west (right) side of the road, there was a small gap in the guardrail of approximately 2 meters and the vehicle struck the south end of the guardrail in the gap. The Explorer then climbed over the guardrail and rolled left two quarter turns down a 45% tree and brush covered embankment, striking a large tree with its right as it rolled. It came to rest facing northwest on its top 20 meters southwest of initial impact. The SUV was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 20-year old male that was not belted with no deployed airbags. He was partially ejected in the crash and dead at the scene. The time of the crash is unknown; a passer by noticed the vehicle down the embankment during morning rush hour. Although blood alcohol results were not available prior to case release from the PSU the driver was videoed at a local nightclub obviously intoxicated and vomiting in the early morning hours before the crash.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was overcompensation.
