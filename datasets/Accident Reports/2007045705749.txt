The crash occurred in a residential area at a T-type intersection between two residential roads. One ran north/south and the other intersected on the west side. There was also a private drive northeast of the intersection. The north leg of the intersection had two lanes, (one each way). They were divided by two double yellow lines that spread to create a third (center/left turn only lane) lane on the south side of the intersection. The north/south road was straight with a negative (if southbound) grade of 3.7% at the precrash approach and a negative 4.1% grade in the impact/path to final rest area. Conditions at the time of the crash were daylight and dry with cloud cover in the early afternoon on a weekend. The posted speed limit was 56kph/35mph.

V1 was a 1997 Chevrolet Blazer 4x4 that had pulled from the private drive into the area between the double yellow lines on the north leg of the intersection where it stopped in preparation for a right/west turn onto the road intersecting from the west. V1 then attempted a right turn and was sideswiped on the right side by the left side of V2, a 2001 Ford Taurus that was traveling south in lane one of the north/south roadway. Both vehicles came to rest facing south at the southwest corner of the intersection approximately 12-15 meters south of impact. V1 was driven away and V2 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

V1 was driven by a belted twenty-four-year-old female who was pregnant (28weeks) and transported to a local hospital with possible injuries. She is admittedly emotionally unstable with a medical/mental history (in and out of psychiatric hospitals) and was departing an ex-boyfriends house where they had just argued. She was on her way home at the time of the crash. She did claim to be paying attention to a non-contact vehicle that was facing her in the center lane on the south side of the intersection as he was waiting to turn into the same road that was her intended destination.

The critical precrash event for V1 was this vehicle traveling over the right side of the travel lane. The critical reason was inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see. The driver was coded as fatigued due to combination of pregnancy, lack of recent sleep, and constant arguing with ex-boyfriend over several days previous to crash. She was taking several medications including an anti-psychotic drug. The non-contact vehicle was coded as an exterior factor. She was also coded as being inattentive due to preoccupation with her personal issues. Illegal maneuver was also coded, as the “lane” she was making her turn from was not a lane at all. She also turned with an obstructed view because she claimed not to be able to see well looking back to her right due to tinted windows with B and C pillars blocking her view. She was upset and not very comfortable with the size of her vehicle (too big).

V2 was driven by a sixty-three-year-old belted female who was uninjured in the crash along with her two passengers. She did not expect V1 to turn as soon as she (V2) was along side of her according to her statement. She was unable to be contacted for a follow-up to her on scene statement.

The critical precrash event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. False assumption, assumed that the other vehicle would yield the right of way was coded here. No other contributing factors were coded to this vehicle.
