The case occupant is a 27 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a head-on frontal collision with a school bus. His frontal air bag deployed and he sustained severe injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way roadway, during daylight hours, under clear weather and wet roadway conditions. In the crash area, the eastbound travel lane is level and curves to the left, and the westbound lane is level and curves to the right. There are no shoulders or curbs present on either side of the roadway. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Chrysler 300 four door sedan, was traveling east in the eastbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2004 Blue Bird school bus, was traveling west in the westbound lane. As both vehicles were negotiating the curved section of roadway, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and crossed over into V2's lane of travel. V1's front left struck V2's front left, resulting in the actuation of V1's front row seat belt retractor pretensioners and the deployment of its frontal air bags. V1 under rode V2, then rotated counterclockwise as it continued east. V1 came to final rest on the south edge of the eastbound lane, facing northeast. V2 was driven to a controlled stop. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 27 year old male driver who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and his steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center, where he was hospitalized for thirty-nine days. There were no other occupants in V1. There were many passengers riding in V2. Per the investigating officer, V2's driver and several passengers sustained minor injuries. The driver and one occupant of V2 were taken to an area hospital but their treatment status is not known.
