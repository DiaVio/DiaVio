Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Buick LeSabre, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Ford Mustang, 2-door coupe was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. Both vehicles were traveling up a positive grade, approaching a hillcrest. It was dark, snowing, and the bituminous road surface was icy. As V2 reached the hillcrest, the driver lost control on the icy road surface and began a counterclockwise rotation. V2 crossed the centerline and into the path of V1. The driver of V1 could not avoid V2 and the front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in a T-type configuration. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 90 degrees and came to rest in the eastbound lane facing south. After impact, V2 rotated clockwise approximately 90 degrees and came to rest on the south shoulder of the road, facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 18-year-old female driver of V2 was using the available three-point seat belt and the frontal-impact airbags deployed but she was fatally injured and pronounced at the scene (ISS-75). The 51-year-old driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a local hospital and treated for unknown injuries. The 49-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was also airlifted to a local hospital and later tranferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
