This moderate severity near-side impact crash involved a 26 year old male front right passenger who was belted and the side impact seatback and roof curtain airbags deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to the trauma center. This off road side impact crash into a utility pole occurred at night with street lights and clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Volkswagen Jetta four door sedan was traveling northbound on a two way, two lane residential street that had no shoulders but was bordered with grassy lawn areas. V1 was travelling in the northbound lane at a high rate of speed through a curve to the left with a slight down grade. Just after the curve V1 departed the roadway to the right leaving tire marks from the right tires in the grassy area. V1 then began to rotate counterclockwise and returned to the roadway leaving tire marks across the pavement as it began to slide sideways. V1 then departed the street to the left and continued to slide laterally for a short distance before the right side of V1 impacted the pole at the right second row door. The front of V1 then swiped a large tree (a minor impact). V1 then rotated clockwise 160 degrees and V1's left rear contacted the large tree too. V1 then came to final rest just beyond this pole and tree facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the front right passenger who is a 26 year old male. He was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and both side impact seatback and roof rail curtain airbags deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. The 21 year old male driver was the only other occupant in the vehicle. He was restrained with the lap/shoulder seatbelt and sustained minor injuries.
