This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 45 year old male driver of a 1999 Dodge Caravan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1998 GMC Safari minivan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a right curve. Vehicle 2 was northbound on the same roadway and entering the left curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. As Vehicle 1 reached the apex of the curve, the driver allowed the vehicle to cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 entered the northbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 2 resulting in moderate damage. At this point, both vehicles rotated counterclockwise. Vehicle 1 came to rest along the west shoulder facing northwest as Vehicle 2 came to rest along the east shoulder facing southwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
