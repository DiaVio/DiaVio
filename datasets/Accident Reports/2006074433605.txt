Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Ford F-150 with two restrained occupants, was traveling north in the #1 curb lane with the intention of negotiating a left curving roadway. According to the driver, a 41-year-old female, she was talking to the right front male passenger friend who was giving her directions. This was the first time she had driven the roadway and was unfamiliar with it. As she was negotiating a left hand curve the vehicle departed the right side of the roadway and the driver applied the brakes. The vehicle continued in a straight path off the roadway and impacted a chain link fence with its front plane. The fence also did damage to the top of the cab and the left side. After traveling through the fence the front of the vehicle impacted a large tree. The vehicle rotated slightly counter-clockwise and came to rest against the tree. V1 was towed due to damage and both occupants transported to hospital for injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver stated she was at home when she received a phone call from her friend who was at a bar and in need of a ride home due to being intoxicated. Driver proceeded to pick the friend up and had a drink at the bar where she picked up her friend. After that, they proceeded to another bar where the driver stated she had just one more drink before leaving for the passenger's home. Within about five minutes of departing the second bar, the driver made the right roadside departure and collided through a residential chain link fence and then into the tree. During a second interview with the driver, the driver stated she realized she was going too fast for the curve while talking to passenger. She also indicated she may have been looking at the front passenger before the roadside departure occurred. A contributing factor for this driver was the consumption of alcohol, for which she had BAC test result of 0.231. Vehicle dynamics suggest she was going too fast for this curve.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 is coded as "this vehicle traveling: off the edge of the road on the right side" and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event is coded as "driver related: internal distraction".
