Vehicle One (V1), a 1999 Kia Sephia sedan, was traveling north in lane two of an five lane, divided traffic way under dry, dark conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle Two (V2), a 1999 Lincoln Town Car sedan, was traveling south on the same roadway in the single left turn lane that is seperated from the other thru lanes via a curbed median and was approaching the same intersection. As V2 proceeded to trun left at the interesection, the front of V1 contacted the left side of V2. As a result of this impact, V1 rotated clockwise and V2 rotated counter-clockwise resulting in a secondary side-slap impact to the left quarter-panel area of V1. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case study occupant and driver of V1 was a 24-year-old female. She was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy in her vehicle. She was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
