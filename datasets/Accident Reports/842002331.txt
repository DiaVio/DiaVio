This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 47 year old female driver of a 2002 Nissan Frontier XE 4x2 King Cab pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree (event #4). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two lane rural roadway and proceeding straight. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 departed the right (east) pavement edge in a forward tracking mode and subsequently entered a wooded area. As the vehicle entered the wooded area, the frontal area made initial contact to some roadside brush resulting in minor damage (event #1). The vehicle continued in a northeasterly direction and the front left area struck a small diameter tree, which resulted in overlapping minor damage (event #2). The right front wheel struck a downed tree trunk, resulting in moderate damage (event #3). The front right area impacted a large diameter tree, which resulted in moderate damage (event #4). At this point, V1 rotated clockwise and came to rest in close proximity to the final tree impact facing northeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
