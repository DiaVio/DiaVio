This moderate severity single vehicle near-sided impact crash involved a 27 year-old male driver who was restrained with the lap/shoulder belt with side impact seatback-mounted and roof curtain airbag deployments. This driver sustained severe injuries and was transported to a trauma center. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions on a three lane, two way highway. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Mazda RX8 coupe, was eastbound in lane one of the two eastbound lanes and negotiating a curve to the right at a high rate of speed. After the curve, V1 crossed over the centerline into the westbound lane and began to rotate slightly clockwise as the left side back and then the left side front struck the face of a steel guardrail that borders the north side of the highway. V1 continued to rotate clockwise as it returned into the westbound lane and then crossed both eastbound lanes. V1, then sliding almost laterally, departed the roadway to the right into the ditch and the left side of V1 impacted a large rock on an embankment. After this impact, V1 then rotated 180 degrees and came to final rest facing east in the ditch. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver, a 27 year-old male, is the case occupant and was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and both the side impact seatback-mounted and roof side curtain air bags deployed. He was transported with severe injuries to the trauma center. No other passengers were in V1.
