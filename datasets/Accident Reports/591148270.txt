This case involved the forty-five year old, male driver of a pickup responding to an eight quarter-turn, right side leading rollover (trip) sequence. The subject was using the integrated lap and shoulder belt. The vehicle was not equipped with side air bags and the frontal-impact air bags did not deploy. The non-horizontal direction of force impact to the top/left greenhouse area resulted in a 'severe' vehicle damage estimate while the subject received moderate injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred on the westbound side of a, divided, four-lane interstate traveling through a rural area. The two lanes for westbound travel were divided from the eastbound lanes by a natural median with a shallow depression. The westbound lanes were situated at a slightly higher elevation than the eastbound. For westbound travel the lanes curved right with a slight uphill grade. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry during the dusk-time crash. The case vehicle (2003 Chevrolet 1500HD Silverado, 4-door pickup) was traveling westbound in the left lane. The vehicle was equipped with first row, outboard, integrated-lap and shoulder belt seats, and frontal-impact air bags. The 45-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, based on its post-crash position, found. There were two dogs in the cab, second row, at undetermined locations prior to overturn. The subject was fatigued and allowed the vehicle to drift across the center line and right lane until the vehicle's right front wheel(s) traveled off of the right roadside. The driver became alert at this and steered left abruptly. The vehicle entered into an ever-increasing, counterclockwise, yaw, carrying the vehicle back across the roadway to the left. The vehicle exited the left (south) roadside leading with its right plane. Scene evidence suggests that the vehicle tripped to the right as it crossed a, mountable, raised curb. The vehicle over-turned eight quarter-turns, landing first with its top-left roof rail/A-pillar. The vehicle came to rest on its wheels on the opposite side of the median, the eastbound median shoulder, facing east. The vehicle was towed due to disabling greenhouse and wheel damage. The driver (subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to moderate injuries. One dog died during the rollover sequence.
