This case involves a moderate impact to the right side of the case vehicle (far-side relative to the case occupant) with a passenger car. The case occupant is the 57-year-old male driver. He was not restrained by a three-point belt, but both frontal-impact air bags deployed. The case vehicle a 2003 Kia Rio four-door sedan was westbound on a wet, level, asphalt traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle Two (V2) a 1997 Toyota Tercel two-door coupe was eastbound on the same traffic-way, approaching the same intersection. It was dark, but lighted and snowing. As the case vehicle was turning left it entered the path of V2, the front of V2 struck the right fender of the case vehicle, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and V2 to rotate clockwise. The case vehicle came to rest in the southeast corner of the intersection. V2 came to rest facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 57-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He was not restrained by a 3-point-belt, but the steering-wheel and mid-instrument panel air bags deployed. He initially refused treatment, but was admitted to a level-one trauma center four hours post-crash and enrolled as a case occupant.
