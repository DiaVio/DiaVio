This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 25 year old male driver of a 2003 Honda Civic LX 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree (event #2). Vehicle 1 was northbound in the outboard lane of a multi-lane divided interstate highway and negotiating a left curve. It was dark (street not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. While negotiating the curve, Vehicle 1 approached a slower moving (non-contact) vehicle in the same lane ahead. The driver steered left in avoidance of the slower vehicle ahead, which re-directed Vehicle 1 into the northbound inboard travel lane. Vehicle 1 traversed the inboard lane and subsequently departed the left (west) road edge into the center median area. Vehicle 1 continued northwest into the center median and penetrated a heavily wooded area. As Vehicle 1 entered the wooded area, the front right area sideswiped a small tree resulting in minor damage (event #1). The front right area impacted a large diameter tree which resulted in moderate damage (event #2). Vehicle 1 sustained contact with the struck tree (longitudinally down the right side surface) until maximum engagement was reached at the area of the right front wheel. This induced a clockwise vehicle rotation as the struck tree was then sheared. The trunk of the sheared tree subsequently struck the rear roof and trunk areas resulting in minor, non-horizontal damage (event #3). At this point, the vehicle's clockwise rotation continued as the front (center) area struck another large diameter tree (event #4) which resulted in (overlapping) moderate damage. The front left area impacted a small tree (event #5) resulting in additional (overlapping) minor damage. The left rear side surface struck a small tree (event #6) resulting in minor damage. The back left area subsequently struck a large diameter tree (event #7) which resulted in moderate damage. Vehicle 1 came to rest in the median wooded area against the final point of impact facing northeast. The unrestrained 25 year old male driver of the 2003 Honda Civic LX was presumed to be seated in an upright posture with the seat track adjusted to full rearward position. The lack of restraint usage was confirmed by concentration of occupant contact points documented along the vehicle interior, relative to the absence of loading evidence on the driver 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system. The initial sideswipe impact was minor in nature and probably did not produce an occupant kinematic response from the driver. At impact #2, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the knee bolster and deployed driver frontal airbag. Indentations, scuff marks, and panel fractures were identified on the left knee bolster. Interaction with the deployed driver frontal airbag was evidenced by the smudge marks documented on the membrane face. Loading of these frontal components continued as the vehicle sustained additional frontal impacts (impacts #4 & 5) during rotation to final rest. The driver loaded the center console, as evidenced by lateral deformation of this component to the right and downward displacement of the adjacent parking brake. At impact #7, the (out-of-position) driver initiated a rearward trajectory in response to the 6 o'clock impact force and possibly contacted the right front seatback, evidenced by the small indentation noted on the left inner aspect of the seatback taper. Following the crash, the driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center with serious injuries and admitted for treatment. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
