This case involves a passenger car that was struck on the right-rear door and quarter panel by another passenger car. Relative to the case occupant, the restrained driver, it was a 'far-side' impact. The case vehicle a 2015, four-door Kia Forte was traveling in the outside westbound lane, of a dry, four-lane divided traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection, on an up-hill grade. Vehicle two (V2) a 2002, four-door Mercedes C320 was eastbound on the same traffic-way, approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was turning left through the intersection it crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right-rear door and quarter panel of the case vehicle. Both vehicles rotated clockwise out of the intersection. V2 came to rest in the inside eastbound lane facing south-southeast and the case vehicle came to rest in the outside eastbound lane facing south-southeast. The restrained 31-year-old male driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed a steering-wheel mounted frontal-impact and roof side-rail and seat-back mounted air bags on the right side of the vehicle. He was transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
