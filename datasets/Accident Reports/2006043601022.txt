This single vehicle crash occurred on a weekday morning on the right roadside of a divided highway. The east/west highway consisted of four lanes in each direction divided by a grassy median flanked by paved shoulders and guardrails. The bituminous highway is straight and level with a posted speed limit of 105kmph (65 mph). The traffic flow was slightly slow as a heavy rain was failing, soaking the roadway with large puddles at the time of the crash.

V1, a 1999 Ford Expedition XLT with one occupant was traveling west in lane one. As it drove over a puddle of water, it began to hydroplane, and rotate clockwise. V1 departed the roadway to the right, struck and drove over a steel guardrail and continued down an embankment. After driving over many small bushes and trees, V1 came to rest approximately 15m (49ft.) north of the roadway, facing west. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.
