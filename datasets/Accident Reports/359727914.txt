This frontal impact crash case involves an 80 year old female driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag and who sustained moderate severity injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours in a T-intersection. The north-south roadway consists of three asphalt travel lanes with a downhill grade for northbound vehicles. The east-west intersecting street consists of three asphalt travel lanes with a posted stop sign for eastbound vehicles. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry roadways. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Ford Edge four-door hatchback, was traveling north in lane one and was approaching the intersection, intending to make a left turn. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2010 Toyota FJ Cruiser compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in the southbound lane. V1 moved into the left turn only lane and began to turn left across V2's travel path. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and deployment of her frontal air bag. V1 traveled south while rotating counterclockwise and came to final rest in the southbound lane, facing southwest. V2 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest, near V1, facing southwest. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene. The case occupant is the 80 year old female driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated, and her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. She sustained moderate severity injuries and was transported to an outside hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. She was hospitalized for five days. The driver and one other passenger in V2 sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital, but their treatment status is unknown.
