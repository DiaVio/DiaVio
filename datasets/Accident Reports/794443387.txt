This case involves an impact between the right side of the case vehicle, a compact utility vehicle and the front end of a large pick-up truck. The case occupant is the restrained 69-year-old male driver of the compact utility vehicle. He had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel and top instrument panel mounted air bags. The case vehicle, a 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor SUV, was eastbound on a dry, uphill grade >2%, two-lane, asphalt road approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and clear. Vehicle two (V2) a 2011 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pick-up truck was northbound on the intersecting roadway approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle crossed though the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front-left bumper corner of V2 struck the right-front wheel of the case vehicle. After the primary impact the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and V2 rotated clockwise resulting in a 'side-slap' impact. The driver and the 60-year-old female right-front passenger were the only occupants of the case vehicle. Both occupants were restrained by a three-point belt and had the benefit of the deployed frontal-impact air bags. Both occupants were transported to an outside hospital and later transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries. The driver was enrolled as a case occupant.
