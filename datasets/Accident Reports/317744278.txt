This case involves a 69-year-old female who was 160 centimeters (5 foot 3 inches) tall and weighed 95 kilograms (210 pounds). She was the belted driver of a 2015 Ford Fusion four-door sedan that was involved in near side impact to the left fender. The left side of the case vehicle was contacted by the front of a 2006 GMC Sierra large pickup truck. The principal direction of force was 9 o'clock. The left outboard seat mounted airbag and left side curtain both deployed during the crash. There was also a fatality of the right front passenger who was also belted in the case vehicle; however, this case focuses on the driver. On impact the case occupant moved outboard and slightly rearward in relationship to the vehicle. The basilar skull fracture and the posterior vault fracture were both attributed to the head contacting the B-pillar. The medulla laceration and the atlanto-occipital dislocation were also attributed to contact with the B-pillar, with contact to the headrest of the driver's seat another possibility. The multiple rib fractures, lung lacerations, hemothorax, and sternum fracture were attributed to contact with the left seatback side bolster or the B-pillar via the left side curtain airbag. The splenic laceration was also attributed to contact with the left seatback side bolster or the B-pillar via the left side curtain airbag. A right side pelvic fracture was attributed to left hip contact with the left side seatback bolster or the rear lower quadrant of the left door. All injuries were sustained during the initial left side impact.
