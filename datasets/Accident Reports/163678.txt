Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 DuraMax diesel, 4-door pickup was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear and the asphalt road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and as V1 entered a left curve, the vehicle continued straight and the right side wheels ran off the right side of the road. The driver then awoke and steered left to regain control but he drove across both lanes and departed the left side of the road where the front of V1 struck the junction of a guardrail and the end of a bridge rail. V1 came to rest against the bridge rail facing north. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 29-year-old driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. He was transported via air ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
