Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 67-year-old unbelted female driver of a 2011 Hyundai Sonata 4-door sedan, which was primarily involved in a frontal impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours (dark, street lights present), of a spring weekday, on a one-way, bituminous single-lane access ramp, within the area of an interchange. This single access ramp lane runs primarily west and connects an east/west trafficway with a north/south trafficway. At the area of the crash, the ramp lane has a positively graded left turning curve. At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The ramp/interchange area has a speed limit of 45 mph (72 km/h) and the overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2011 Hyundai Sonata 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 67-year-old female driver (case occupant) in the westbound ramp lane, within the interchange. The driver of Vehicle 1 was unbelted, but the case vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags, seat back mounted side impact air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the curved section of roadway and continue traveling west to access the north/south trafficway. Crash: As Vehicle 1 negotiated the graded and curved section of roadway, it drifted right and departed the north edge of the roadway. At this time, Vehicle 1's right front wheel and right rear wheel struck the curb located at the roadway edge (events 1 and 2). Vehicle 1 continued to travel off the north side of the roadway and struck small trees/shrubs/branches with its frontal plane (front right and right A-pillar areas) with subsequent sideswiping down the right side plane (event 3). Vehicle 1 continued on an eventually struck a tree (bifurcated-yielding) with its frontal plane (event 4) and came to rest, at the tree impact location, off the north side of the roadway, facing a northwesterly direction. As a result of the tree impact (event 4), Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a local hospital, but was subsequently transferred to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
