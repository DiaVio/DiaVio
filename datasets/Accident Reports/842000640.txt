This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 54 year old female front right passenger of a 2005 Dodge Caravan SXT minivan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a right side impact with a large diameter tree (event #1). The case vehicle was also equipped with a knee bolster air bag for the driver position which deployed as a result of the crash. Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two lane rural roadway and entering a left curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 subsequently departed the right (west) pavement edge in a counterclockwise rotation. As Vehicle 1 departed the west pavement edge, the right side surface impacted a large diameter tree resulting in moderate damage (event #1). This initial impact reversed the vehicle's pre-impact rotation as it spun clockwise into a second cluster of trees. At this point, the front right area swiped a small diameter tree which resulted in minor damage (event #2). Vehicle 1's clockwise rotation continued as the left front side surface impacted a small diameter tree, resulting in additional minor damage (event #3). Vehicle 1 came to rest against the final impact (off the west pavement edge) facing west. Both occupants of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage. The vehicle was driven by a restrained 50 year old female. The 54 year old female front right passenger (case occupant) was 163 cm (5' 4") in height and 73 kg (165 lbs) in weight. The case occupant sustained injuries with a MAIS of 3 and an ISS of 22. It should be noted that the case occupant was not included on the police report.
