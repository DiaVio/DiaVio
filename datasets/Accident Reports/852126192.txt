This single vehicle rollover collision occurred on a divided freeway during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Chevrolet Express Van was westbound in lane two of the two westbound lanes. V1 departed the roadway to the left on to the soft gravel shoulder. The driver of V1 then steered to the right back on to the roadway with V1 rotating slightly clockwise. Once back on the roadway V1 straightened out briefly across both lanes at a northwest angle. V1 then began to rotate the opposite direction, counterclockwise, on the north paved shoulder with the back tires going off the north edge of the roadway on the soft gravel shoulder. V1 then rotated counterclockwise almost 60 degrees and the right rear tire dug deeper into the soft gravel that then tripped V1 into a roll over to the right. The right side came down and scraped on the paved shoulder before it flipped up on to the roof and then landed on to all four tires on the gravel shoulder. V1 then appeared to land on all four tires that bounced V1 upward before landing on the tires again at final rest facing west on the gravel shoulder. V1 was damaged and towed. The case vehicle had two occupants with the driver being the case occupant. The case driver was a 50 year old man who was wearing the lap and shoulder belt. This case driver sustained serious injuries and was transferred to the trauma center. The front right passenger was a 46 year old male who was wearing the lap and shoulder belt and sustained moderate injuries and was treated at a local hospital.
