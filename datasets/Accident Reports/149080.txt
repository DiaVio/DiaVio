Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Chevrolet Cobalt, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 steered left in an attempt to avoid an animal (deer) that was in the road but struck and killed the deer (event one). V1 crossed the centerline, eastbound lane, and the left wheels of V1 ran off the left side of the road. The driver of V1 steered right, causing V1 to re-enter the road but in a clockwise yaw/rotation. V1 crossed both lanes of the road while V1 continued to rotate clockwise and departed the right (north) side of the road. The ditch on this side of the road has an abrupt slope and the ditch is 3 meters below the grade of the road. As V1 departed the north road edge, the left side tires tripped on the grassy sod and V1 began a four-quarter turn rollover (event two). V1 came to rest on its wheels facing east-northeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 70-year-old male driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries.
