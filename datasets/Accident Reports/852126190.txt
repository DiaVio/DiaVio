This 88-year-old male (178 cm/86kg, 5 '10"/190lbs) was the second row right passenger of a 2006 Ford Five Hundred four-door sedan that was involved in a moderate frontal impact collision. This case occupant was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and was also found to be using a seat belt extender. This extender attached to the latch plate that then extended to the buckle point. On impact the driver moved forward in response to a 12 o'clock direction of force. The seat belt has some loading on the webbing but the extender of the lap belt allowed the body to buckle over the belt. The head appeared to contact the back of the front seat that was found deformed.



This patient sustained a closed head injury and multiple left sided rib fractures and bilateral pulmonary contusions. The head injury was due to impact the seat back with evidence of contact at this point. This was rated as certain. The chest injuries were due to chest compression by the seat belt, which appeared to be inappropriately positioned due to the use of a seat belt extender. The patient's age was also a contributing factor in the development of so many rib fractures with this mechanism. This mechanism was also rated as certain.
