This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 45-year-old male unbelted driver with a deployed frontal airbag. This occupant was driving a 2007 Pontiac G5 compact coupe when he sustained serious injuries in a front plane right-angle crash with a large utility vehicle. The crash occurred late afternoon on a dry road under cloudy skies. A 2007 Pontiac G5 compact coupe (Vehicle 1) was traveling southeast on a two-way, six-lane urban traffic way on a level grade. A 2005 Acura MDX large utility vehicle (Vehicle 2) was stopped facing northeast at a parking lot exit on the same road V1 was traveling. The parking lot exit was controlled by a stop sign. V1 proceeded straight as V2 began turning left across V1's lane of travel. The front plane of V1 struck the left plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 rotated counter-clockwise 45 degrees and came to rest in the road. V2 rotated 45 degrees clockwise and traveled partially off the northeast corner of the intersection, coming to rest on the curb. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was operated by a 45-year-old male driver. He was unbelted with an actuated retractor pretensioner locking the belt in the unused position. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed. The available right front instrument panel airbag did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
