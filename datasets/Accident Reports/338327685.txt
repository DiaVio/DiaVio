This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 61-year-old, male driver with a deployed airbag. He sustained serious injuries in a near-side crash with a sport utility vehicle. There was also a belted, 51-year-old, male, right front passenger with a deployed airbag. He sustained minor injuries in the crash. The crash occurred midday in dry, clear weather. A 2007 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab pickup truck (v1) was traveling east turning left at an intersection. The roadway was suburban, bituminous, two-way, five-lane, and undivided. The grade was 7% uphill approaching the intersection. A 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicle (v2) was traveling south approaching the same intersection. A 2011 Ford F150 Super Cab pickup truck (v3) was traveling west turning left at the intersection. As v1 turned left, it was struck on the left plane by the front plane of v2 (Event 1). V1 then rotated 15 degrees before rolling over onto its right side (Event 2). The top of v1 was immediately struck by the front plane of v3 (Event 3) and then sideswiped by the right plane of v3 (Event 4). All vehicles came to rest in the roadway. V1 and v2 were towed due to damage. V3 continued in service. V1 was driven by a 61-year-old male case occupant driver who was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt. The retractor pretensioner actuated and the steering wheel hub airbag deployed. There were no other available airbags for this position. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance where he was diagnosed with serious injuries. V1 was also occupied by a 51-year-old male who was not a case occupant. He was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner and a deployed instrument panel airbag. He was taken to a local trauma center with police-reported non-incapacitating injuries, where he was treated and released.
