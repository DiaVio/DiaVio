This single vehicle crash occurred during the daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer four door sedan, was northbound on a two lane, two way level street, drifted to the right and departed the roadway. The front of V1 impacted a utility pole and a smaller pole adjacent. V1 then rotated counterclockwise after impacting the utility pole and the right side quarter panel contacted a fence where it came to final rest facing northwest. V1 was damaged and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only person in V1. This case driver is a 46 year old female who was wearing a manual lap and shoulder belt with the belt pre-tensioners firing on impact and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center.
