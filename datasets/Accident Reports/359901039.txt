This minor off road crash into a ditch involved a 39 year old pregnant female driver who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt, with left seat back side air bag and left curtain airbag deployments. She sustained serious injuries in the crash. This single vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a divided freeway during daylight hours and under clear weather conditions. This section of the roadway consists of two southbound lanes with paved shoulders present. The driver was approaching a hillcrest where there was a bridge overpass with guardrails bordering both sides. The surface of this overpass had become frosty and icy. Just south of the bridge is a single lane on ramp that merges into the southbound lanes. The gore point area between the southbound lanes and the on ramp consists of a grassy flat area with a ditch bordering the east edge of the ramp. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Cadillac CTS four door sedan was travelling in lane one of the southbound lanes and was traveling across the bridge overpass. V1 then lost control on the icy roadway and began to rotate clockwise. V1 crossed over the west shoulder and departed the roadway to the right. V1 then continued to rotate on the grassy area and slid laterally into the ditch bordering the on ramp. V1's entire undercarriage and left sill area contacted the opposite side of the ditch, resulting in a non-horizontal impact to V1. V1 rotated clockwise out of the ditch and came to final rest facing east across the on ramp lane. V1 was towed from the scene. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. She was reported to be 32 weeks pregnant. On impact, her left seat back outboard mounted side air bag and left roof side rail mounted curtain airbag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital for treatment before being transported to the trauma center where she was hospitalized. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
