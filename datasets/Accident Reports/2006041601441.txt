It was a weekday afternoon and the skies were clear. The roadway was dry and straight with more than a 2 percent downhill grade. The posted speed was 56 KMPH (35 MPH).

Vehicle 1 was a 1990 Honda Accord that was traveling in lane one going approximately 40 KMPH (25 mph). The driver of V1, a 50-year old female, was looking to her left, talking to a driver in the adjacent lane.
