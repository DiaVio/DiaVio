This case involves two vehicles engaged in a T-bone type crash. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2004 Pontiac Montana minivan that was struck in the left side by the front of a 1998 Chevrolet regular cab four wheel drive pickup truck (V2). The crash occurred at the intersection during daylight hours. There were no adverse weather conditions and the asphalt roadway was dry. V1 was traveling west on the two-way roadway approaching the intersection. The intersection was controlled by stop signs for the east/west lanes. V2 was traveling north in the right lane of a three-lane roadway with the center lane used for left turns only. There were no traffic controls for the north/south travel lanes. The driver of V1 pulled up to the intersection and came to a stop before proceeding into the intersection. V2 entered the intersection just as V1 was crossing over to travel straight through the intersection. The front of V2 struck V1 in the left front and rear door area. The impact pushed the case vehicle (V1) sideways and forward of the point of impact into the turn lane on the north side of the intersection for final rest. The other vehicle (V2) came to rest in the intersection just forward of impact facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The case subject is the 58 year old female driver of the Pontiac Montana who was restrained by the 3-point available lap and shoulder belt. A 12 year old male was seated in the right front passenger seat and was also restrained by a lap and shoulder belt. There were no side impact airbags available in this vehicle and the frontal bags did not deploy. The driver and right front passenger of the case vehicle were transported to a local hospital for treatment. The 12 year old male was released from the emergency department with no visible injuries. The case subject was later transferred to a level one trauma center and subsequently hospitalized for injuries sustained in the crash.
