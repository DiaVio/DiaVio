The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a dry, divided, 113 Kph (70Mph), four-lane highway. The conditions at the time of the crash were clear skies during daylight hours. A median wall separated the north and southbound lanes.

The driver of V1, a 2005 Buick Lesabre, stated that she was attempting to merge into the left lane from the right lane, but that the left lane was already occupied. She overcorrected and exited the right side of the roadway, then overcorrected again, lost control, reentered the roadway and traveled across the roadway and off the left side. V1 began to rotate clockwise and the right rear of the vehicle contacted the concrete median. After the initial impact, the vehicle then traveled back across the roadway and departed the right side before contacting a bridge support with its front end. The vehicle was towed due to damage, but the driver was uninjured. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
