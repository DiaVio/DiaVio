This case focuses on a restrained 43-year-old female driver in a 2008 Honda Accord sedan (V1). There was also a 3-year-old female occupant in the rear right seating position of V1. This occupant was seated in a booster seat restrained using the lap and shoulder seatbelt. V2 was equipped with dual side curtains and dual frontal and side airbags. There was also a 2006 Dodge Caravan minivan (V2) and a 2013 Kia Optima sedan (V3) involved in the crash. V1 was traveling southbound on a dry, two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway while negotiating a left hand curve. V2 was traveling northbound on the same dry, two-way, two-lane asphalt roadway as V1. The driver of V2 was negotiating a right hand curve. V3 was traveling ahead of V1 also heading southbound on the same roadway while negotiating the same left hand curve as V1. The crash occurred during the daylight hours and the weather was clear. The posted speed limit was 48 kph (30 mph). The northbound lane had a negative slope and the southbound lane had a positive slope. V2 was traveling northbound when it drifted out of its travel lane onto the right roadside. The driver of V2 steered left in an attempt to maneuver his vehicle back into its travel lane. This maneuver caused V2 to re-enter its lane and then cross the center lane line. The front left corner of V2 contacted the left fender of V3. After impact, V2 continued north in the southbound lane where it met V1. The front of V2 contacted the front of V1. V2 was pushed rearward and came to rest facing northwest while straddling the north and south lanes. V1 came to rest near impact while in the southbound lane, facing south. V3 came to rest near its impact area with V2, facing southeast. All three vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance and taken to a level one trauma center and treated for serious injuries that she sustained. The right rear passenger was treated and released at a children's level one trauma center.
