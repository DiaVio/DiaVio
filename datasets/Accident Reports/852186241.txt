This frontal impact crash case involves a 20 year old male driver, wearing an add-on 4-point competition racing harness, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours on a five lane, two way roadway. The north-south roadway consists of two northbound, two southbound and one center left turn only lane that are straight, level and comprised of asphalt. There are curbs and business driveways on either side of the roadway. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry roadways. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Subaru Impreza four door sedan, was traveling north in lane one and vehicle 2 (V2), a 2003 Chevrolet unknown model medium/heavy truck, was entering the roadway from a business driveway located on the east side of the street. V2 began to turn left, intending to travel south. As V2 entered V1's lane of travel, the driver of V1 braked but the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. After the impact, V1 traveled a short distance north and came to final rest facing north in lane one. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the southbound lanes, facing southeast. V1 and V2 sustained disabling damage and were towed from the scene. The case occupant is the 20 year old male driver of V1 who was wearing an add-on 4-point competition racing harness, rather than the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. The front right passenger in V1 was a 22 year old female with a frontal instrument panel mounted air bag deployment. She was not wearing the available 3-point manual lap/shoulder belt or the available add-on 4-point competition racing harness. Her level of injury and treatment status is currently unknown.
