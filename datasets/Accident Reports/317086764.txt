This case involved a 36-year-old female, unrestrained, right front passenger of a 2009 Nissan Altima four- door sedan. She was 173 centimeters (68 inches) tall and weighed 105 kilograms (231 pounds) with a body mass index of 35.1. The case vehicle was involved in a severe level frontal impact with a 2002 Acura TL four-door sedan. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. There was a top instrument panel-mounted air bag that deployed in the front right passenger position. The case subject was pronounced dead at the scene by the Medical Examiner. She was riding in a fully reclined position and asleep. On impact the unrestrained case occupant moved forward and slightly to the left in relationship to the vehicle. She sustained an inferior vena cava laceration, bilateral hemothoraces, right diaphragm laceration, multiple rib fractures, and a pericardial sac laceration that were attributed to contact with the instrument panel under the airbag with a confidence of probable. She also sustained splenic lacerations, liver lacerations, stomach and colon lacerations that were all attributed to contact with the glove box with a confidence level of probable.
