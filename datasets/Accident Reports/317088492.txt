This case involved a 49 year old restrained male driver of a 2005 Ford Ranger Edge regular cab pickup truck (V1). There were two other vehicles involved in the crash, a 1998 Toyota Camry four-door sedan (V2) and a 1999 Honda Civic four-door sedan (V3). The driver of V1 was restrained by the 3-point safety belt, but the frontal airbag did not deploy. The crash occurred during daylight hours at a three leg intersection. V1 was traveling north at an unknown speed on a two-lane straight and level roadway intending to turn left onto the intersecting roadway. V2 and V3 were traveling east on the five-lane intersecting roadway at approximately 80 kph (50 mph) with a 2% downgrade. As V1 attempted to cross the eastbound lanes, it struck V2 in the right side with its frontal plane. V3 was following V2 in the left eastbound lane and swerved into the right lane to try and avoid the crash. The front of V3 struck the lower left door area of V1 pushing V1 approximately 33 meters before overturning onto its left side. V1 also rolled over one quarter turn to final rest next to V3. V2 came to rest in the westbound lanes. All three vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to the serious injuries he sustained in the crash.
