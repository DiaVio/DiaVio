This crash occurred at night with streetlights and clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Buick LeSabre 4-door sedan was westbound in lane two of a four lane, two way street with a very steep downgrade. Vehicle two (V2), a 1987 Ford Aerostar Van, had stopped in lane two at an uncontrolled intersection to make a left turn. The front of V1 then impacted the back of V2, forcing V2 to rotate counterclockwise 180 degrees across the opposite lanes. V2 then came to final rest facing east against the south curb just west of the intersection. After the impact with V2 in lane two, V1 continued down the steep graded street for one block drifting gradually to the right across lane one and then departed off the roadway right at the northwest corner of the next uncontrolled intersection where the front of V1 struck a small sign post, an small electrical box, and then the front left corner impacted a light pole. V1 came to final rest up against the light pole. The electric box was pushed into a chain link fence which V1 did not contact. Both vehicles were damaged and towed from the scene. Due to the steep downgrade of the street when V1 was towed the front was pulled to the south away from the light pole and then V1 started to roll down the hill which scraped down the right side of V1 into the light pole. The case occupants in V1 included both the driver and front right passenger. No other occupants were in V1. The case driver was a 86 year old male who was restrained properly with a manual lap/shoulder belt and the steering column mounted air bag deployed on the first event with V2. The case driver was transported to the trauma with serious injuries. The case occupant (front right passenger) was a 81 year old female who was not using a seat belt and had an instrument panel mounted air bag deployment only for the first event impact with V2. This case occupant was also transported to the trauma center with critical injuries.
