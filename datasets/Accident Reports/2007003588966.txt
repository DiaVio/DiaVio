The crash occurred in the intersection of two roadways. The north/south roadway was two-way with one lane in each direction and had a downhill grade of 2 percent. The eastbound roadway was one way with one lane of travel and also had a downhill grade of 2 percent. These were straight and bituminous roadways with a posted speed of 48kmph (30mph). The eastbound roadway was controlled by a stop sign, while the north/south roadway had no traffic control device. It was the afternoon hours of a weekday, and the roads were dry and the sky was cloudy.

V3, a 2002 Chrysler 300M four door, was parked and unoccupied in the parking lane of the northbound roadway. At the intersection, the front of V2 impacted the left front side of V2, and then the two vehicles impacted in a side slap formation with the right side of V2 contacting the left side of V1. Then the front of V2 contacted the back of V3, and the front of V1 contacted a fence on the northeast corner of the intersection. V1 came to a final rest on the northeast sidewalk.
