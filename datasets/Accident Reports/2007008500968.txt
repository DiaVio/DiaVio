This crash occurred on a two-lane undivided roadway. The roadway curved to the left before straightening out, had a downhill grade, was bituminous, and had a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). It was early afternoon on a holiday weekend and conditions were clear.

V1 was a 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier, driven by a 21 year-old female. V1 was traveling southbound in lane one and had just finished negotiating a curve, when a rabbit ran in front of the vehicle. The driver swerved to the right to avoid the rabbit and traveled up the right side embankment. While traveling up the embankment the vehicle struck a utility pole guide wire, and then rolled over to the left, completing two quarter turns, and landing on its roof back in lane one. Police Reported Travel Speed is 56 kmph for V1.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was “object or animal, animal in the roadway.” The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was “driver related factor, incorrect evasive action.” Had the driver not swerved so severely, the vehicle would not have traveled off of the road edge, and would not have rolled-over.
