This crash occurred on a two-lane roadway in the early morning of a weekend. The roadway curves to the left with a downhill to uphill slope, and had a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). There is an advisory speed limit of 32 kmph (20 mph) for a sharp curve. The roadway was mostly covered with snow and ice, the sky was clear, and it was dark.

V1 was a 1999 Hyundai Sonata driven by a 16 year-old female. V1 was traveling in lane one negotiating the left hand curve when it lost traction. V1 crossed over the lane line on the left and continued off of the left road edge and up an embankment where it impacted a telephone pole and came to final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle control loss due to: poor road conditions, icy roads." The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was "driver related factor, too fast for conditions." One associated factor is driver inexperience. The driver had been driving for about a month prior to this crash. She stated that she was traveling between 20 and 30 mph, which is within the bounds of the posted speed limit. However it appears that she did not take into account the advisory speed limit and the change in road conditions. This section of the road was covered in snow and ice. At the time of the crash most other roadways were clear. This particular roadway is not a main road and therefore does not receive maintenance as quickly as other roads.
