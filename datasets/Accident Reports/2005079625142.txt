This three-vehicle collision occurred during night hours on a weekday. The crash occurred on straight stretch of a north-south, five-lane, two-way, undivided, dry, level, bituminous roadway, approaching the T-intersection of an east-west road that intersects the west curb. A bicycle lane borders the first lanes in each direction. The speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph), and the T-intersection was controlled by a tri-light traffic signal. At the time of the crash, there were no adverse atmospheric conditions and the roadway was free of defects.
