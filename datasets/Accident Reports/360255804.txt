This frontal crash case involves a 69 year old female driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Mercedes-Benz C300 four door sedan, was northbound in lane one of a four lane, two way concrete roadway with curbs present on both sides. In V1's precrash area the northbound lane curves to the left with a level grade. V1 was negotiating the curve when it departed the lane to the right, resulting in the right tires scraping against the curb several times. Near the end of the curve, V1 veered to the left, crossed over all four traffic lanes and then V1's front left tire impacted the curb, resulting in minor damage. V1 climbed over the curb, departed the roadway, traveled over a grassy area with an uphill slope, and headed towards some trees. Then V1's front left impacted a small tree, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued a short distance and its front impacted another tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag. V1 rotated counterclockwise, rolled backwards down the slope and came to final rest facing southwest with its front end off the roadway and its back end in the outside lane. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 69 year old female, who was not restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the third crash event. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
