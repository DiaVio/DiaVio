The accident this day took place on a two-lane, undivided north/south roadway at a T-intersection with an east/west roadway. The east/west roadway intersected the north/south roadway at about a 25-30 degree angle. The east/west roadway was controlled by a stop sign, while the north/south roadway had no traffic control device. The posted speed limit on the north/south roadway was 40 kmph (25 mph), and the east/west roadway was posted at 32 kmph (20 mph). V1, a 1996 Ford Taurus, was traveling north. V2, a 1995 Isuzu Rodeo, was traveling west. At the time of the crash, it was raining heavily and the roadway was wet.

The driver of V1, a male of unknown age, was driving his two daughters to school. He stated that he was following a non-contact vehicle as he approached the T-intersection. The driver of V1 stated that the vehicle in front of him made a right hand turn into the eastbound roadway. The driver of V1 attempted to go around the non-contact vehicle as it made its right turn. As he did so, V2, which had been stopped facing west at the stop sign, pulled out onto the north/south roadway, intending to turn left. The left front corner of V1 impacted the left rear side of V2. After being struck by V1, V2 was rotated in a counterclockwise direction, striking a utility pole aft the "C" pillar on the right side of the vehicle. V2 came to rest against the pole facing east. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to this driver include the non-contact vehicle in front of V1 that partially blocked V1's driver from seeing the actions of V2, the heavy rain, and the wet roadway. The driver of V1 stated that one of his daughters had a school trip that day and that was why he was driving them to school. The driver stated that the two children were belted and secured in the back seat and were not causing any distraction at time of the accident.

This researcher was unable to get in contact with the driver of V2, a 25-year old female. The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V2 was coded as "This vehicle turning left at intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to this vehicle was "type of driver error unknown." This was chosen because of the absence of an interview with the driver of V2. Due to the lack of an interview, the only known associated factors that were coded to this driver were the weather (the heavy rain) and the wet roadway.
