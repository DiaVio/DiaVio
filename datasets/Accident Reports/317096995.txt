This case involved a 57 year old restrained male driver of a 2007 Nissan Altima four door sedan (V1) that underrode the side of a 2007 Kenworth T600 tractor trailer truck. The driver was wearing the available three point safety belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. The right side seat mounted airbag and the right roof side rail mounted head curtain airbag also deployed. The left side impact airbags did not deploy. There were no other occupants in V1. The crash occurred at night on an unlit rural two lane roadway at a three leg intersection. The north/south roadway was straight and level and the eastbound intersecting roadway was straight with a 2% downhill grade. The eastbound roadway was controlled by a stop sigjn and the north/south roadway was uncontrolled. The asphalt roadways were dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit for both roadways was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was traveling east and V2 was going north. V1 made a left turn onto the intersecting roadway and ran under the trailer of V2. V1 was dragged under the trailer for approximately 35 meters before both vehicles came to rest on the east shoulder, still attached. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a level one trauma center.
