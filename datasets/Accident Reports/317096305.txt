This case involved a 20 year old restrained male driver of a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu four door sedan (V1). The driver of V1 was restrained by the manual lap and shoulder belt system and had a deployed frontal airbag. V1 was involved in a collision with the back of a 1998 Peterbilt tractor truck hauling a trailer loaded with logs. The crash occurred on a dark rural two-lane roadway under foggy conditions. The asphalt roadway was dry and was straight with a less than 2% downgrade at the area of impact. Both vehicles were traveling north with V2 ahead of V1. V2 began decelerating in order to turn left at an intersecting roadway. V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph) when it approached V2. V1 was unable to stop and struck the logs extending off the back of the trailer of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the northbound lane of the roadway. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V2 was driven from the scene following the crash. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of his injuries.
