This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear skies.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Volkswagen Jetta, was northbound in the second travel lane. A non-contact vehicle (NCV) was northbound in the first lane to the right of V1. V1 attempted to merge into the first lane when she heard a horn honk. The driver of V1 quickly steered back to the left and applied the brakes to avoid a collision. The driver lost control of the vehicle. V1 rotated clockwise, passed through lane one and the shoulder. The front of V1 struck the retaining wall on the east road edge. V1 continued to rotate and the left rear plane struck the wall before coming to rest on the shoulder facing south. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a twenty-one year-old female, was heading home from work. This driver had been driving for about fifteen minutes, drives the route daily and is familiar with the vehicle. The driver stated she had her turn signal on prior to initiating the lane change. The driver stated she had looked in her mirror prior to attempting to merge to the right, but failed to turn her head to look to her blind spot to insure the lane was clear.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on the right side of travel lane. The critical reason was coded: driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). This driver's overcompensation and poor directional control were associated factors in this crash.
