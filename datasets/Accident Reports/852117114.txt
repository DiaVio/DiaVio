This crash occurred at an intersection during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Chevrolet S10 Pickup truck was eastbound on two lane, two way highway with a posted speed limit of 50mph/80kmph traveling through the intersection with no traffic controls in this direction. V2, a 2001 Oldsmobile Alero, two door coupe, was southbound traveling through the intersection controlled by a stop sign. The front of V2 impacted the left side of V1 in the intersection which caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and rollover to the right. V1 rolled eight quarter turns on the paved south shoulder and partially in a deep ditch and then came to final rest completely in the ditch upright and facing north. V2 rotated and came to final rest facing southeast in the south part of the intersection. Both vehicles were disabled and towed. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 41 year old male, who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt and was transported to local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. No other occupants were in the case vehicle.
