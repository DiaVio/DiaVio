A two vehicle daytime T type collision occurred during a weekday morning at the intersection of an urban arterial road and a two-way neighborhood street. The intersection has stop signs controlling the east-west neighborhood traffic and both roads are straight, level and paved with bituminous asphalt. The speed limit for both roads is 48 kmph (30 mph). At the time of the crash the sky was cloudy but the road was dry.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Volvo S60 sedan with only a driver, was heading west into the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Honda Passport SUV with a driver and toddler in a child seat, was headed south on the arterial road. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1 at the rear passenger door and V1 spun clockwise out of the intersection. V1 then rolled backwards into the south curb on the west side of the intersection. V2 came to rest at the edge of the arterial road in the intersection, still facing south. V2 was driven to a nearby residence to be towed later. V1 was parked on the south curb to be towed later. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V1 was a 23-year-old female who reported no injuries from the crash. She stated that she was on her daily commute to work after stopping at daycare and still had Â½ hour before she needed to be at work. She had rolled through the stop sign in a "California stop," and had looked both directions for cars coming. She did not see any vehicles coming, and entered the intersection, where she was struck. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: This Vehicle Traveling, Crossing over (passing through) intersection. The critical reason for the critical event assigned to this driver as a driver recognition factor: Inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see). This indicates she did not have enough time to make an adequate perfunctory check for cross traffic prior to proceeding into the intersection. The driver of V1 stated that she entered the intersection at a reduced speed, but did not come to a complete stop. This indicates she did not have enough time to make an adequate perfunctory check for cross traffic prior to proceeding into the intersection. An associative factor of an illegal maneuver was assigned to V1 because the driver did not fully stop for the stop sign.

The driver of V2 was a 31-year old female who reported no injuries. There were no traffic controls for her direction of travel. She stated that she saw V1 coming along from the side road, and was able to react by braking. However, she was not able to stop in time, and was not sure if she had engaged the brakes fully. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: Other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street- across path. The critical reason for the critical event is not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors for V2 are work stress, and elevated stress from an argument (a "time out") from her 3-year-old daughter earlier that morning.
