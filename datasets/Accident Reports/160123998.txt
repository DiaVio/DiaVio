Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Nissan Maxima sedan, was traveling south in lane one of a four lane, divided trafficway under dry, daylight conditions. V2, a 1995 Ford Explorer four-door, was traveling south in lane two of the same roadway behind V1. V1 made a right turn into a private entrance to a parking lot, made a U-turn, and then attempted to make a left turn out of the private entrance to go north on the original roadway. As V1 made the left turn, the left of V1 contacted the front of V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant in V1, a 61-year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. No airbags deployed in V1. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
