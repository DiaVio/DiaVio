This case occupant is a 26 year old female driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a single vehicle frontal crash with a frontal impact air bag deployment and who sustained multiple moderate severity injuries. This crash occurred during early morning hours in darkness, clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Alero four door sedan, was northbound in lane one on a two lane, two way, asphalt roadway with a slight uphill grade for northbound traffic. There are gravel strips adjacent to the travel lanes. V1 was traveling north in lane one when the driver lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons. V1 departed the roadway to the right and traveled into the gravel strip. V1 continued north a short distance, then the driver of V1 steered left, V1 reentered lane one, but the driver overcorrected causing V1 to partially enter lane two. The driver of V1 steered right, traveled across lane one and departed the right side of the roadway a second time. V1 traveled a short distance off the roadway and the front of V1 struck a large tree, resulting in the deployment of both frontal air bags. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest completely off the roadway, facing east. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 26 year old female, who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained multiple moderate severity injuries and was transported to a local hospital prior to being transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
