This severe frontal sideswipe type crash involved a 70 year old male driver who sustained severe injuries and was wearing the available lap/shoulder belt with pretensioner and a frontal airbag deployed. This crash occurred during cloudy daylight hours through a curve on a two lane, two way highway with clear, dry conditions. There were no shoulders in the curve and bordered by steel guard rails. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Lincoln Town Car four door sedan, was northbound negotiating this curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Kenworth truck pulling one trailer, was southbound and negotiating the same curve to the right. V2 departed the lane to the left in the curve and the back trailer began to slide laterally into the opposite lane. The front left corner of V1 impacted the left side of the trailer near the back tires. The damage to V1 extended down the left side of V1 and caused it to rotate counterclockwise on impact lifting the back end upward that then landed on top of the east side bordering guardrail. V1 came to final rest with the back third of V1 on the guardrail and front half still in the northbound lane facing northwest. V2 began to lock up the brakes post impact before coming to final rest over 100 meters south of the point of impact in the southbound lane with the left tires on the double dividing yellow line. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 70 year old male, who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt and the pretensioners actuated and the frontal steering column airbag deployed. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital before being transferred to the trauma center. A 57 year old female was the front right passenger and was wearing the lap/shoulder belt and the pretensioners actuated and the frontal instrument panel mounted airbag deployed. She sustained minor injuries and was transported and released from a local hospital. No other occupants were in V1.
