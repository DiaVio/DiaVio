The crash occurred on a fully controlled highway with two lanes in each direction divided by a metal guardrail. The straight, level, bituminous roadway has a posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph). Conditions at the time of the weekday afternoon crash were daylight, clear and dry.

V1, a 2002 Ford Explorer XLT 4 door sports utility vehicle driven by a 17 year-old male, was northbound on the highway in lane two, traveling at 70 mph. The driver was going from one hockey practice session to another rink and was running late. Traffic ahead in lane one started to slow down. The driver stated that a (non-contact) vehicle in lane one suddenly cut into lane two in front of him. The driver of V1 braked (full ABS application) and swerved right to avoid hitting him, went too far, then steered back left. The driver then steered back to the right, crossed lane one and the paved shoulder in a clockwise yaw, left the roadway on the right and rolled over 5 quarter turns down a 60% slope. V1 came to rest on the left side facing southwest and was towed from the scene due to damage. Cargo from the back area of the Explorer went out the broken backlight during the rollover. The fully restrained driver was transported to a local trauma center due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
