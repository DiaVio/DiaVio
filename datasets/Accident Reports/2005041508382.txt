The crash occurred at the interchange between two interstates. This was a one-way, two-lane, undivided entrance ramp with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). The level, bituminous roadway curved to the right. Conditions were daylight on a weekday morning with wet roads and cloudy skies.

V1, a 1995 Saturn SL with one occupant, was traveling southbound in lane two, approaching the curve. As the driver entered the curve, the vehicle began to slide on the wet pavement. The vehicle fishtailed, and the driver overcorrected to the left as he attempted to regain control of the vehicle. The vehicle began to rotate counterclockwise as it traveled into the concrete barrier wall. The front of V1 made contact with the wall. V1 continued to rotate until the right rear corner of the vehicle made contact with the barrier wall. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1, the Saturn SL, was driven by a 21-year old male who reported possible injuries, but refused treatment. He stated that he was on his way to work from home. His usual route was congested, so he decided to take another route to work. According to the driver, another vehicle cut him off. Supposedly, he swerved to avoid the other driver and lost control of his vehicle in the process.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was “this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side”. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a decision error, traveling too fast for conditions. The driver attempted to take the curve at a speed that was too fast for the wet roadway. One associated factor was trip related. The driver was in a hurry, due to being late for the start of a work shift. A possible associated factor for this driver might have been sleep related. The driver is normally drowsy when he wakes up, and the crash occurred just one hour after the driver awoke. Another associated factor was experience related. This was an alternate route for the driver, who had never been on this curve before. In addition, the driver overcompensated with regard to steering and braking inputs. Specifically, the driver used overcorrective steering in combination with aggressive braking on a wet surface. The wet surface condition itself was a roadway related factor for this crash. Finally, there was a vehicle related contributing factor. All of V1's tires were worn to a tread depth of two millimeters, and three of the four tires were severely underinflated.
