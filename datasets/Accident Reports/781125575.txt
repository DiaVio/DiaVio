This case involved the belted 44-year-old male driver with a deployed frontal airbag of a pickup responding to a frontal plane impact with a tree resulting in severe vehicle damage and serious injury. This single-vehicle crash occurred on an east/west three-lane trafficway. There was a single lane for each direction and a continuous turn-lane. The northern roadside was bordered by a raised curb, a sidewalk and chain-link fence. The south roadside consisted of a raised curb that gave way to a lower dirt shoulder, followed by a shallow, downward sloping embankment. At the bottom of the embankment were trees. Situated along the dirt shoulder was a small square, metal signpost holding warning signs. The weather was rainy and the bituminous trafficway wet during the early morning (dark-not lit) crash. The case vehicle (2005 Chevrolet C1500 Silverado 4-door pickup) was traveling westbound. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags (advanced). The 44-year-old driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. The subject was traveling westbound in the light rain and the rear of the vehicle began to slide from side to side (fishtail). The driver responded by steering to the left. The vehicle then suddenly regained traction and the vehicle began tracking at an angle diagonal to the trafficway. The vehicle traveled off of the left (south) roadside, striking down the small signpost with its front plane as it crossed the dirt shoulder. The vehicle traveled a few meters further at this trajectory where the front plane struck a large eucalyptus tree (offset right). The driver's frontal impact air bag deployed presumably as a result of this second impact. The vehicle came to rest against the tree without a significant degree of rotation. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury(s).
