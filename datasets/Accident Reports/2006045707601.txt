The crash occurred on a rural secondary arterial road that ran north/south, was two-way, two-lane and undivided. The roadway where the crash occurred was level with a curve right (east) if traveling north. There was a long straight northbound approach to the curve. The curve radius was 152m. The speed limit was 48kph (30mph). There was a residential side road intersecting from the east a few meters north of the curve apex. Conditions were overcast and wet on a weekday morning.

Vehicle #1 was a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt traveling north on the arterial road when as it began to negotiate the curve it began to decelerate then lost control and spun counterclockwise striking a pole on the left (west) side of the road just north of the intersecting side road. It (V1) came to rest at the pole after breaking the pole and moving it about a meter west. Vehicle #1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

Vehicle #1, was driven by a twenty one year old female, with no airbag deployment. She was uninjured in the crash. She claimed a non-contact vehicle pulled up to the intersection on the side road and appeared to be pulling out into her (driver V1) travel path.

The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was poor directional control. The driver was looking forward and right at what she believed was approaching traffic. She also said she had been in kind of a deep thought state just prior due to a recent family wide run of bad luck with accidents. False assumption was coded for her assumption that the vehicle that had just pulled up was coming out. She was in a hurry to get to school as she was running late and driving a vehicle unfamiliar to her (rental).
