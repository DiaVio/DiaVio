This case occupant is a 72 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a frontal air bag deployment. He was involved in a moderate frontal impact, followed by a moderate left side impact and he sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early evening hours in the southbound lanes of a five lane, one way, interstate freeway. At the time of the crash, it was dark with overhead street lights and there were overcast weather conditions and dry travel lanes. In the area where the crash occurred, the concrete travel lanes are straight with a slight uphill grade. There is a paved shoulder on the west side of the freeway, a narrow paved strip on the east side, and guardrails are present on both sides of the travel lanes. Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Ford Focus four door sedan, was southbound in lane three. Vehicle two (V2), a 2010 Chevrolet Impala four door sedan and Vehicle three (V3), a 2001 Toyota Sienna minivan, were also traveling south in lane three, and were ahead of V1's location. Vehicle four (V4), a 2013 Volkswagen Tiguan compact utility vehicle, was also traveling south in lane three, behind V1. All of the vehicles were approaching an area where there was a truck bed liner lying in lane three. V3 and V2 came to a stop in their lane. As V1 approached the stopped vehicles, the driver braked and steered right but V1's front impacted V2's back, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of the frontal air bags. The force of the impact moved V2 further south and the front of V2 impacted the back of V3. Both V2 and V3 moved a short distance south and came to final rest, facing southwest. After the initial crash event, V1 rotated counterclockwise and traveled into lane four. V4's driver steered right and also moved into lane four and the front of V4 impacted V1's left rear, resulting in moderate damage. V1 continued south and came to final rest straddling lanes four and five, facing northeast. V4 came to rest in lane five, near V1, facing southwest. V3 was able to be driven from the scene. V1, V2 and V4 were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is the 72 year old male driver who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the first crash event. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center where he was hospitalized for six days. No other occupants were in V1. Several of the occupants of the other vehicles sustained injuries, but it is not known if they sought medical treatment.
