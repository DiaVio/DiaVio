This case involves a 41 year old female driver 168 cm (66 inches) tall and weighing 179 kilograms (398 pounds). The case occupant was driving a 2004 Nissan Sentra (V1) that was involved in a moderate severity frontal crash with a 2001 Kenworth T800 moving van (V2). The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. The case occupant was not wearing the available three-point seat belt. The driver's frontal air bag and right front passenger air bags deployed as a result of the collision with V2. During the impact with V2 the case occupant moved directly forward. Her knees contacted the knee bolster causing her right tibia fracture. Due to her morbid obesity, she contacted and overloaded the driver air bag. She then loaded the steering wheel rim through the air bag causing her epigastric hematoma, left 3-8 rib fractures, right 6-8 rib fractures, abdominal contusion, sub capsular liver laceration, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. She continued to move forward and up over the air bag and steering wheel and her head contacted the windshield header causing her forehead laceration and possibly her concussion. During this time her lower legs were probably in contact with the knee bolster causing her bilateral lower leg contusions. As she rebounded back into her seat the posterior left portion of her head may have contacted the B-pillar possibly causing her concussion and subgaleal hematoma. The source and mechanism for her left shoulder contusion and right T1 transverse process fracture could not be determined.
