This case involved a belted driver responding to a non-horizontal frontal impact with air bag deployment, resulting in serious injury. This single vehicle crash occurred on a four-lane, divided, intra-city freeway traveling through a commercial/suburban area. The east/west trafficway had two lanes for travel in each direction divided by a wide, natural median. The eastbound roadway had an uphill grade with a gradual left curve. At the location of incident the trafficway passed over a surface street, approximately 9 meters below. The edge of the bridge overpass, on the median, was protected by a guardrail. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the morning (daylight) crash. The case vehicle (2003 Honda Odyssey, 4-door van) was traveling eastbound in the number-two (left) lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 41-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, based on physical evidence. The subject suffered a medical emergency rendering him unconscious while negotiating the uphill left curve. Without being maneuvered, the vehicle began a gradual left roadside departure where the front right struck down the guardrail end adjoining the bridge overpass. The vehicle continued along the median, parallel to the roadway, until it reached the edge of the overpass, approximately 9 meters above the north/south street below. The vehicle launched, front first, and made a front plane landing approximately 15 meters from its launch. The vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. The vehicle pivoted over its front left, to the left where it overturned three quarter-turns, coming to rest on its right side facing southwest. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury.
