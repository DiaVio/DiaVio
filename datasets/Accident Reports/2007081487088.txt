This single-vehicle crash occurred a couple of hours past noon during daylight hours. The location was on a rural roadway. The roadway was a bituminous and two lanes, with one lane in each direction. The pre-crash roadway was a curve to the left with a -5% downhill grade. The weather was clear and the roadway was dry. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph), with a 32 kmph (20 mph) warning advisory sign for the curve.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Honda Accord sedan driven by a fifty nine (59) year old female, was traveling northbound down a hill with a left curve when V1 departed the roadway via the right shoulder, and impacted the guardrail. V1 then began to rotate counter-clockwise and crossed over the lanes of travel, and departed the roadway via the left shoulder. The front of V1 impacted a large embankment wall, and came to rest facing southbound. The driver of the V1 was injured, and aid transported her to the hospital. The vehicle was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, stated she was approaching a slower moving vehicle, and when she looked in her rearview mirror she noticed a vehicle approaching her from behind at a much higher rate of speed, and rather than being sandwiched between the two vehicles, she decided to pull over onto right shoulder.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: "poor directional control" (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected). Associative factors were: panic/freezing, being uncomfortable with general traffic flow, making a decision to pull onto a shoulder with insufficient clearance, traveling too fast, and the exterior distraction of the vehicle behind her. The police report indicated alcohol was present for this driver. The driver has bi-polar disorder, anxiety, and depression. She takes the following medications: Trazodone, Lamictal, Zoloft and BuSpar.
