This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 81-year old, male driver with deployed airbags, as well as a belted, 80-year old, female passenger with deployed airbags. Both occupants sustained serious injuries. This vehicle was involved in head-on frontal impact with a large sedan. The crash occurred early evening on dry, dark, roadway in clear weather. A 2008 Buick Lucerne sedan (v1) was cresting a hill on a two-way, two-lane, rural, bituminous roadway heading east. There was a 1% uphill grade approaching the hillcrest. A 1994 Mercury Grand Marquis sedan (v2) was traveling west approaching the same hillcrest. V2's approach was also on a 1% uphill grade. As v1 approached the hillcrest, it traveled left across the center lines. V1 impacted v2 head-on. After impact, v1 subsequently rotated counter clockwise 70 degrees, coming to rest in a field facing north on the south roadside. V2 came to rest in the roadway just after impact. V1 and v2 were both towed due to damage. V1 was driven by an 81-year old male case occupant and occupied by an 80-year old female right front passenger case occupant. Both occupants were restrained by lap and shoulder belts with actuated retractor pretensioners. The steering wheel airbag and right top instrument panel airbags both deployed. The available seat back and curtain airbags did not deploy. Both occupants were transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance where they were diagnosed with serious injuries.
