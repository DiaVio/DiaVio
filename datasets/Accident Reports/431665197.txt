This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 36 year old male seated in the front left seating position (Driver) of a 2006 Infinity F45 SUV with deployed driver frontal and side curtain air bags who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred off the southbound roadedge of a 4- lane divided highway within the confines of an interchange. There are three (asphalt) level southbound lanes (that curve to the left) and one on/off- ramp lane. The posted speed limit was 50 mph (80 km/h). At the time of the crash it was daylight and cloudy with no adverse weather conditions although the roadway was wet due to previous rain storm. The case vehicle (V1), a 2006 four-door Infinity F45, was being driven southbound in the inboard travel lane when the driver lost control of his vehicle (possibly due to a medical episode) and traveled off the south travel lanes (including the on/off ramp) and impacted the front right bumper (sideswipe damage) with a metal guardrail. The driver tried to gain control of the vehicle by braking and steering to the left but V1 traveled back onto the roadway, yawing across the southbound travel lanes before impacting its front bumper with a concrete barrier. After impacting the concrete barrier, V1 rotated counter clockwise 280 degrees as it traveled to its final resting position in the left inboard travel lane facing south. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by a 36 year old unrestrained male case occupant who was seated in the front left seating position. The available frontal (IP) and side curtain air bags deployed in the crash while the side seat back mounted air bag did not. This case occupant's seat track was positioned at rear most and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of his injuries.
