A single vehicle crash happened at dawn in the eastbound direction of travel. The location was on service road adjacent to a freeway just after an exit ramp from the freeway. The service road was an uphill roadway from the freeway that became a level roadway. The weather was cloudy and the roads were wet and slick from a light rain. The service roads was comprised of worn concrete travel lanes.

Vehicle one (V1) was a 1990 Chevrolet Astro Cargo Van driven by a 21 year-old male with one passenger. After exiting the freeway and entering the number two lane of the one-way service road, the vehicle lost control on the wet roadway. It started to rotate counter clockwise and departed the road to its left. The vehicle continued to rotate counter clockwise moving down an embankment. The right side wheels got caught in the soft ground. It caused the vehicle to roll over its right side. After 4 quarter turns, the vehicle came to rest on its wheels facing west. According to a witness, both occupants where ejected from the vehicle. The vehicle was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver, a 20-year-old male, and the right front occupant, a 23-year-old male, were transported to a local medical facility. They were unavailable for an interview, so very little information is available of what occurred prior to the crash. The front tires on the van had low tread depth and the rear tires had lower inflation than the front, so this may have been a contributing factor. There was no cargo in the vehicle other than a bench seat and a large truck tire. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason was coded as a driver related factor: type of driver error unknown.
