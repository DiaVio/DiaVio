This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a three-way intersection. The east/west roadway was undivided with one lane in each direction. The intersection also included a single lane one-way northbound roadway. Curbside parking was permitted on each side of all of the roadways. Stop signs controlled all directions. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight, and there were no adverse weather conditions. There was a 5 percent downhill grade for both V1 (eastbound) and V2, westbound. There was a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph) for all directions. The crash occurred on a weekend during the late-afternoon daylight hours. The traffic flow was normal for this roadway and there were no noticeable defects.

Vehicle one, a 1996 Ford Explorer compact utility vehicle, was traveling eastbound and entered the intersection where its front contacted the left front side of vehicle two, a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta 4-door sedan. V2 had been traveling westbound intending to travel straight through the intersection. After the initial impact, V1 rotated slightly clockwise where it came to final rest facing east. After the initial impact, V2 rotated clockwise, coming to final rest facing northwest. The damages to V1 were moderate and it was towed partially as a result of the damages and because the driver of V1 was unlicensed. V2 damages were moderate; the impact bent the left front wheel axle and the wheel frame restricted the tire from rotating. It was eventually towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The driver of V1, a 22-year old male, was partially interviewed on scene with the help of a bilingual bystander. The driver appeared drowsy, a bit incoherent, and often used his vehicle to keep his balance. The interview was choppy; however, with the aid of the bystander and a subsequent visit to the driver's home, a complete interview was obtained. The interpreter on scene reported the driver's first statement as "I didn't see the stop sign. I should have stayed home. The car in front of me didn't stop so I didn't either." The driver stated that he was traveling eastbound about 25 mph and while approaching the intersection continued with his left turn. He said he "didn't see V2 until the two vehicles smashed into each other." During the follow-up interview, the driver admitted to drinking while he was driving. (At the scene, an empty beer bottle was found on the front passengers seat.) He was not injured. He was issued a citation for careless driving and was arrested.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was: "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was inadequate surveillance. Associated factors coded to the driver include: failure to stop at a traffic control device, drinking while driving, failure to notice the stop sign, and unfamiliarity with the roadway.

The driver of V2, a 45-year old female, reported that she had left a furniture store ten minutes ago on her way home and was traveling westbound about 25 mph. She claimed that she stopped at the corner before entering the intersection. When questioned about the presence of skid marks leading up to and on the white vehicle stop line, she said that she didn't remember slamming on her brakes. She said she saw the other vehicle (V2) approaching the intersection without stopping and when it reached somewhere around the middle of the intersection it start to turn left, with no turn signals. She reported that she tried to avoid the collision by steering right and applying her brakes but it was too late. She said the driver of V2 looked like he was looking somewhere else and pointed out after the crash that he looked drunk. She was not injured, but her 23-year old female passenger was transported to the hospital with minor injuries.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was: "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction - over left lane line." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. Associated factors coded to the driver of V2 include the use of prescription medication to control high blood pressure and conversation with her passenger. The skid marks suggested that the driver intended to cross through intersection without stopping at the stop sign.
