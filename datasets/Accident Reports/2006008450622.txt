This crash occurred on a weekday on a rural 4 lane roadway. Atmospheric conditions at the time were cloudy with rain. The speed limit was 56 KMPH (35 MPH). The roadway had a downhill grade of 8.2% and a curve to the right.

Vehicle 1 was a 2005 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe driven by a 24 year old male. There was one other occupant in the passenger seat, a 27 year old male. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of vehicle 1 was negotiating a downhill right hand curve when he lost control and the vehicle began to skid clockwise. The vehicle crossed three lanes of travel and struck the curb with the right front tire and wheel assembly. The vehicle continued its spin over the curb, through a parking lot and into the landscaping where the wheels contacted dirt and caused the vehicle to roll over four-quarters of a turn and come to rest right side up on its tires.

The Critical Pre-crash Event was this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, specifically rain covered roadway. The critical reason for the pre crash event was the driver was going too fast for the curve.
