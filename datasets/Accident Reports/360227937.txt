This frontal impact crash case involves a 23 year old female driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred in an intersection during the early morning hours, in darkness with overhead street lights. The seven lane, two way north-south roadway consists of two northbound, three southbound and two center left turn only lanes for northbound traffic. The north side of the intersection has one center left-turn only lane as well as an additional right turn only lane. The lanes are comprised of asphalt and are straight and level. The intersecting east-west roadway consists of four asphalt travel lanes. At the time of the crash, there were overcast weather conditions and wet roadways. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Volkswagen Rabbit two door hatchback, was traveling south in the center southbound lane and vehicle 2 (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado K1500 four door pickup with an extended cab, was stopped in the outer left turn only lane, intending to make a left turn at the intersection. The driver of V2 began to make a left turn as V1 was crossing through the intersection. The driver of V1 braked but the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's driver frontal air bag. After the impact, V1 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest facing southeast on the west side of the intersection. V2 rotated slightly counterclockwise and came to final rest in the middle of the intersection, facing west. V1 and V2 sustained disabling damage and were towed from the scene. The case occupant is the 23 year old female driver of V1 who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. This case occupant's steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. She was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
