This case involves an 83-year-old driver 162 centimeters (5'4") tall and weighing 72 kilograms (159 pounds). The case occupant was driving a 2015 Honda Fit 4-door hatchback involved in a moderate severity frontal crash with a large bale of hay with a 1/4-turn rollover. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock. The case occupant was properly restrained with a 3-point manual belt and had frontal, torso, and side curtain air bags available to her. Only the frontal and curtain air bags deployed as a result of the crash. On impact, the case occupant moved forward in relationship to the vehicle, loading the seat belt as evidenced by a stretched seat belt and a left shoulder and abdomen contusion. The loading of the seat belt also resulted in a sternal fracture and bilateral rib fractures (right #2-6 and left #2-4) in a certain scenario. Her L2 vertebral body was fractured, possibly due to a combination of loading on her lumbar spine involving vertical loading from the seat and downward loading due to her torso flexing forward over the lap belt. The flexion over the seat belt resulted in a supraspinous ligament injury. She also experienced a brief loss of consciousness and left forehead laceration possibly due to her head being decelerated by the air bag.
