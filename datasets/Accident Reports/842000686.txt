This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 37 year old male driver of a 2000 Cadillac Escalade 4x4 4-door sport utility. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a large diamter tree (event #1). Vehicle 1 was eastbound and proceeding straight on a two lane rural roadway. It was dark (not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 departed the right (south) pavement edge in a forward tracking mode. As Vehicle 1 exited the south pavement edge, the frontal area impacted a large diameter tree resulting in moderate damage (event #1). At this point, the vehicle rotated clockwise and "sustained" contact with the struck object as the right section of the front end structure engaged the tree. Vehicle 1 came to rest in close proximity to point of impact facing southeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital, then transferred to a trauma center where he was hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
