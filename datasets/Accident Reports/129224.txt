Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road and was approaching a T-type intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Peterbilt tractor pulling one trailer was traveling north in the northbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way road. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 reported that his brakes failed and V1 entered the three-leg intersection at the same time as V2, but with the intention of going straight into a commercial parking lot. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. V2 pushed V1 laterally to the north before coming to rest in the northbound lane facing north. V1 came to rest somewhat in front of V2 facing east-southeast. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven from the scene. The 63-year-old male driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. He was transported to a local hospital where he was treated and released with minor injuries (ISS-1). The 36-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag did not deploy. He was transported via helicopter to a regional, level-one trauma center and hospitalized with critical injuries and hospitalized for treatment.
