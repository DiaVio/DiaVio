This case involves a right side crash event (single vehicle crash) resulting in serious injuries to the left and center 2nd row-seated case occupants. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 BMW 325i 4door sedan, was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. The collision occurred at the hill crest where the roadway curves to the left. It was dark, the weather was clear and the bituminous (asphalt) road was dry at the time of crash. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to negotiate the left hand curve at the hill crest but lost control and exited the roadway to the east, entering the grass shoulder. V1 traveled on the grass until the right side plane (right fender) impacted the tree and came to final rest. Upon impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise (less than 30 degrees) but the exact orientation at final rest is unknown. V1 contained six occupants at the time of the crash. V1 was driven by a 14year-old-male (non-case occupant) who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The right front seat was occupied by a 14 year-old-male (non-case occupant) who was restrained by the 3-point manual belt. The left rear seat was occupied by an unbelted 14 year-old female (case occupant #1) who was transported with serious injuries by ground transportation to the nearest trauma center. The center rear seat was occupied by an unbelted 14 year-old female (case occupant #2) who sustained serious injuries and was transported by flight unit to the nearest trauma center. The right rear seat was occupied by two occupants: an unbelted 14 year-old female (non-case occupant) was seated on the lap of an unbelted 14 year-old-male (non-case occupant). The non-case occupants were transported to the hospital by ground transportation. The driver, right front passenger and right rear male passenger sustained minor injuries. The right rear female passenger sustained moderate injuries.
