This case involved a 13 year old male who was a front right passenger using a manual lap/shoulder belt that was involved in a moderate severity rollover crash. He sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. This single vehicle rollover crash occurred during daylight hours with clear, dry conditions in the northbound lane of a rural two lane, two way blacktop road. Prior to the crash this road has a slight up grade, curves slightly to the left, and is bordered by berms on each side with a tree grove on the west side. Vehicle one (V1), a 2010 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan was northbound approaching the curve to the left and lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise. V1 crossed the southbound lane and departed the road on the west side with front tires into the berm with V1 rotated 60 degrees counterclockwise. V1 then began to roll to the right four quarter turns and the undercarriage back impacted the ground. V1 continued to roll five quarters turns and struck a few small trees with minor impacts. V1 then came to final rest on its right side facing west against two small trees that caused minor damage to the top. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is a 13 year old male, who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal instrument panel mounted airbag deployed during the crash. He was transported to the trauma center and sustained severe injuries. The driver of V1 was a 16 year old female who was wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column airbag deployed during the crash. She was transported and released from a local hospital with only minor injuries. No other occupants were in V1.
