Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 47-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2010 Lexus IS 250C 2-door convertible, which was primarily involved in a moderate, front left impact, with the frontal plane of a 2006 Toyota Avalon. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This three-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight), of a summer weekday, at the intersection of an east/west roadway and a north/south trafficway. The east/west roadway is intersected on the south side by the north/south trafficway, forming a "T-type" intersection. The eastern and western legs of the intersection consists of three travel lanes respectively, while the southern leg consists of two southbound travel lanes, separated from the three northbound lanes, by a grassy median. Travel into and through the intersection is controlled by standard, overhead, tri-colored electric signals. The speed limit for the east/west roadway is 35 mph (56 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were dry. The 47-year old female case occupant was operating Vehicle 1, the 2010 Lexus IS 250C 2-door convertible, at the western leg of the intersection, in the eastbound through lane. She intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling east. Due to conflicting evidence (belt loading abrasions at shoulder guide and latch plate vs. pretensioner actuation locking belt in a retracted position), it could not be determined if the driver was utilizing an available 3-point lap/shoulder belt, however, the vehicle was equipped with advanced frontal impact air bags, a driver's knee bolster air bag and front, seatback mounted, side impact air bags. Vehicle 2, a 2006 Toyota Avalon 4-door sedan, was traveling west, at the eastern leg of the intersection, in the left turn. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to turn left at the intersection and continue traveling southbound. Vehicle 3, an unknown motor vehicle, was stopped at the intersection, in the right turn lane, of the northbound roadway (southern leg of the intersection). The driver of Vehicle 3 intended to turn right at the intersection (head east), after eastbound traffic had cleared. Crash: Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the front left plane of Vehicle 1 (event 1). As a result, Vehicle 1 was deflected to the right, traveling across the intersection at the junction of the northbound travel lanes. At this time, Vehicle 1 reportedly struck the left side plane of Vehicle 3 with its frontal plane (event 2 / very minor impact), and came to rest, facing an easterly direction. As a result of the first event, Vehicle 2 rotated counterclockwise an unknown degree before coming to rest in the intersection, in the westbound travel lanes. As a result of the first impact, the driver's frontal and knee bolster air bags deployed for Vehicle 1. Post-Crash: The 47-year old driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center (CIREN center) and hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries, while the driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured. Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash, while Vehicle 3 was driven away from the scene by its uninjured driver.
