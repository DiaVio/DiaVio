Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Chrysler Sebring coupe, was traveling west in lane two of a two lane, one way limited access roadway. V1 was negotiating a curve to the right under dry, dark conditions. V1 began to rotate clockwise, departing the roadway to the left side, where it entered a wide grass median. V1 continued rotating clockwise down an embankment and then up an embankment, where it struck a tree with its left side. This impact rotated V1 180 degrees counterclockwise, where it struck another tree with its right side. V1 came to final rest after the second impact. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 22 year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The right front passenger in V1, the case study occupant, is a 21 year-old male that was also wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The driver and passenger side frontal air bags did not deploy. The right front passenger of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
