This near-sided crash involves a 31-year-old restrained male with deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injury. This crash occurred under dark and rainy conditions. The collision occurred at the intersection of a four lane, two way roadway that travels north-south and a four lane, one way roadway, part of a six lane, two way trafficway divided by a concrete median that travels east-west. The north-south roadway was controled by a stop sign and the east-west roadway was not controled by any traffic device. The case vehicle (V1), a 2008 Saab 9-5, was traveling north in lane two of the roadway and was approaching the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Ford Ranger, was traveling east in lane two of the roadway and was approaching the same intersection. The crash occurred when V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection. This caused the front of V2 to strike the left side of V1. Both vehicles came to final rest on the eastern portion of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 31-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. The available steering wheel mounted frontal air bag deployed as a result of impact as well as the B-pillar mounted pretensioner. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
