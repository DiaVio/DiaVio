This case involves an SUV that struck the back end of a school bus with its front end, underridding the back of the bus. The case occupant is the unrestrained driver of the SUV. The case vehicle, a 2008 Hyundai Veracruz SUV, was in the outside westbound lane of a dry, level, asphalt, divided, four-lane traffic-way. Vehicle two (V2), a 2010 Bluebird School Bus was westbound in the same lane. The school bus had stopped to allow a dog to cross the road ahead of it. The front of the case vehicle struck the back-end of the V2. The case vehicle under-rode V2 and both vehicles came to a rest in the outside westbound lane facing west. It was daylight and clear. The unrestrained 55-year-old male driver had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel mounted frontal-impact air bag. The driver sustained serious injuries, was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
