This two-vehicle crash occurred in a four-way, traffic signal-controlled intersection. On the east and west sides of the intersection, the roadway is undivided and the traffic lanes for each direction consist of a left-turn lane, a through lane, and a right-turn lane. This roadway is straight and level, with a posted speed limit of 48 kmph (30 mph). This crash occurred in the early afternoon with lunchtime traffic congestion.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Ford Explorer with one occupant, was stopped at the intersection, westbound in lane three, the left-turn lane. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Chevrolet Express 3500 utility van with one occupant, was stopped at the intersection, eastbound in lane two. The traffic signal indicated a green light for both directions and V2 proceeded into the intersection. A non-contact vehicle in front of V1 turned left in front of V2 and the driver of V1 proceeded to turn left also. Neither driver took any avoidance action and the right front of V1 impacted the left front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest near the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a twenty-two-year-old female, was driving from work to her sister's house for lunch. She said she started turning right after the non-contact vehicle in front of her turned and looking to her left while making the turn. She was well rested, very comfortable with her vehicle, and drives this route weekly. She is in good health, takes no medications, and is near-sighted. She was wearing her contacts at the time of the crash.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection. The critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g failed to look, looked but did not see). The forward non-contact vehicle partially blocked this driver's view of V2's approach.

The driver of V2, a forty-five-year-old male, was traveling from a job site to a park. He was well rested, drives this route 3 or 4 times weekly, and very comfortable with his vehicle. He takes Atenolol on a regular basis for high blood pressure and is currently receiving CPAP treatment for sleep apnea.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line. The critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle.
