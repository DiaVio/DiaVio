Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Nissan Murano, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the left westbound lane of a five-lane, two way road (two lanes eastbound, dual left turn lane, two lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Chevrolet Astro minivan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of the same road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 relinquished control of the vehicle, possibly due to a pre-existing medical condition, and the vehicle drifted to the left, crossed the center turn lane and entered the left eastbound lane. The driver of V2 noted the impending danger, braked and came to a complete stop when the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an angled, offset frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 52-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. At the time of the crash, the driver was wearing a knee brace on the right knee due to an earlier medical procedure. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
