This crash occurred at an intersection during daylights hours with clear, dry conditions. At this intersection traffic is controlled by stop signs only for the north and south directions. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Buick Century four door sedan, was northbound on two lane, two way road and stopped for the stop sign at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck was eastbound on a two lane, two way highway that has right turn lanes in both directions at this intersection. V1 started from a stop to go straight across the intersection when the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1 in the intersection. V1 rotated clockwise and side slapped the left side of V1 into the right side of V2. This impact forced V1 to the east as it continued to rotate clockwise about 380 degrees. V1 then departed the south side of the roadway into a paved parking lot where the right side of V1 impacted a post and came to final rest facing northeast. V2 post impact veered to the northeast rotating slightly clockwise over the westbound lane and came to final rest partially off the north edge of road facing southeast. Both vehicles were damaged and towed. The case occupant is the front right passenger of V1 who is a 74 year old male.
