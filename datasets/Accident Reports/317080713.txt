This case involves a 26 year old male driver of a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis four door sedan (V1). He was the driver and was restrained by the 3-point lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal steering wheel mounted airbag. There were three other passengers in the vehicle, a female in the front right passenger seat, a 25 year old male in the second seat left position and a female in the second seat right position. The crash occurred on a three lane city street with the center lane used as a turn only lane. V1 was traveling west on the dry asphalt roadway. The roadway was straight with a 3% downhill grade. The driver of V1 lost control and traveled across the center lane and the eastbound lane and onto a sidewalk. V1 skidded into a light pole with its left front quarter panel. V1 rotated counterclockwise around the pole and slid backwards into the eastbound lane for final rest. The driver (case subject) of V1 and the left rear passenger were both transported to a level one trauma center by ground ambulance. The driver was hospitalized due to the severity of his injuries and the rear passenger was treated in the trauma center and released.
