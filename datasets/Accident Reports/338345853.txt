This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted, 41-year old, male driver with a non-deployed airbag. He sustained moderate injuries in a multi-event crash with trees and the ground. The crash occurred mid-morning on a wet roadway in the rain. A 2006 Cadillac CTS sedan (V1) was traveling south after negotiating a right curve. The roadway was rural, bituminous, two-way, two-lane, with a 1% downhill grade. After V1 successfully negotiated the right curve, it departed the right side of the roadway. V1 traveled approximately 14 meters on the shoulder before sideswiping a tree with its left plane (Event 1). V1 continued a short distance before driving over a small, wooden footbridge (Event 2) and then impacting the ground with its undercarriage (Event 3). V1 then continued another five meters before impacting a 35 cm diameter tree with its front plane (Event 4). V1 came to rest at the point of impact with the 2nd tree and was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 41-year-old male driver who was unrestrained. His buckle pretensioner did not actuate and the frontal airbag did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance before being transferred to a trauma center with moderate injuries. The available frontal, side seatback, and curtain airbags did not deploy.
