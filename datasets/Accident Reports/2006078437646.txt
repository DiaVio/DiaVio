This crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two way, four lane divided by a dirt median. There were two westbound lanes and two eastbound lanes. This was a straight, level, dry,bituminous, asphalt roadway with a posted speed limit of 120 KPH (75 MPH). There is a guardrail off both edges of the roadway. The crash occurred in the afternoon on a weekday and the roadway was dry and the weather was clear.

V-1, a 1996 Mercury Grand Marquis 4dr driven by a 41 year-old female with two passengers, was traveling eastbound in the #2 lane when the tread on the left rear tire apparently began to separate. The vehicle then began to rotate counterclockwise and travel across the eastbound #2 lane and off the right (south) side of the roadway where the right rear of the vehicle struck a guardrail. The vehicle then began to rotate clockwise and the right front area apparently struck the guardrail. The vehicle traveled back onto the roadway while rotating clockwise and came to rest in the #1 eastbound lane facing east. The right front tire of the vehicle apparently detached from the vehicle during the impact. The vehicle was removed from the scene to an unknown location and could not be located. The driver told police that the right rear tire separated which caused her to lose control. The tow truck driver said that the right front tire was removed from the vehicle and the right side of the vehicle was damaged. He towed the vehicle to a residence approximately 2 hours from the crash location. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.
