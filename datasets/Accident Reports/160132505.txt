Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Mazda Protege sedan, was traveling west in lane two of a four lane, two-way roadway negotiating a curve to the right. It was daylight and not raining but the roadway was still wet from rain earlier in the day. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck, was traveling east on the same roadway negotiating a curve to the left. For unknown reasons, V2 crossed center line and the front of V2 struck the front of V1. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway and both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant in V1 (Case study occupant) was a 53-year old male who was unbelted but had both frontal airbags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
