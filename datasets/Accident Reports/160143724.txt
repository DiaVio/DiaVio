This frontal crash involves a 36-year-old restrained male with frontal air bag deployment who sustained serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours under clear conditions with an icy roadway. The collision occurred on a four lane, two-way roadway with a slight curve to the left and an uphill grade. The case vehicle (V1), a 2003 Nissan 350 Z, was traveling west in lane one of the roadway. The crash occurred when V1 drove over a patch of ice and partially departed the roadway off the right side where V1's front right then struck a tree that was located about one meter off the roadway. This impact caused V1 to rotate clockwise before coming to final rest in the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 36-year-old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level-one trauma center by helicopter.
