This case involves a moderate left side impact resulting in head and pelvis injuries to the right front case occupant. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Kia Optima 4-door sedan, was travelling north in the right lane of a three-lane two-way roadway (two northbound lanes, one southbound lane) approaching an intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2007 GMC Sierra K1500 pickup was travelling east in the center travel lane of the intersecting three-lane one-way roadway (two eastbound lanes, one left turn lane). At the time of the crash, it was dark, with overhead streetlights. The weather was clear and the bituminous (asphalt) roadway was dry. The posted speed limit for the north-south roadway was 64 km/h (40 mph). The posted speed limit for the eastbound roadway was 89 km/h (55 mph). Stop lights regulate the traffic at the intersection of the two roads. The crash occurred when both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time. The front of V2 impacted the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. V2 pushed V1 out the northeast corner of the intersection, becoming disengaged after entering the grass. V2 came to final rest facing northeast. V1 continued to skid across the grass for several meters while rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise, coming to final rest facing west. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 32 year old female driver (case occupant) was the only occupant of the case vehicle. Her available lap and shoulder belt was cut, indicating it was in use at the time of the crash; however she exhibited no chest or hip superficial injuries to evidence proper use. None of the available frontal, side curtain, or seat-mounted thorax airbags deployed for her seating position. The case occupant was extricated from the vehicle by EMS and transported to a level one trauma center for treatment of her head and pelvis injuries.
