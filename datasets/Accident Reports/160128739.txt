Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan, was traveling east in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. For unknown reasons, V1 drifted into lane two of the roadway. As the driver of V1 steered right, V1 lost control and skidded off the roadway to the right where it struck a tree with its left. V1 was towed due to damage. There were three occupants in vehicle one. The driver is a 53 year-old male wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The right front passenger and case occupant is a 52-year-old female also wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. Both frontal airbags deployed in V1. In the 2nd row right seat of V1 there was a 12-year-old male wearing a lap and shoulder belt. The driver of V1 and the 2nd row right seat passenger were both transported to a hospital for treatment. The right front passenger (and case study occupant) was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
