Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2010 Kia Forte, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road and was approaching a 3-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2010 Ford Escape, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road and approaching the same intersection but from the east. An unidentified, non-contact vehicle (NCV) was stopped in the westbound lane at the mouth of the 3-leg intersection waiting to make a left turn and this vehicle was in front of V2. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy and the asphalt road surface was icy. As V2 approached the intersection, the driver manuevered V2 to the right of the NCV in an attempt to pass through the intersection on the right shoulder. The driver of V2 apparently dropped the right wheels off the paved surface and he steered left in an attempt to regain the road. V2 re-enterd the road in a sharp left turn maneuver and V2 entered the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 could not avoid V2 and the front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in an L-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 54-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag, seat-mounted thorax air bag, and left curtain airbags all deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. She eventually died from complications of her injuries eleven weeks post-crash while in a skilled nursing facility.
