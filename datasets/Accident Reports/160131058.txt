Vehicle one (V1), a 1998 Subaru Forester, was traveling north in lane one of a one lane, one way roadway, part of a four lane, divided trafficway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 1991 Toyota Corolla, was traveling south in lane two of the same roadway negotiating a curve to the right. For unknown reasons, V2 crossed the median into the northbound lanes where the front of V1 struck the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest in the northbound lanes and both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1 (and case study occupant) was a 49-year-old female who was wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt and had her frontal airbag deploy. She was transported to a level-one trauma center with incapacitating injuries. The driver of V2, a 45-year-old male was also transported but died later that day.
