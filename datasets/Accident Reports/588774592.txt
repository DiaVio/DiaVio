Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 27-year old male driver of a 2009 Toyota Matrix 4-door hatchback, which was primarily involved in a frontal impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the post mid-day hours (daylight), of a summer weekday, on a curved, two-lane, bituminous roadway. This east/west roadway is level, but has a left turning curve for the eastbound travel direction, with a speed limit of 25 mph (40 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The overall environment is residential. Vehicle 1, the 2009 Toyota Matrix 4-door hatchback, was being operated by the 27-year male driver (case occupant), in the eastbound travel lane. The driver and sole occupant of Vehicle 1 was not restrained, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags, seat-back mounted side air bags (front, outboard positions) and roof side rail curtains. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to negotiate the left turning curve and continue traveling eastbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway contacting the curb with its right side wheels (events 1 &2) and then its left side wheels (events 3 & 4). Vehicle 1 subsequently struck a tree (38 cm in diameter) with its frontal plane (event 5) before coming to rest at the impacted tree, facing an easterly direction. As a result of the crash, Vehicle 1's driver's frontal air bag deployed as did both side rail curtains. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by air unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to severe injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene due damage sustained in the crash.
