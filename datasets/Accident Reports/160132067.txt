Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Honda Accord sedan, was traveling south in lane one of a three lane, one-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Ford Mustang convertible, was traveling north in lane three of a three lane, one-way roadway approaching the same intersection. V2 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, resulting in the front of V1 contacting the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest in the southwest corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. There were two occupants in V1. The driver was a 49-year-old male and there was also a passenger in the right front seat (case study occupant), a 24-year-old pregnant female. They were both properly wearing their three-point lap and shoulder belts and both had pretensioner and frontal airbag deployment. The passenger in V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
