This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 50 year old female driver of a 1998 Chevrolet Venture minivan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a frontal impact with a 1993 Dodge D350 Club Cab 4x2 pickup truck (Vehicle 2). The case vehicle was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side impact air bags for the front outboard seating positions (non-deployed). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle 2 was northbound and proceeding straight. It should be noted that Vehicle 2 was a Dodge (Ram Chassis Cab) D30 job rated series Diesel Turbo pickup with a GVWR over 10,000 lbs. (4536 kg.) Vehicle 2 was also towing a 22 foot long (6.7 meter) two axle flatbed trailer. It was unknown if there was any cargo present on the trailer. It was dark (not lighted), with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed Vehicle 1 to cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2. As Vehicle 1 entered the northbound lane, the front right area impacted the front right area of Vehicle 2 resulting in severe damage. At impact, Vehicle 1 was re-directed rearward and to the northeast to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest off the east pavement edge facing southwest. Vehicle 2 came to rest in close proximity to the point of impact (in the northbound lane) facing north. The police reported no intra-unit damage between Vehicle 2 and the flatbed trailer following the initial impact. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash (MAIS of 4 and an ISS of 34). Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
