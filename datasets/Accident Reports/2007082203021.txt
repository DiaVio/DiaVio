This two-vehicle nighttime collision occurred at the intersection of two lighted city streets. The north-south road is the dominant roadway with four lanes of two-way travel and a bike lane in each direction. The east-west roadway is two lanes of two-way travel but is only marked with a dividing line at the intersection. The road is paved with bituminous asphalt and was dry at the time of the crash. The speed limit for both roads is 48 kmph (30 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1997 Chrysler Town and Country minivan driven by a sixty one (61) year old male, was heading west. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Honda Odyssey minivan driven by a thirty one (31) year old female was headed north in lane two. V2 entered the intersection as V1 was passing over and the front of V2 struck the right plane near the front corner of V1. V2 was deflected to the northwest corner, while V1 fled the scene to the north. V2 was towed due to disabling damage and V1 was unable to flee for more than a few blocks before the vehicle was totally disabled. The driver of V1 was unable to be contacted for an interview. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: this vehicle traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection. The critical reason for the critical event is coded to V2 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look looked but did not see). V1 occupied the travel lane prior to V2 , which is why the critical reason was assigned as both vehicles traveled in straight paths. The driver of V2 did not see V1 until just before impact.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path. The critical reason for the critical event is not coded to this vehicle. V1 did make an illegal maneuver by failing to stop for the stop sign. Due to lack of interview, additional factors could not be determined.
