The case occupant is a 41-year-old, unrestrained female driver of a 2001 Mercedes-Benz SLK 230 convertible that was involved with a sideswipe collision with another vehicle and then a frontal collision with a concrete traffic barrier. Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Mercedes-Benz SLK 230 convertible, was travelling south in lane three of a five lane, divided expressway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Ford E350 van, was traveling south in lane four of the same roadway. V2 attempted to change lanes to the right and the right front of V2 struck the left rear wheel of V1. This impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and travel across three traffic lanes to the left and then to strike a concrete traffic barrier with its front. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage, V2 was not. The driver and sole occupant of V1 was a 41-year-old female and is the case study occupant. She was not wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal air bags deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
