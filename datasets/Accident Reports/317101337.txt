This case involved a 75 year old restrained female driver of a 2008 Smart ForTwo two door hatchback (V1). The other vehicle in the crash was a 2004 Ford F-150 pickup truck (V2). The front of V1 collided with the right side of V2, then V1 rolled four quarter turns. The driver of V1 was restrained by the manual lap and shoulder belt and had a deployed frontal airbag. The side impact airbag did not deploy. The crash occurred on at night on an unlit dry asphalt roadway. The roadway curved to the left with a 2% uphill grade. The roadway consisted of three eastbound lanes and two westbound lanes seperated by a grass median. The left eastbound lane was a left turn only lane. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was traveling in the center of the three lanes negotiating the left hand curve reportedly traveling at the posted speed limit. V2 was going south on an intersecting two lane roadway with a negative 6% grade. V2 stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded across the westbound lanes into the center crossover. V2 turned left onto the eastbound lanes into the path of V1 and was struck in the right front quarter panel by the front of V1. V1 rotated counterclockwise and began to slide on the asphalt. The right side tires of V1 tripped on the pavement and began a four quarter turn rollover on the roadway. V1 continued off the right side of the road and came to rest on its wheels. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V2 came to rest partially in the center median and was able to be driven from the scene. The driver of V1 was unconscious when she was removed from the vehicle and was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center where she was hospitalized.
