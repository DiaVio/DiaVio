Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Cavalier, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a rural road. The case vehicle was passing through a T-intersection and the north-south road was converging from four lanes (one right turn southbound lane, one through southbound lane, one left turn northbound lane and one through northbound lane) back to two lane (one northbound and one southbound lane). Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Pontiac Grand Am, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane and had not yet reached the area where the road expands into four lanes. It was dark, snowing and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V1, for an unknown reason, relinquished control and V1 drifted to the left, crossed the centerline, and entered into the northbound lane. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 31-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
