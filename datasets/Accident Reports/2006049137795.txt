The crash occurred at the intersection of a three-lane (six overall), east-west roadway divided by a concrete median and a three-lane, one-way, northbound roadway. The intersection was controlled with traffic signals. The east-west roadway was straight, level, concrete with a posted speed of 48 kmph (30 mph). The northbound roadway was right curved, level, concrete with a posted speed of 64 kmph (40 mph). It was afternoon on a weekday and the road was dry and the sky was clear. Traffic flow was moderate.

V1, a 1998 Ford Escort two door with one occupant, was traveling eastbound in lane two. V2, a 2006 Toyota 4-Runner sport utility vehicle with three occupants, was traveling northbound in lane two. V3, a 2006 Pontiac Vibe sport utility vehicle with one occupant, was stopped westbound in lane three. V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck on the right side by the front of V2. Glass debris from the collision struck and damaged the paint on the hood of V3. V1 rotated clockwise and continued on its path of travel. V1 came to rest in the second travel lane east of the intersection facing northwest. V2 continued on its path of travel and the driver directed the vehicle to final rest in the first travel lane north of the intersection. V3 was not contacted by either vehicle and did not move from its pre-crash position. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

A 21-year old female who reported no injuries drove V1, the Ford Escort. She advised that she was on her way to work, but trying to decide where to stop for dinner prior to starting her shift. She advised that she was traveling at between 16-32 kmph (10-20 mph) when she recognized that V2 was not going to stop and that she had entered the intersection without a green light. She accelerated in an attempt to avoid the collision, but was unsuccessful.

The Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, passing through intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was driver related - inattention.

Another associated factor could be family stress - the driver of V1 reported pressure due to her impending divorce.
