The case vehicle, a 2003 Buick LeSabre sedan, was northbound on a six lane divided roadway, approaching a controlled intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 GMC Yukon SUV was eastbound on the intersecting five lane divided roadway approaching the same intersection. It was daylight, there were no adverse weather conditions and the road was dry. The case vehicle crossed the path of V2 and was struck on the left side. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate clockwise and V2 to rotate counterclockwise. The two vehicles side slapped. The case vehicle departed the roadway at the northeast corner and came to rest straddling the curb facing northeast. V2 came to rest in the northeast corner of the intersection facing northeast.

The case occupant, the 68-year-old restrained female driver and the 46-year-old male right-front passenger were the only occupants. The frontal impact airbags did not deploy during the crash. The case occupant was transported a level-one trauma center directly from the scene.
