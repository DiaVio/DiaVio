The case occupant is a 75 year old female front right passenger involved in a severe frontal, head on crash with a frontal impact air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This two vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours, under clear weather and dry roadway conditions, at a junction of one straight and one curved roadway. Both roadways consist of two asphalt travel lanes, with paved shoulders present on both sides of the lanes. There are painted medians on the south side of the intersection, and for vehicles traveling northbound there is a posted stop sign. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Hyundai Elantra four door sedan, was traveling north in the northbound lane and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2000 Subaru Forester compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in the southbound lane of the intersecting street. As V2 negotiated the curve to the left, V1 traveled across the painted medians, entered the southbound lane, and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, resulting in the actuation of V1's front row seat belt retractor pretensioners and the deployment of V1's frontal air bags. V1 rotated clockwise and traveled a short distance before coming to final rest on the east shoulder, facing northeast. At the point of impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise, traveled east and the front of V2 impacted the guardrail located on the east side of the travel lanes. V2 came to final rest on the east shoulder, facing northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant in V1 is a 75 year old female front right passenger who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her top instrument panel mounted frontal air bag deployed during the crash. The case occupant sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital prior to being transferred to the trauma center, where she was hospitalized for eight days. The driver of V1, a 79 year old male, was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and his steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed during the crash. He was not injured in the crash. The driver and sole occupant in V2 was reportedly not injured.
