The focus of this case is on a 19-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2003 Acura RSX (V1), involved in a single vehicle rollover collision. This single vehicle collision occurred during the evening hours (dark), of an autumn weekday (Wednesday), on a straight level section of a two lane roadway. This bituminous roadway runs east and west. The weather was cloudy and the roadway surface was wet. The speed limit for the east/west roadway is 56 km/h (35 mph). The 19-year old male driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the westbound travel lane. He was wearing the available 3-point lap/shoulder belt. The driver frontal air bag and side thorax air bag did not deploy in this rollover event. For unknown reasons, V1 lost control on the wet pavement and departed the westbound travel lane in a counterclockwise yaw crossing the eastbound travel lane and departing the south edge of the roadway. The rightt wheels of V1 dug in and tripped V1 - beginning a passenger side leading roll as it contacted the mailbox post. V1 continued the roll across the driveway of a private residence. V1 rolled 6 quarter turns across the driveway and grassy slope, coming to rest next to a large tree on its roof and pointed in a southeasterly direction. The driver of V1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle by bystanders and transported, by air rescue, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. V1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
