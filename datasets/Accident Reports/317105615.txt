The crash occurred at dawn on a dry asphalt level two lane roadway. The roadway ran north and south and the posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash though it was cloudy. V1 and V2 were both traveling north with V2 ahead of V1. V2 was going approximately 64 kph (40 mph) when V1 approached from behind traveling at a speed of 120 kph (75 mph). The front of V1 impacted the back of V2 with V1 underriding the dump truck. V1 rotated approximately 30 degrees counterclockwise and came to rest in the roadway. V2 came to rest just forward of impact. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V2 was not disabled and was driven from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by air to a level one trauma center due to injuries sustained in the crash.
