Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Corolla sedan, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two way roadway under rainy, dusk conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1984 Toyota Camry, was traveling west in lane two of a three lane, two way roadway with a grass median and was approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection and the left of V1 contacted the front of V2. V1 came to rest in the median to the west of the intersection and V2 came to rest in lane two west of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 59-year-old female and the case study occupant, was the sole occupant of V1. She was properly wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy. In addition, her belt pretensioner fired and her seat-mounted side impact thorax bag deployed. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment. The driver of V2, a 34 year-old male was a fatal at the scene.
