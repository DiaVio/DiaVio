This case focuses on an unrestrained 84 year old female driver in a 2011 Toyota Camry (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, dual first row side airbags, and a driver's knee bolster airbag. The driver's frontal steering mounted and knee bolster mounted airbags deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during the daylight hours on a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane, roadway. The posted speed limit was 72 kph (45 mph). There were no adverse weather conditions. V1 was traveling north in the northbound lane approaching slowing traffic. Traffic ahead of V1 came to a sudden stop. The driver of V1 steered right onto the roadside and braked in an attempt to avoid contacting the vehicle ahead. V1 departed onto the right roadside where it contacted a ditch with its front. V1 then continued a short distance and contacted a mailbox. V1 came to rest in the ditch facing north. The driver was transported to a level one trauma center and treated for serious injuries that she sustained in the crash.
