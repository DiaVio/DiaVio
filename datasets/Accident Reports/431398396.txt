This frontal crash case involves a 76 year old restrained male seated in the front left seating position (Driver) with a deployed curtain air bag who sustained moderate injuries. The crash occurred in the early evening hours (daylight) in dry and clear weather within the confines of an intersection (driveway access related). There are four bituminous westbound travel lanes (two straight lanes and two turn lanes) and four eastbound bituminous travel lanes (three straight lanes and one turn lane). The East and West travel lanes are intersected by two shopping center driveway entrances. This intersection is controlled by a traffic light in all directions and at the point of impact the East/West roadway sags. The posted speed limit for the East/West roadway is 35 mph (56 kmph). The case vehicle (V1), a 2010 five-door Cadillac SRX was being driven westbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 five-door Toyota Prius, was being driven eastbound and vehicle three (V3), a 2000 Nissan Sentra, was being driven westbound. Vehicle #1 was traveling westbound in the right straight lane and Vehicle #2 was traveling eastbound in the left turn lane, attempting to execute a left turn in order to enter a shopping center. The crash occurred when V2 entered the intersection and impacted its right side with the front of V1. After initial impact, V1 continued in a northwest direction impacting the rear of V2, which was traveling westbound in the right turn lane, before traveling to its final resting position partially off the curb in the northwest portion of the driveway entrance. After initial impact V2 rotated counter clockwise 90 degrees before traveling to its final resting position in the right straight lane facing northwest. V3 traveled to its final resting position (next to V1) partially off the curb in the northwest portion of the driveway entrance. V1, V2 and V3 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 76 year old male case occupant who was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (retractor and buckle type pretensioner actuated). The available steering wheel mounted air bag and the seat back mounted air bag did not deploy in the crash. The driver's curtain air bag did deploy as a result of the crash. This case occupant's seat track was positioned at full back and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. There was no seat deformation for the driver's seating position. The case occupant was moderately injured and transported to a level 1 trauma center by ground ambulance for treatment of his injuries.
