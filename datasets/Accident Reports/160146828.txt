The crash occurred on a two-lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2005 Jeep Liberty SUV being driven eastbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, departed the roadway to the right. V1 then went down a hill and struck a tree head-on. V1 came to final rest off the roadway to the right and was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 48-year-old female case study occupant who was restrained by the available three-point manual belt. The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and transported to a level-one trauma center by helicopter.
