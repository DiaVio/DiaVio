Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Honda S2000 convertible, was traveling east on a two lane, two-way roadway negotiating a curve to the right under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Buick Rainer utility vehicle, was traveling west on the same roadway. While negotiating the curve, V1's right tires went off the south side of the roadway. V1 steered to the right to correct and this sent V1 into a counterclockwise yaw. V1 then crossed the centerline of the roadway and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1. This event caused the right side of V1 and the right side of V2 to impact in a sideslap type impact. Both vehicles came to rest in the roadway and both were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1 (case study occupant), a 21-year-old male, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. The frontal airbags did not deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
