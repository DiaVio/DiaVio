Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier, was southbound in lane one. A tractor-trailer was in front of V1 and a non-contact vehicle (NCV) was in lane two to the left of V1. V1 passed the NCV and then changed lanes to the left. Another NCV was in front of V1 in lane two. V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway. The driver of V1 abruptly steered to the right and V1 began to rotate clockwise. V1 rolled over to the left six quarter-turns and was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a twenty-one-year-old male, was traveling with a twenty-year-old female passenger. They were on their way from a store to a birthday party for the driver's son. This driver stated that he was watching the first NCV that he had passed and steered left when he realized that the second NCV was in lane two. He further stated that he was not comfortable with his vehicle; he was driving the passenger's mother's vehicle without permission and did not like the way it handled. Also, he stated that he had sinus and tooth infections and was taking three different OTC flu medications.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the left side." The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; overcompensation." This driver's failure to look far enough ahead, his speed, his discomfort with this vehicle, his focus on an extraneous vehicle and his illness and use of flu medications were associated factors in this crash.
