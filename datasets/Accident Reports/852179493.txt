This case occupant is a 63 year old female driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a moderate frontal collision with a secondary rollover event and who sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours, with clear weather and dry roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Avalon four door sedan, was eastbound in lane two of a four lane, two way state highway. The asphalt travel lanes are bordered by paved shoulders and there is a metal guardrail located on the north side of the freeway. V1's precrash roadway was level and undivided but V1 was approaching a section of the highway where the east/west lanes become divided by a guardrail impact attenuator, followed by a jersey barrier. As V1 traveled east, it departed its travel lane to the left. The front left of V1 struck the impact attenuator, resulting in a moderate corner impact. V1's left front tire caught the attenuator, causing V1 to rotate sharply counterclockwise back into lane two. V1 then began to rollover to the right and completed four quarter turns before coming to final rest on its tires, facing northwest while straddling the south shoulder and lane one. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 63 year old female, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. During the rollover, there was evidence that the driver's left hand/arm was partially ejected out the left front glazing area. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
