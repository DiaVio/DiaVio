Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Saturn L200, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a three lane, two-way road (one southbound right turn lane, one southbound left turn lane, and one northbound lane) and was approaching a T-type intersection. It was dark but illuminated with street lights and it was raining and the bituminous road surface was wet. As V1 approached the T-intersection, the driver continued straight and departed the south edge of the intersection. V1 crossed over a sidewalk and the right-front bumper corner of V1 struck a 35-cm diameter tree. V1 rotated ninety degrees counterclockwise and came to rest against the tree facing east. The 29-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries. The 29-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage.
