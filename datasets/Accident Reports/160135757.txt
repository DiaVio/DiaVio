Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo coupe, was traveling north in lane three of a three lane leg of six lane, divided trafficway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Pontiac Firebird, was traveling south in lane three of a six lane, divided trafficway and was approaching the same intersection. V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection and the front of V1 contacted the front of V2. Both vehicles came to final rest in the southwest portion of the intersection and both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, an 80-year-old female and case study occupant, was properly wearing her three-point lap and shoulder belt and had both frontal airbags deploy in the crash. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
