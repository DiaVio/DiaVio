This moderate severity frontal crash involved a 44 year old female driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt with a frontal air bag deployment and who sustained serious injuries. This single vehicle crash occurred at night, in darkness (no street lights available), on a two lane, two way roadway with no shoulders. V1's travel lane was comprised of asphalt, was level, and was dry at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit for this stretch of the roadway was 80kmph (50mph). Vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Toyota Tundra pickup truck was westbound when it drifted to the left, traveled over the eastbound lane and then departed the roadway to the left into a sloped ditch. V1 travelled for some distance in the ditch and then the left side swiped a tree/shrub. V1 continued into a wooded area beyond the ditch and the front of V1 impacted a large tree prior to coming to final rest facing west. V1 was disabled and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and four other occupants were in the vehicle. The case occupant is a 44 year old female driver who was using the manual lap/shoulder belt. On impact the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed in her position. She sustained serious injuries and was taken to a local hospital and then transferred to the trauma center and hospitalized. The four other occupants in the vehicle were: a 12 year old male who was not belted in the front middle seat, a 10 year old male seated in the front right seat and who was using the manual lap/shoulder belt, a 12 year old male in the second row left seat who was not belted, and a 12 year old male in the second row right seat who also was not belted. They all sustained minor injuries.
