This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 79-year-old female belted right front passenger with deployed front and side airbags. This occupant was riding in an intermediate size 5-door hatchback when it was involved in head-on, offset frontal collision to the front of a tractor-trailer. The case vehicle sustained severe damage. This case occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. The crash occurred mid-day in clear conditions on a dry road. A 2015 Nissan Rogue 5-door hatchback (Vehicle 1) was traveling southeast on a three-lane, two-way divided road approaching a four-way signal-controlled intersection. V1 was in the left lane intending to turn left. A 2016 Volvo tractor-trailer (Vehicle 2) was traveling northwest approaching the same intersection and intending to proceed straight. The road was 3% uphill for both approaches. Vehicle 1 began turning left at the intersection. The driver reported being unfamiliar with the area and taking the turn too wide. When he encountered a divider median, he slowed to go around it. The front of V1 then collided with the front of V2 (Event 1). The front of V1 was overridden by V2. Both vehicles came to rest in the road near impact and were towed due to damage. The case vehicle was occupied by a 79-year-old female belted right front passenger. She was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by latch plate loading. The retractor pretensioner actuated. Anchor pretensioner actuation was indeterminate due to the plastic cover. No buckle pretensioners were installed. In addition to the deployed airbags for the driver's position, the right instrument panel, right outboard seatback, and right curtain airbags deployed in the crash. This occupant was transported to a hospital before being transferred to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries. V1 was driven by an 80-year-old male belted driver. He was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt as evidenced by 17 cm of shoulder belt payout and latch plate loading. His retractor pretensioner was actuated and the steering wheel hub, left outboard seatback, and left curtain airbags were deployed. He was transported to a hospital for treatment of police-reported non-incapacitating injuries.
