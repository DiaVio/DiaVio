This crash occurred on a divided urban trafficway. The trafficway is situated in a north to south configuration and is comprised of 2 travel lanes in each direction separated by a raised grass median without a positive barrier. The northbound travel side has a dedicated left turn lane. The area is under construction and the east side of the trafficway is bordered by a paved shoulder and a gravel berm. At the time of the crash it was dark and the street lights were lit. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. At the time of the crash traffic can be moderate to heavy. Involved in the crash was the case vehicle (V1) a 2003 Saturn Vue 4-door sport utility vehicle equipped with manual 3-point lap and shoulder restraint for each seating position. The center rear restraint is integrated in the center rear seat back. In addition to the manual restraints the V1 is also equipped with driver and right passenger frontal impact air bags, both of which deployed in the crash. The driver and lone occupant of the V1 was a 39-year-old female. She was using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. Also involved in the crash was the Principal Other Vehicle (POV) (V2) a 1984 Chevrolet G20 Van. The driver of the case vehicle lost consciousness in the crash, however she was awake upon arrival of the paramedics. She was removed from the case vehicle by the paramedics and transported to the trauma center under a "High Suspicion of Injury" trauma criterion. She was transported via helicopter. V1 was traveling in a northerly direction in the second lane. V1 was traveling to the left of a non-contact vehicle, which was in the first (curb) lane. The POV (V2) was traveling in a westerly direction exiting a driveway. V2 was exiting the driveway in a southerly heading in spite of the center median, which would have prevented the vehicle from going into the southbound travel lanes. As V1 continued north, the driver sped up, passed the non-contact vehicle and then changed lanes to the right to drive north in the first lane. As V1 changed lanes to the right, V2 entered the northbound lanes of traffic. V1 struck V2 in the left front fender area. After the initial impact, V1 started to rotate in a clockwise direction as it continued to travel in a northerly direction. As V1 was rotating clockwise, it departed the trafficway at the east edge and crossed the paved shoulder and gravel berm striking a concrete utility pole with the right side. This right side impact came as V1 was sliding to its final rest position. The V1 came to final rest against the utility pole facing in a northwesterly direction.
