This frontal crash involves a 61-year-old restrained female with deployed air bag who sustained serious injury. This crash occurred during daylight hours under dry, and clear conditions. The crash occurred on a two lane, two-way roadway traveling primarily east-west. The roadway is level and is not divided by any markings. The case vehicle (V1) is a 2003 Toyota Highlander utility vehicle. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, departed the roadway to the left. V1 first stuck a small tree with its left side and then struck a larger tree with its front. After impact with the second tree, V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest partially on, partially off the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 61-year-old female case occupant who was restrained by the available three-point manual belt. Both available frontal air bags deployed during the crash. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
