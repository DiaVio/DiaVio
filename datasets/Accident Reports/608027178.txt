The case vehicle, a two-door 2001 Dodge Stratus was traveling northeast on a two-lane roadway, negotiating a right-sweeping curve with a downgrade that terminates at a three-leg intersection controlled by a stop sign. It was dark, the weather was clear, but the roadway was snowy due to drifted snow. The case vehicle traversed the intersection and departed the intersecting northbound roadway off the east shoulder, crossed a private lawn, struck 26-cm tree with its front end. The case vehicle rotated counterclockwise slightly after impact and came to a rest facing northeast. The 40-year-old female driver was not restrined by a three-point belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The case occupant, the 42-year-old female right-front passenger was restrained by a three-point belt and the top-mounted instrument panel air bag deployed. The 15--year-old female right-rear passenger was not restrained by a three-point belt. The driver sustained police reported 'A' injuries and the right-rear passenger sustained severe injuries. Both were transported to a local hospital. The case occupant sustained severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center.
