This case involved a 27-year-old belted female driver responding to a frontal, offset left, under-ride collision into the back of an SUV. The relatively 'moderate' severity of the 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact caused the subject's frontal impact air bag to deploy as the subject sustained a serious injury. This two-vehicle crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a multi-lane, divided, interstate traveling through an urban area. There were six lanes for northbound travel and an exit lane at the far right. The roadway was straight and level. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the morning (daylight), weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2005 Honda Accord, 2-door coupe) was traveling northbound in the exit lane (far right). V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts (1st row pretensioners), first row frontal impact air bags (advanced) and first row seat back mounted side impact air bags. The 27-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint, based on physical evidence. The opposing vehicle (V2, 2002 Mercury Mountaineer, 4-door utility vehicle) was also traveling northbound in the exit lane. There were heavy, stop and go, traffic conditions as V1 and V2 traveled (up to) a 'moderate' speed. As traffic in the lanes to the left slowed and stopped, a large truck pulled into the exit lane causing the driver of V2 to brake and steer right quickly. The driver of V1 braked and steered right but struck the back of V2 with its front plane (offset left) resulting in a 12 o'clock principal direction of force impact to V1. V1's first row driver's frontal impact air bag deployed. V1 under-rode V2 as it pushed V2 forward. V2 rotated approximately 150-degrees as it slid to a stop on the east paved shoulder facing southwest. V1 continued its forward, slightly right diagonal trajectory and came to rest on the paved shoulder facing northeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing southwest Both vehicles were towed from the scene with V1's disposition due to disabling damage. The case subject (driver V1) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
