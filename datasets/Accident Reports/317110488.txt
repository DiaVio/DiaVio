This case involved the 17 year old restrained male driver and the 18 year old restrained male front right passenger of a 2012 Honda Civic four door sedan (V1). There were two other occupants in the second row, a 14 year old restrained male in the left position and a 17 year old restrained female in the right position. All of the occupants were restrained by the available lap and shoulder safety belts and all frontal and side airbags deployed. The other vehicle involved in the crash was a 2001 Mercedes ML3 compact sport utility vehicle (V2). The crash occurred at the intersection of two city streets. It was dark with both roadways lit by street lights and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The road was concrete and level in the area of impact. The posted speed limit was 48 kph (30 mph). V1 was eastbound in the center lane of three lanes of a one-way street reportedly traveling at the posted speed limit. V2 was northbound in the left of two northbound lanes traveling at a reported speed of 80 kph (50 mph). As V1 entered the intersection, it was struck in the right front door by the front of V2. V1 rotated counterclockwise and traveled off the northeast quadrant of the intersection. V1 sideswiped a metal trash can with its left side then impacted a building with its frontal plane. V1 came to rest at the building. V2 also rotated counterclockwise post impact and slid into a metal pole on the northeast corner with its right side. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. All four occupants of V1 were transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center. The driver, the front right passenger and the 2nd row right passenger were hospitalized due to the severity of their injuries. The 2nd row left passenger was treated and released from the emergency department.
