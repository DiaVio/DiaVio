Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Honda CR-V, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a four-lane, divided freeway (two lanes eastbound, unprotected grasssy median, two lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1985 Mack tractor pulling one trailer was traveling east in the right eastbound lane to the right of V1. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the concrete road surface was dry. As V1 was traveling beside V2, V2 experienced a tire blowout that caused V2 to veer to the left. The left side of V2 contacted the right side of V1. V2 continued to the left, taking V1 along with it, and entered the grassy median. V2 began to jackknife as it crossed the median. Both vehicles departed the median and crossed the westbound lanes before departing the north side of the limited access freeway. V2 departed the north side of the freeway while jackknifing and rolled onto its right side before coming to rest in a swampy area. V1 also departed the north side of the freeway and struck the muddy ditch with its front end before coming to rest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 64-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious injuries.
