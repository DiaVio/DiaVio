This three-vehicle crash occurred in the early afternoon of the weekend near a 4-way signal controlled intersection. The north/south roadway consisted of two lanes in each direction with a third southbound lane that served as a left turn only lane divided by a painted gore. The bituminous roadway was dry and straight, with a slight downhill grade and a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash. A strong sun glare existed as vehicles traveled southwest.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Jeep Wrangler with one occupant, was southbound on the roadway approaching the 4-way intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Nissan Pathfinder with one occupant, was stopped at the intersection, awaiting the light to turn. Vehicle three (V3), an unknown vehicle with an unknown number of occupants, was also stopped at the intersection ahead of V2. V1 failed to stop behind V2 and the front of V1 struck the back of V2. V2 was pushed forward and its left front corner struck the back of V3. All three vehicles came to final rest in the southbound lane two near the points of impact. V1 and V2 were towed due to damage while V3 left the scene prior to police arrival. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.
