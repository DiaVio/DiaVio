This case involves an impact between the front of a passenger car (case vehicle) and a left side of a sport utility vehicle. The unrestrained 90-year-old male driver is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2010 four-door Nissan Sentra, was southbound negotiating a left-sweeping curve on wet, divided, asphalt, three-lane level road approaching a three-leg intersection with an off-ramp. Vehicle two (V2), 2006 Lexus RX400h SUV, was eastbound in the inside lane of the off-ramp approaching the same intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. As V2 was exiting the off ramp it entered the path of the case vehicle, the front of the case vehicle struck the left side of V2. After impact the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise, the right side of the case vehicle side-slapped the left side of V2. The case vehicle then mounted the east curb and came to rest on the roadside. V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest in the outside northbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the unrestrained 90-year-old male driver. He had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel air bag. He was transported to a level-one trauma center with serious injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
