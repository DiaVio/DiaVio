V1, the Dodge Ram van, was driven by a 49-year-old male who was not belted. The driver was transported, treated and released for a minor laceration to his face. The driver stated to the police that he had been talking on his cell phone, misjudged the turn and hit the tree. Surrogate interviewee (driver's ex-wife) stated that she was on the phone with him arguing about family matters when she heard him hit something. The driver wore glasses for an unknown condition. No additional information was obtained from the driver.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an internal distraction, a driver recognition error. This was chosen because the driver was on a cell phone arguing with his ex-wife at the time of the crash. Associated factors coded to this driver were traveling too fast, reason unknown (issued a traffic citation for speeding) and possible aggressive driving due to his anger/frustration with the ongoing argument. Police did not consider either alcohol or illegal drugs to be involved and ordered no tests.
