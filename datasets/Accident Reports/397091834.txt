This crash occurred on a 3-lane one way rural trafficway. The trafficway is situated in a north to south configuration and is comprised of 3 travel lanes. At the time of the crash it was early morning and dark and the street lights were lit. The weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Traffic for that time of the morning is light. Involved in the crash was the case vehicle (V1) a 2000 Kia Sportage equipped with manual 3-point lap and shoulder restraints for each outboard seating position. In addition to the manual restraints, V1 is also equipped with a driver and right passenger frontal impact air bags, both of which deployed in the crash. In addition to the frontal impact air bags, V1 is also equipped with a driver's knee bag, which also deployed in the crash. The driver and lone occupant of V1 was a 49-year-old male. He was not using the available manual restraint at the time of the crash. The driver of V1 lost consciousness in the crash. He was still unconscious when the paramedics arrived. He was removed from the vehicle and transported via helicopter to the trauma center with a "High Suspicion of Injury" criterion. V1 was traveling in a southerly direction in the second lane. V1 departed the trafficway on the right side and drove south across the grass, which borders the west side of the roadway. V1 then struck a concrete utility pole with the right side of the vehicle (Event 1) and continued traveling in a southerly direction. While the right side of V1 was still engaged with the concrete pole, the front edge of the right "A" Pillar struck a diagonal wooden pole (Event 2) used as a support for a vertical wooden light pole (the concrete pole and the diagonal wooden support pole were replaced prior to the scene inspection). The right side of the roof was crushed downwards from this contact as V1 continued forward in a southerly direction. The contact to the right side of the roof and roof rail caused V1 to start to rotate in a clockwise direction as it continued traveling in a southerly direction. As V1 was rotating in a clockwise direction it struck several shrubs (Event 3 ) which were located in the front of a guard shack. The guard shack was not contacted. V1's clockwise rotation was enhanced from the curb impact and it rotated clockwise to its final rest position in the grass facing in an easterly direction.
