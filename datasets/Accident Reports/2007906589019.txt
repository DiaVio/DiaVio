This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection. The intersection included one southbound lane and one northbound lane. Three westbound lanes intersected these lanes. The south/northbound lanes were not physically divided - only double yellow lines separated the two lanes. The westbound lanes consisted of three joined lanes and one single lane separated by wide slightly raised curb/grass median. Signalized traffic control devices controlled the movement through the intersection. The bituminous roadways were dry and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit for the westbound lanes (V1) was 64 kmph (40 mph) and the south/northbound (V2) directions were 56 kmph (35 mph). The crash occurred on a weekend during the early-afternoon daylight hours. The traffic flow was normal for this roadway and it was free of any noticeable defects.

V1, a 1998 BMW 740 series 4-door sedan, was traveling westbound when its front contacted the left rear side of Vehicle two, a 1992 Honda Accord 4-door sedan, traveling southbound through the same intersection. After the initial impact, V1 traveled several feet, rotating clockwise where it came to final rest facing northward. Vehicle two, after the initial impact, rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise, traveling several feet where it came to final rest facing eastward with its left rear tire straddling the northwest curb edge. Both vehicles were towed from the scene from damages sustained. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1 and Unknown for V2.

The driver of V1, a 52-year old male, said he was traveling westbound at approximately 64 kmph (40 mph). As he approached the intersection, he saw that the traffic light was green, so he preceded traveling through it and out of nowhere the other vehicle, V2, came across his path. He said, V2 was traveling southbound going very fast. He travels on this roadway weekly and is pretty familiar with it. He was on his way home from church and had driven about 8 miles before the crash. He was transported from the scene to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. There were no associated factors coded to the driver of this vehicle.

The driver of V2, a female (age unknown), in a partial interview stated she was traveling southbound, not very fast, talking to her passenger/friend when approaching the intersection noticed the traffic light turning yellow, however, thought she could get through it. But, halfway through her vehicle was struck by V1. She seemed hesitant about participating with the interview and after answering a few of the questions she said, 'that's it'. She was issued a citation for driving a vehicle without a valid driver's license. She along with her male passenger was transported from the scene to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
