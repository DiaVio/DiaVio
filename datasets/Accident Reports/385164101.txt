Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 43-year old, female driver (case occupant), of a 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which was primarily involved in a severe, front right impact with a tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the afternoon hours (daylight), of a summer weekday, on a six-lane, north/south roadway. This bituminous roadway consists of three southbound lanes and three northbound lanes and is straight and level. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 45 mph (72 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the roadway surfaces were dry and the weather was clear. The 43-year old female case occupant was operating Vehicle 1, the 2006 Toyota Tacoma pick-up truck, in the southbound travel lanes, approaching an intersection from the north. She was not belted, but the driver's frontal air bag deployed for this crash. Crash: For unknown reasons, Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway (western edge). Vehicle 1 traveled down a small embankment and entered a brush filled wooded area. At this time, Vehicle 1 sideswiped a small tree with its right side plane (event 1) and continued to strike and shear-off a series of small trees (all 10 cm or less in diameter) with its frontal plane (events 2 through 5). Vehicle 1 subsequently struck a larger, bifurcated tree with its front right plane and the front right axle (event 6 / main impact). Vehicle 1 pivoted/rotated clockwise and unknown degree and likely struck another small tree with its left side plane (left rear wheel well area / event 7) before coming to rest in the wooded area, off the west edge of the roadway. As a result of this crash, the driver's advanced frontal air bag deployed. Post-Crash: Based upon self reporting, the case occupant exited the vehicle under her own power (unconfirmed at this time). Responding rescue personnel subsequently transported the case occupant, by land unit, to a local trauma center where she was hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed from the scene as a result of damage sustained in the crash.
