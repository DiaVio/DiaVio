Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 21-year-old male driver of a 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt 2-door coupe, which was primarily involved in a far side impact by the frontal plane of a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the late morning hours (daylight) of a summer weekday, on a straight two-lane roadway. This roadway runs generally north and south and has a slight uphill grade for the northbound travel direction. The speed limit is 50 mph (80 km/h) and at the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The overall environment is rural. Vehicle 1, the 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt 2-door coupe, was being operated by the 21-year-old male driver (case occupant) in the northbound travel lane. The driver and sole occupant of Vehicle 1 was not belted, but the vehicle is noted to be equipped with advanced frontal air bags and roof side rail curtain air bags. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling north. Vehicle 2, a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan, was traveling southbound, approaching the crash area from the north and had just crested a rise in the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: For unknown reasons, as Vehicle 1 traveled north, it departed the right side of the roadway. The driver of Vehicle 1 oversteered left and crossed over the northbound travel lane and entered the southbound travel lane. At this time, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the right side plane of the Vehicle 1 (event 1). Vehicle 1 rotated out of the impact and departed the west side of the road where it struck an embankment with its back left corner (event 2) before coming to rest at the west roadside/roadway edge. Vehicle 2 is believed to have come to rest at or near Vehicle 1, but facing an unknown travel direction. As a result of the first event (event 1), Vehicle 1's driver's frontal impact air bag deployed, as did the right roof side rail curtain. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by land unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to critical injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was reported to be uninjured while the right front passenger of Vehicle 2 was reported to have sustained non-incapacitating injuries and transported to a local hospital. The extent of their injuries and treatment, if any, are unknown. Both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
