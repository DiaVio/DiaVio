This frontal crash case involves a 50-year-old restrained female without air bag deployment who sustained a serious injury. The crash occurred during daylight hours in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a six lane, two-way trafficway divided by a grass median into a three lane, southbound roadway and a three lane, northbound roadway. The case vehicle (V1), a 2006 Ford Expedition utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane three of the southbound roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2008 Nissan Altima sedan, was traveling north in lane three of the northbound roadway. Vehicle three (V3), a 2002 Acura RL sedan, was traveling north in lane two of the northbound roadway. The crash occurred when the driver of V1 sustained a syncope episode and went off the southbound roadway to the left. V1 continued through the grass median and entered the northbound roadway. V1 then struck the mid-left of V2 and then struck the left-rear of V3. All three vehicles came to rest in the northbound roadway and all three were towed due to damage. V1 was being driven by a 55-year male who was restrained by the available three-point manual belt. The right front passenger and case study occupant, a 50-year-old female, was also restrained by the available three-point manual belt. No air bags deployed during impact. The case occupant was seriously injured and was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
