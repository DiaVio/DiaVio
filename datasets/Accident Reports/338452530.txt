This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 69-year-old, female, right front passenger with a deployed airbag. This occupant sustained serious injuries in a frontal impact. The case vehicle was a compact crossover wagon which rear-ended a midsize coupe. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 70-year-old, belted, male driver with a deployed airbag. He was reported as uninjured by police. The crash occurred mid-afternoon in cloudy weather on a dry roadway. A 2007 Hyundai Tucson compact crossover wagon (V1) was traveling south in the middle lane of a three-lane, one-way, urban highway separated from oncoming traffic by a Jersey wall. The grade for V1 was 7% downhill. A 2003 Honda Accord coupe (V2) was traveling in the same direction just ahead of V1. Three other vehicles were stopped in traffic ahead of V1 and V2. These included V3, a 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt sedan, V4, a 2002 Oldsmobile Intrigue sedan, and V5, a 2008 Ford F-350 pickup. V2 did not stop in time and struck the rear of V3 (Event 1). V1 then struck the rear of V2 with its front (Event 2). This impact pushed V3 into V4 (Event 3) and subsequently V4 into V5 (Event 4). All vehicles came to rest a short distance forward of their point of impact. Vehicles 1, 2, 3, and 4 were towed due to damage. V5 continued in service. V1 was occupied by a 69-year-old, female case occupant in the right front passenger seat. She was belted and her retractor pretensioner actuated. Her top instrument panel airbag deployed. The available outboard seatback and curtain airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local trauma center by ground ambulance where she was treated for serious injuries. The case vehicle was also occupied by a 70-year-old, belted, male driver. His steering wheel hub mounted airbag deployed, while the available outboard seatback and curtain airbags did not deploy. He was reported as uninjured by police.
