This single vehicle crash occurred on a divided, six-lane, state highway. There are three lanes in each direction with a concrete barrier dividing the highway. This was a straight, downhill, bituminous roadway with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). It was cloudy and dark but the roadway was illuminated. The crash occurred on a weekend. The road surface had patches of ice with a blanket of snow.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Infiniti J-30 four-door sedan with one occupant, was eastbound in lane three going straight. The vehicle initiated a counterclockwise rotation as it departed the left side of the roadway where the front of V1 struck the barrier. V1 slid along the barrier for 8.8 meters (29 feet)and came to rest on its wheels facing northwest on the shoulder and lane three. V1 was towed from the scene due to moderate damage to the front. The driver was transported to a medical facility due to injuries. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.

A 19 year-old female was driving V1. According to the police report she was traveling 80 kmph (50 mph) on an icy road. Little is known about the drivers pre-crash actions due to the inability to obtain a complete interview, only partial information was obtained. The driver said she lost control of the vehicle due to weather conditions and stated she was traveling at a speed well below the posted speed limit of between 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph). The police also indicated she was traveling below the posted speed limit at 80 kmph (50 mph).

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as an environmental related factor: slick roads (low friction road surface due to ice, loose debris). The driver was traveling too fast for the environmental conditions and failed to maintain directional control of the vehicle.
