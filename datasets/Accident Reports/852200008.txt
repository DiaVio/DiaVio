This near-side impact crash case involves a 66 year old male driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed side impact and side curtain air bag, who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, two way highway during daylight hours, with cloudy weather and wet roadway conditions. The asphalt roadway is straight and level and consists of one north and one southbound lane, with paved shoulders present on both sides. The case vehicle one (V1), a 2008 Ford Explorer four door compact utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane one and Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1990 Ford F150 full size pickup, was also traveling south in lane one, just behind V1. V1 traveled partially onto the right shoulder and then started making a U-turn. V2 traveled into the northbound travel lane to pass and overtake V1 as V1 enter into the same lane. The front of V2 impacted the left side of V1. The force of the impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and the left side of V2 sideswiped the left side of V1. V1 continued rotating counterclockwise into the east paved shoulder and came to final rest partially off the roadway, facing northwest. V2 continued a short distance south and came to final rest in the northbound travel lane, facing south. V1 was towed due to damage and V2 was driven from the scene. The case occupant is the 66 year old male driver of V1 who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. During the first crash event, this case occupant's seat back mounted side air bag and left roof side rail mounted side curtain deployed. Due to the intruding left B-pillar, the left seat back mounted side air bag did not fully inflate. This case occupant sustained serious injuries and had treatment later at an outside hospital before being transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
