This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 38-year-old female belted driver with a deployed frontal airbag. She was driving a full size sedan when it was involved in frontal impacts to two trees. The case vehicle sustained severe damage. The case occupant sustained serious injuries in the crash. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. The crash occurred mid-morning on a dry road under clear skies. A 2009 Pontiac G6 full size sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling east negotiating a left curve on a two-lane rural road. The bituminous road was on a level grade with 10% superelevation in the curve. V1 was initially traveling in the right lane when it departed the right side of the road. V1 traveled through a grass roadside into a residential yard where the front left corner struck a small tree (Event 1). The small tree was uprooted in the impact. V1 continued through the yard where it struck a large tree with its front plane, bringing the vehicle to final rest against the tree. V1 was towed due to damage. The 38-year-old female driver was belted at the time of the crash, as evidenced by the belt being found in the payed out position. The driver's retractor pretensioner was actuated. There were no buckle or anchor pretensioners installed in this vehicle. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed in the first event with the small tree, leaving it partially deflated for the second event with the large tree. The right mid instrument panel, first row outboard seat back, and curtain airbags did not deploy in the crash. No other airbags were installed. This occupant was transported to a trauma center for treatment of serious injuries.
