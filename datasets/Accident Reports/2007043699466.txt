The crash occurred near an interchange in the westbound lanes of a four-lane highway with a grass median secured with a cable guardrail. There were three southbound lanes and one exit lane on the right side of the road. There were breakdown lanes on both sides of the road with rumble strips. The roadway had a posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph) and a downhill grade of 1%. Conditions were daylight and dry with clear skies. The setting was late morning hours on a weekend.

Vehicle one was a 2001 Chrysler Sebring sedan traveling west in lane three. Vehicle two was a 2003 Toyota Camry sedan traveling west in lane two. Vehicle three was a 2003 Ford Expedition sport utility traveling west in lane four. The driver of vehicle one realized he was about to miss his exit and began changing lanes to the right. The right plane of V1 impacted the left plane of V2. V2 rotated counter-clockwise and came to rest in lane one facing east. V1 then crossed over two lanes to the left, traveling in front of the path of V3. The rear plane of V1 was impacted by the front of V3. Both V1 and V3 traveled off the left side of the road into the median. V3 impacted the cable guardrail in the median with its left plane. V1 rotated counter-clockwise one quarter turn and continued sliding through the grass median. The left plane of V1 was impacted by the front of V3. Both vehicles came to rest in the median. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1 and 105 kmph for V2.
