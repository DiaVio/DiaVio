Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. The 15-year-old driver was in training to obtain a driver's license and was being coached by her father, the right-front passenger. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. V1 was traversing a straight section of road when the driver allowed the vehicle to drift to the right. The right side tires of V1 left the paved portion of the road and the deep ditch/downgrade began to pull V1 off the road. The driver attempted to steer left which put V1 into a slight counterclockwise yaw. As the driver of V1 attempted to re-enter the road, the right side of V1 struck a large tree but due to the slope of the ditch, the impact continued along the right side and included direct damage to the right side of the windshield header and right A-pillar. V1 came to rest against the tree and was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 15-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point, seat-integrated seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. She was reportedly not injured. The 52-year-old male right-front passenger was also using the available three-point, seat-integrated seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag did not deploy. He was transported to a regional level-one trauma center with critical (AIS-5) injuries.
