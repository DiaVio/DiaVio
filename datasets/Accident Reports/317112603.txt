This case involved a 22 year old restrained female driver of a 2012 Toyota Camry four door sedan (V1). She was restrained by the available three point lap and shoulder belt and had deployed frontal steering wheel mounted and knee bolster airbags. The left side head curtain airbag also deployed. There were two other vehicles involved in the crash, a 2002 GMC Sierra pickup truck (V2) and a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer four door sport utility vehicle (V3). The crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane asphalt roadway that ran north and south. The road was dry and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). V1 was southbound with a 3% downhill grade and the road curved to the right. V2 and V3 were northbound with an uphill grade and a left hand curve. V1, reportedly traveling at 105 kph (65 mph), crossed the center line into the northbound lane and sideswiped V2 before impacting V3 in an offset frontal collision. V1 rotated approximately 170 degrees counterclockwise and came to rest on the east shoulder of the roadway. V3 rotated counterclockwise and rolled two quarter turns down and embankment on the east side of the road. V2 came to a controlled stop on the east shoulder forward of impact. All three vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of her injuries.
