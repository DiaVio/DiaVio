This case focuses on a restrained 73 year old female right front passenger in a 2015 Honda CR-V (V1). There was also a restrained 75 year old male driver in V1. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. The frontal airbags, right side curtains, and right outboard seatback mounted airbag deployed during the crash. V2, a 1986 Nissan D21 pickup truck, and V3, a 2008 Nissan Xterra were also involved in the crash. The crash occurred on a dry asphalt, two-way, two-lane roadway during the daylight hours. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit for the roadway was (56 kph) 35 mph. V1 was traveling north in lane one while negotiating a left-hand curve. V2 was traveling ahead of V1 while decelerating and heading north in the northbound lane. V3 was traveling south in the southbound lane approaching V2 and V1 while negotiating a right-hand curve. At the last moment the driver of V1 noticed V2 decelerating. The driver of V1 steered left and applied his brakes in an attempt to avoid impact with V2. The front of V1 contacted the rear of V2. V1 then crossed the left lane line and contacted the left rear (quarter panel) of V3 with its left front (fender). After contacting V3, V1 departed the roadway and came to rest facing northwest. After impact with V1, V2 departed the roadway to the right and came to rest after traveling across an intersecting roadway to the right. V2 faced northeast at final rest. V3 came to rest in its original lane facing south. V1 and V2 were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. V3 was neither towed or disabled. The right front passenger of V1 was transported to a level one trauma center where she received treatment for moderate injuries that she sustained in the crash. The driver of V1 was not injured and did not seek medical attention.
