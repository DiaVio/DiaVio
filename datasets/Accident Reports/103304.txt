Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Chevrolet Impala, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a 4-lane, divided, limited access freeway (two lanes northbound, unprotected grassy median, two lanes southbound). It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road was wet. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 drifted onto the right shoulder and when his right tires left the paved surface, the driver steered to the left abruptly. V1 began a counterclockwise rotation as it re-entered the northbound lanes. V1 crossed the northbound lanes and departed the left side of the road into the grassy median. V1 was sliding sideways with the right side leading as it began crossing the median. The right wheels of V1 furrowed into the sod and V1 tripped over its right wheels when it reached the south edge of the median turnaround access road. V1 landed on its right side on the north side of the median turnaround access road and continued to roll five more quarter turns before coming to rest on its roof in the median. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 72-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. The 76-year-old male right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed. Both occupants of V1 were transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
