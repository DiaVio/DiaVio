The two-vehicle crash happened in a signal-controlled four-legged intersection with pedestrian crosswalks. Southbound approach had five lanes, two of them being dedicated left turn lanes. It was straight with a 3.5% uphill profile. Eastbound approach had six lanes, three left turn lanes, two straight lanes and a right turn only lane. This road had a curve right profile with a 2.6% downhill grade. Both roadway were divided by a raised concrete medians and contained curbs and sidewalks. The posted speed limit for all directions was 72 kph (45 mph) and both had bituminous asphalt. Setting was morning hours on a weekday. Conditions were dawn hours, cloudy and dry.

Vehicle 1 (V1) was a 2001 Dodge Ram 3500 Large Van with one occupant traveling southbound in lane two. Vehicle 2 (V2) was a 1999 Ford Mustang, two door, with two occupants traveling eastbound in lane four, the far right left turn lane. VI and V2 entered the intersection at the same time. The front of VI contacted the left side of V2 (event 1). VI claimed to have braked, but there was no evidence on the roadway. After impact, VI steered left while V2 went toward the right. The right side of VI contacted the left side of V2 (event 2). VI left 10 meters (33 feet) of visible right front tire marks before coming to final rest facing east. V2 traveled laterally toward the south leaving 4.8 meters (16 feet) of right front yaw mark before rotating clockwise and coming to final rest facing south, appoximately 12 meters (40 feet) south of first impact. Police Reported Travel Speed is 72 kmph for V1 and 72 kmph for V2.

The driver of VI is a 52 year-old male who was not injuries in the crash. He is self-employed as a package delivery driver who works 45 hours per week, varied based on client's needs. He had just come from his warehouse where he loaded his van with 600lbs of packages. He was en route to a nearby town 100 miles away to deliver the packages. He had driven four miles when the crash occurred. He reported driving straight ahead and looking straight ahead while traveling in the center lane at 64 kph (40 mph). He said he knows he had a green light and denied any internal or external distractions. As he entered the intersection, he noticed V2 pulling out in front of him from the right. He applied the brakes, claiming the ABS engaged, but never felt any pulsating in the pedal. He also thinks he steered left in an attempt to avoid a collision. His vehicle was not towed due to disabling damage.

The Critical Pre crash Event for VI was "Other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was "Not coded to this vehicle." V2 pulled into the path of VI, therefore causing VI to collide into V2. The driver of VI was inattentive to his driving task, but his thought focus is unknown. He also failed to look far enough ahead and see that V2 was proceeding into the intersection. He is far-sighted, but not required by law to wear glasses while driving. The skies were cloudy at the collision.

The driver of V2 is a 20 year-old who was transported from the scene with perceived serious injuries. Him and his brother had just left their house and were on their way to work when the crash occurred. That was the only information available about this driver provided by a third brother who showed up on-scene. A language barrier caused me to be unable to arrange an interview. The police officer on scene said that V2 was stopped at the light before it turned green. The driver had to be extricated from the vehicle. His vehicle was towed from the scene with disabling left side plane damage.

The Critical Pre crash Event for V2 was "This vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was "Unknown." We know this driver entered the intersection, where he was struck by VI. We don't know whether or not he saw VI. The cloudy skies are the only known associated factor for this driver.
