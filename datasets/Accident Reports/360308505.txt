This moderate severity frontal crash involved a 67 year old female driver who was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt, had a frontal airbag deployment and sustained multiple serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylights hours at a T-type intersection under clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Buick LaCrosse four door sedan was traveling eastbound in lane three of a five lane, two way street with a dirt and gravel median present. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Subaru Legacy was stopped northbound in lane two of a three lane, two way street that ended at the intersection. Vehicle three (V3), an International semi truck with a trailer, was stopped in lane one northbound next to V2. Both V2 and V3 proceeded from a stop and began to make left turns that were allowed from both lanes. As V2 and V3 were in the intersection, V1 continued into the intersection. The front left corner of V1 impacted the back left corner of V2, resulting in minor sideswipe damage. Then the full front of V1 impacted V3's left side including V3's tires. V1 rotated to the left and came to final rest facing northbound in the middle of the intersection. V2 moved a short distance from the point of impact with V1 and came to final rest facing northwest. V3 came to rest in the intersection facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. V2 and V3 were driven from the scene. The case occupant is the 67 year old female driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt buckle pretensioner actuated and her frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed. She was taken to an outside hospital with serious injuries and then airlifted to the trauma center. There was a 40 year old female front right passenger in V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt buckle pretensioner actuated and her instrument panel mounted frontal airbag deployed. She sustained only minor injuries and was treated and released.
