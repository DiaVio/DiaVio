Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Volkswagen Jetta, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the second (from right) southbound lane of a 10-lane divided freeway (5 lanes southbound, partially protected grassy median, 5 lanes northbound). It was dark but illuminated, it was raining and the concrete road surface was wet. The driver reported to be traveling at the posted speed of 113 km/h (70 mph) when the vehicle began to hydroplane and he lost control. V1 ran off the left side of the road, into the grassy median and entered a clockwise rotation while attempting to recover control. The left side of V1 struck a guardrail end and V1 continued to rotate clockwise and move in a southerly direction. While V1 was rotating through the guardrail, it apparently struck the damaged guardrail twice with the front plane. V1 came to rest in the grassy median behind the damaged guardrail, facing east-southeast. The 30-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt, the seat backrest-mounted torso air bag deployed, and the left side curtain air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with severe injuries. The 24-year-old female right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt, the seat backrest-mounted torso air bag deployed, and the right side curtain air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital where she was treated and released with minor injuries (MAIS-1, ISS-1).
