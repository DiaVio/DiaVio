This case focuses on a 38 year old unrestrained right front male passenger in a 2011 Chrysler 200 sedan (V1). V1 was also occupied by an unrestrained female driver. V1 was equipped with dual side curtains, dual frontal and dual side airbags. The front airbags were the only airbags to deploy during the crash. The crash occurred on a dark, dry, two-way, two-lane asphalt road. There were no adverse weathers conditions. The posted speed limit for the road was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was traveling east in the eastbound lane when the driver noticed a deer in V1's travel lane. The driver attempted to avoid the collision by braking (with lock-up) and steering right. V1 contacted the deer with its front. After the initial impact with the deer, V1 continued and made additional contact to the deer with its right side. After contacting the deer V1 partially departed its travel lane onto the right roadside. The driver steered hard left in an attempt to maneuver her vehicle back onto the road. V1 crossed the center lane line and continued across the opposing lane onto the left roadside. While on the roadside V1 contacted a ditch with its undercarriage. After contacting the ditch V1, continued and contacted a tree with its front. This impact caused the vehicle to rebound and contact the ditch with its rear. V1 came to rest on the roadside facing northeast. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 did not sustain injury. The front right passenger was transported to local hospital by ground; however, he was later transferred to a level one trauma center where he received treatment for serious injuries that he sustained in the crash.
