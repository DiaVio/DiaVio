This case involves a near-side impact, resulting in severe injuries to the 44-year-old female driver of the case vehicle (case occupant). She was restrained by a three-point belt. No side-impact air bag was available. The case vehicle (V1) a 2004 Land Rover Discovery SUV was southbound in the outside lane of a wet, level, six-lane divided highway negotiating a right-hand curve. It was raining and dark, but lighted. As the driver attempted to merge into the center southbound lane to avoid slower traffic, she lost control of the vehicle and crossed into the inside southbound lane. The driver over-corrected by steering right and the case vehicle began to rotate clockwise, back across the southbound lanes. As the vehicle was skidding laterally, the left side of the case vehicle contacted the left rear corner of a squad vehicle parked in the west distress lane. The impact caused the parked vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest facing south-southeast. The case vehicle rotated clockwise and came to rest facing north. The 44-year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. She was restrained by a three-point manual belt and no side-impact air bag was available. She was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
