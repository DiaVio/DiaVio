Vehicle one (V1), a 2006 Nissan Maxima, was traveling north in lane four on a four lane leg of an seven lane, divided roadway under dry, daylight conditions. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Honda Pilot SUV, was traveling north in the same lane in front of V1. V2 was applying to brakes to decelerate for a traffic light and the front of V1 contacted the rear of V2. This impact pushed both vehicles into the intersection, where they came to final rest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 56-year-old male, was properly wearing the available lap and shoulder belt. The frontal, steering wheel mounted airbag deployed during impact. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
