This minor frontal crash involves a 87 year old female driver who was wearing a lap/shoulder belt and the buckle pretensioner actuated and the front steering column airbag deployed. She sustained moderate severity injuries and was transported and hospitalized at the trauma center. This crash occurred during daylight hours with clear dry conditions on a two way, four lane street. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Hyundai Sonata four door sedan, was southbound in lane 2 slowing to make a left turn into a business driveway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1990 Triumph motorcycle, was northbound in lane two when V1 began the left turn across its path. The front of V1 struck the front of V2. V1 stopped at the point of impact facing southeast in the northbound lane 2, and V2 slid to the northeast from the point of impact and came to final rest against the curb. The motorcycle driver was ejected off the motorcycle and landed near the final rest of V2. Both vehicles were towed. The case occupant, a 87 year old female, is the driver of V1 who was wearing a lap/shoulder belt and the combined retractor and buckle pretensioners actuated and the front steering column airbag deployed. She sustained moderate severity injuries and was transported and hospitalized at the trauma center.
