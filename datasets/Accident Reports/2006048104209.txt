The intersection was controlled with a traffic signal (with left turn arrows) that has pedestrian signals and crosswalks. The posted speed limit is 72 kmph (45 mph). It was dark at the time of the crash and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions present at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1994 Dodge Stealth driven by a 23 year-old female was traveling eastbound in lane one attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and travel north. Vehicle two (V 2) a 2000 Nissan Maxima driven by a 21 year-old male with one passenger was traveling westbound in lane three. As V1 entered the intersection the front of V2 struck the right side.
