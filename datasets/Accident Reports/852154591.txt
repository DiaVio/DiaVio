This crash occurred during the evening hours in darkness with no street lights available. It was raining and the asphalt travel lanes were wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Audi A4 four door sedan was northbound on a two lane, two way undivided roadway that curved to the right with a downgrade. There are no curbs or shoulders on either side of the roadway, and adjacent to the travel lanes are sloped embankments. The driver of V1 fell asleep, crossed the southbound travel lane and departed the roadway to the left down the rocky embankment. V1 traveled down the embankment and the front of V1 impacted the rocky level ground resulting in the deployment of the steering wheel mounted front air bag and actuation of the driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner. V1 then began to rotate slightly counterclockwise, causing V1's to roll over to the right nine quarter turns before coming to final rest on its right side, facing west. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 24 year old female, was the sole occupant and was restrained with the manual lap/shoulder belt. Her steering wheel mounted front air bag and seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center.
