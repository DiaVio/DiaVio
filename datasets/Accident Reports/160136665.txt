Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Toyota Sienna minivan, was traveling west in lane three of a five lane, two way roadway under dry, daylight conditions and was approaching an intersection. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2002 Toyota RAV-4 utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane three of a four lane, one-way leg of a six lane, two-way roadway approaching the same intersection. As both vehicles passed through the intersection, the front of V2 contacted the right side of V1. This impact caused V1 to roll over one quarter-turn to the left, where it came to rest on its left side in the southwest corner of the intersection. V2 also came to rest in the southwest corner of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. Vehicle one contained four occupants. The driver, a 30-year-old male, was properly wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt. The right front seat passenger and case study occupant, a 29-year-old female, was wearing the available lap and shoulder belt and had her seat-mounted side impact thorax air bag deploy. A three-year-old female was sitting in the second row left seat and was restrained by the lap and shoulder belt that was routed through a booster seat. A 7-year-old male was seated in the right second row seat and was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt. The case study occupant and the seven-year-old male were both transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
