Case Focus: The case occupant, a 25 year old, female, was the restrained driver of a 1999 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan, which was involved in a two vehicle collision. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two vehicle collision occurred during the late morning hours (daylight) of a summer weekend on a north/south trafficway. The crash occurred within the area of an interchange, but the interchange itself was not a factor. The trafficway consists of three northbound lanes and three southbound lanes separated by a grass covered median (no positive barrier). The southbound roadway did not play a part in the crash. The roadway surface was bituminous and free of defects. Prior to the area of the crash, the roadway is relatively straight and level, but curves slightly left to right at the crash area. Just beyond the crash area, the roadway becomes four lanes with the addition of a merge/transition lane. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The posted speed limit for this roadway is 89 km/h (55 mph). Vehicle 1 (case vehicle), a 1999 Toyota Camry LE 4-door sedan, was being driven by the 25 year old female case occupant. She was restrained by the available 3-point, manual lap and shoulder belt. There were no other occupants in the vehicle. Vehicle 1 was traveling in the far left (northbound) travel lane. Vehicle 2 was traveling just ahead of Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling north. Vehicle 1 is noted to have been equipped with driver and passenger frontal impact air bags, as well as retractor-type pretensioners. Vehicle 2, a 1997 Mercury Nautica mini-van, was being driven by a 49 year old female of unknown height and weight. As reported by the police accident report (PAR), this occupant was allegedly wearing the available, manual lap and shoulder belt (unconfirmed). There were no other occupants present. The driver of Vehicle 2 was traveling northbound, just ahead of Vehicle 1, in the far left (northbound) lane. It is believed that the driver of Vehicle 2 intended to continue traveling north. Vehicle 2 is noted to have been equipped with frontal impact air bags. Crash: For unknown reasons, the driver of Vehicle 2 decelerated (slowed) in her travel lane. It is believed that the driver of Vehicle 1 braked prior to impact (based upon vehicle damage and injury), but the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 struck and under rode the back plane of Vehicle 2. As a result of this contact, Vehicle 2 was re-directed across the three northbound travel lanes and came to rest, facing north, in the northbound lane one, adjacent to the transition/merge lane. After impact, Vehicle 1 departed the roadway to the left and entered the grass median where it came to rest facing a westerly direction. As expected, the frontal impact air bags, for Vehicle 1, deployed as a result of this impact (potential late deployment possible) and the retractor-type pretensioners actuated. Damage to Vehicle 2's fuel tank could be discerned. The back plane of the fuel tank was noticeably deformed, dented and scraped (no seam failure or leakage was detected). This damage corresponded to the left front corner of Vehicle 1 as it under-rode the back plane of Vehicle 2. As expected, Vehicle 2's frontal air bags did not deploy as a result of this crash. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was, amazingly, able to extricate herself from the vehicle (possibly with help from bystanders). Emergency medical services (EMS) personnel responded to the scene, stabilized and transported her, by air, to a local trauma center where she was hospitalized. She was subsequently released on the 4th day post crash (hospitalized for 3 days). The driver of Vehicle 2 was not injured according to the PAR. She was, however, transported, by land, to a local hospital to be checked out. The extent of her injuries and/or treatment, if any, are not known. Both Vehicles 1 and 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
