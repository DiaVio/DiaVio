This crash occurred during daylight hours while it was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Volkswagon Jetta four door sedan, was eastbound in lane two of a four lane, two way street that curved left and had a downgrade. The posted speed limit was 30 mph/48 Kmph . Vehicle two (V2), a 1988 Toyotal Corolla compact station wagon, was travelling straight westbound in lane two prior to the curve. As V1 came around the curve left, it lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise and crossed over the center line into the opposite lanes sliding laterally. The front of V2 impacted directly lateral into the right side of case V1. V2 rotated clockwise and came to final rest facing northwest across lanes one and two. V2 continued off the roadway on the left, struck a small bush, and came to rest facing northeast across the sidewalk. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 23 year old female, who was wearing her manually lap/shoulder belt without the prentensioners firing. No other occupants were in V1 and the right side roof rail curtain and front right seatback airbags deployed on the right side. The case occupant was injured and transported to the trauma center.
