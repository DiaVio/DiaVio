This case involved a 32 year old male laying across the second row seats of a 2008 Chevrolet Impala four door sedan (V1). There were two other occupants of V1, the 68 year old female driver and a 71 year old male front right passenger. Both front seat occupants were restrained by the available three-point lap and shoulder belts, but the second seat occupant was not restrained. The vehicle was equipped with frontal airbags and left and right front and rear head curtain airbags, but none were deployed in the crash. The other vehicle involved was a 2005 BMW M3 two door coupe (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours on a multi-lane asphalt highway at the intersection of a four-lane roadway. The roadway was straight and had a 2% downhill grade for V1 and an uphill grade for V2. There were no adverse weather conditions at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was northbound traveling approximately 24 kph (15 mph) attempting to turn left onto the intersecting roadway. V2 was going south at 72 kph (45 mph) in the right travel lane. As V1 made its turn from the left of two turn lanes, it was struck in the right rear door by the front of V2. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 90 degrees to final rest in the eastbound lanes of the intersecting roadway. V2 continued forward and came to rest in the southwest quadrant of the intersection. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The rear seat occupant of V1 (case subject) was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital and subsequently transferred to a level one trauma center due to the serious nature of his injuries. The driver and front right passenger of V1 were not injured.
