This frontal crash involves a 24 year old restrained male seated in the front left (Driver) seating position with a deployed steering wheel and roof side rail air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred during the early morning hours (dark) in dry and clear weather. The collision occurred on a level two lane bituminous roadway. Prior to the crash scene the roadway curves to the left and crests. There is one northbound travel lane and one southbound travel lane. There are no traffic control devices for each direction. The case vehicle (V1), a 2009 four-door Toyota Corolla, was being driven northbound at the time of the crash. The crash occurred as V1 was traveling northbound and the driver for unknown reasons lost control and traveled off the north road edge impacting a tree with its front bumper. After initial impact, V1 rotated counter clockwise 90 degrees impacting its right side with a tree before traveling to its final resting position (off the roadway) facing west. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 24 year old male case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt. The retractor type pretensioner actuated (load limiter permitted 29 cm of spool out) as a result of the crash. The available steering wheel air bag and the side curtain air bag deployed as a result of the impact. The seat back mounted air bag did not deploy. This case occupant's seat was positioned between the middle and rear position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was injured in the crash and transported by ground ambulance to a level 1 trauma center for treatment of his injuries.
