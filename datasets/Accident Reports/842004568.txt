This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 40 year old female driver of a 2004 Nissan Altima 2.5S 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal airbags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2004 Toyota Sienna LE minivan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two-lane residential roadway and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle 2 was southbound on the same roadway and negotiating a right curve. The driver allowed Vehicle 2 to cross the centerline, into the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the northbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. At this point, both vehicles rotated counterclockwise and came to rest (in the roadway) in close proximity to the point of impact. Vehicle 1 came to rest facing northwest, as Vehicle 2 came to rest facing southeast. The restrained 40 year old female driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
