The case vehicle, a 2001 Chevrolet Tracker two-door convertible, was westbound on five lane roadway and had just passed through a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions. Vehicle two (V2) a 1999 Kenworth tractor with an empty dump-bottom trailer was traveling westbound in the same lane as the case vehicle, but was moving at a slower speed. The driver of the case vehicle fell asleep at the wheel and the case vehicle struck V2 in the back end. The case vehicle came to a rest after impact. The driver of V2, upon feeling the impact applied the brakes and came to a rest somewhat beyond the point of impact.

The case occupant is the restrained 57-year-old male driver. His steering-wheel airbag deployed as a result of the impact with V2. He was the sole occupant of the vehicle. He was transported to a local hospital, prior to being transferred to a level-one trauma center.
