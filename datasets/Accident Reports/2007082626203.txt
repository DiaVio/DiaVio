The driver of V1, a nineteen-year-old female, was traveling from her home to her family's home. She was healthy, well rested and familiar with her vehicle. This driver travels on this roadway weekly. She stated that she noticed the left turn signal activated on the non-contact vehicle but she assumed that the driver would wait to change lanes until V1 had passed.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction) - over right lane line. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver related factor: overcompensation. An associated factor was the driver's inexperience and the exterior factor of the non-contact vehicle that encroached into her travel lane.
