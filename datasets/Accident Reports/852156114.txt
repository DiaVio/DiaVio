This 83-year-old female (163cm/83kg, 5'4"/182lbs) was the front right passenger in a 2003 Honda Odyssey van that was involved in a severe frontal impact. This passenger was restrained with a manual lap/shoulder belt and on impact the belt pretentioner actuated and the frontal instrument panel mounted air bag deployed. The direction of force of this frontal impact was calculated at 1 o'clock as this case vehicle was turning left at the intersection. At impact the passenger moved forward and slightly to the right and both knees impacted the glove box with significant intrusion rearward of the instrument panel at her seated position. The left lower leg scuffed near the bottom of the glove box and the right knee cracked it on the right edge leaving skin and fabric transfers. The belt webbing has loading from restraining the chest and lower body. The door panel armrest had a scuff from possible contact from the lower right arm and the rear lower quadrant was found cracked and deformed from possible contact with the right hip. This patient suffered multiple injuries, which resulted in her death. She had multiple bilateral rib fractures with bilateral pneumothoraces and evidence of a flail chest. These injuries were attributed to loading through the seat belt and rated certain. Note that some of the rib fracture displacement may have been exacerbated by CPR. She had several skin contusions consistent with significant loading of the seat belt on chest and lower waist. She also suffered multiple pelvic fractures consistent with AP loading of the pelvis possibly due to the seatbelt. She had an open comminuted fracture of the right femur and a right patella fracture and these were attributed to impact with the glove box which was notably deformed with significant intrusion and rated certain. She had a laceration over the right knee that provides supporting evidence for this contact point.
