The crash occurred shortly before noon during daylight hours involving two passenger cars at an intersection without traffic lights. The speed limit for the roadway is 56 kmph (35 mph). The road is a 3-lane divided (no positive barrier) concrete roadway for both vehicles. There was no designated left turn lane for direction. The road surface was dry and there were no detrimental atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Isuzu Trooper driven by a 18 year-old male was traveling east in the third lane attempting a left turn at an intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1989 Toyota Camry driven by a 54 year-old male was traveling west in lane two, attempting to pass through an intersection. At the intersection, the front of V1 impacted with the front of V2. V1 rotated counter clockwise and came to rest within the westbound lanes, facing west. V2 rotated clockwise and departed the roadway to the right. It came to rest in the northwest corner of the intersection, facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. Both drivers and the R/F occupant of V1 received minor injuries. They all refused to be treated at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning left at an intersection. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver decision error: turned with obstructed view. Proceeded to make left turn & did not recognize V2 was in its path due to non-contact large truck blocking view (sight line) of V 2)". Because the other vehicle blocked his view, the driver proceeded with insufficient clearance. The driver stated his view was blocked by a big pick up truck, stopped in lane 3 of the on coming lanes of traffic. The driver looked at the traffic lights of the next big intersection, about 200 meters to the east. He saw the light was red and no traffic approaching his intersection. The driver should have waited until the truck cleared his view of on-coming traffic but made a decision to turn left, looking into his turning direction.

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line. The critical reason not coded to this vehicle.
