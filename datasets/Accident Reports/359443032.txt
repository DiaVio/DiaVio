This single vehicle rollover crash involves a 55 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with no air bag deployments. The driver sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred on a two lane, one way freeway interchange ramp during daylight hours under rainy weather and wet roadway conditions. In the pre-crash area, the asphalt travel lanes have an uphill grade and curve to the left. This roadway has paved shoulders, with a jersey barrier present on the north side and a jersey barrier followed by a guardrail on the south side of the travel lanes. Adjacent to the guardrail is a steep grassy slope, leading to a more level area of grass, dirt and gravel. Vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Ford Ranger Super cab compact pickup, was traveling east in lane two and was negotiating the curve when the driver lost control of the vehicle. V1 began moving to the left, then the driver overcorrected and traveled across lane one and onto the south shoulder. The front of V1 impacted the guardrail, resulting in minor damage. V1 climbed up and over the guardrail and began to rollover to the right. V1 completed six quarter turns as it rolled down the slope, resulting in severe passenger compartment damage. V1 came to final rest on its top, facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 55 year old male, who was restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. There were no air bag deployments. The driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
