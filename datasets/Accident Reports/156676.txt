Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Expedition, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Ford Freestyle van was traveling south in the southbound lane of the same road and was approaching V1. It was daylight, snowing with blowing snow and the bituminous road surface was snow covered. The driver of V2 lost control of his vehicle and it began to enter a counter-clockwise rotation. As V2 rotated counter-clockwise it also crossed the centerline and into the northbound lane. The driver of V1 braked and steered to the right but the front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in an oblique, L-type impact. The impact caused V2 to rotate rapidly in a counter-clockwise manner while V1 was redirected with a slight clockwise rotation and the rear of V2 struck the left side of V1 during the rotations. V1 came to rest off the right side of the road facing east-northeast. V2 came to rest in the southbound lane facing west-southwest. Both vehicle were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 25-year-old female driver of V1 was pregnant (22 weeks gestation) and was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
