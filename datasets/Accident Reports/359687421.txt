This moderate severity frontal crash involved a 66 year old female driver who was wearing the lap/shoulder belt with frontal airbag deployments. She sustained serious injuries and was transported and hospitalized at a trauma center. This crash occurred during daylight hours while it was raining and the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Chevrolet HHR four door hatchback was eastbound in lane one of a five lane, two way street with a center left turn lane. The street was bordered by curbs with paved sidewalks. V1 was negotiating a curve left in the street and had an uphill grade. Vehicle two (V2), a 1999 Volvo S70 four door sedan was travelling westbound in lane two on the same street and was negotiating the curve. V2 lost control in the curve and began to rotate counterclockwise about 90 degrees. It crossed over the center lane, traveled into the eastbound lanes and into V1's path. The front of V1 impacted the right side of V2. V2 then rotated counterclockwise and the right side of V2 contacted the left of V1. The impact forced V1 into the curb and on to the sidewalk, causing minor damage to the right front tire and left lower frame. V1 came to final rest facing east partially on the sidewalk. V2 came to final rest facing east in the westbound lanes. Both vehicles were damaged and towed. The case occupant was the driver of V1. She was a 66 year old female who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and the frontal steering column mounted airbag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital and then transferred to a trauma center. There were two three year old males seated in the second row left and right positions. Both were reportedly secured in child safety seats and were not injured.
