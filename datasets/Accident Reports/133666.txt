Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Ford Mustang, 2-door coupe was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road in a residential area. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road surface was wet. The driver lost control of the vehicle on the wet surface and V1 began a counter-clockwise yaw. V1 continued yawing counter-clockwise as it crossed the centerline, eastbound lane and departed the left side of the road. V1 struck a 30-cm diameter triple-trunk tree with the right-rear quarter panel. The impact caused V1 to cease it's counter-clockwise rotation and begin a clockwise rotation around the tree. While rotating clockwise around the tree the right front bumper struck a small shrub. V1 rotated clockwise approximately 80 degrees around the tree and came to rest off the road facing south. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 28-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was the only occupant and was not using the available three-point seat belt. No air bags deployed during the crash sequence. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
