This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 18 year old male driver of a 2011 BMW 335is, 2-door coupe. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags, (seat back mounted) side air bags for the driver/front right passenger positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions. The case vehicle sustained severe frontal damage as a result of an angled impact with a 2004 Toyota Sienna Minivan (Vehicle #2). The driverâ€™s frontal, torso & curtain air bags deployed as a result of the crash. The crash occurred in the northbound lanes of a four legged intersection. The asphalt surfaced north/south trafficway consisted of 8 travel lanes (two straight, one left turn and one right turn) in each direction divided by a grassy median. There are channelizer posts separating the north and south left turn lanes. These were installed to restrict crossover traffic from the east and west legs. The west/east legs consisted of two travel lanes (one in each direction) separated by a double yellow line. There are channelizer posts located on the east/west entranceway allowing only merging traffic to enter (not cross traffic) the north and south trafficway. The posted speed limit for north/south traffic was 45 mph (72km/h) and there is a -3% grade for the northbound traffic direction. The posted speed limit for east/west traffic was 25 mph (40 km/h) and the intersection was controlled by a stop sign. It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were level and dry. Vehicle 1 was traveling northbound in the outboard travel lane. V2 was in the southbound travel lane attempting to execute a left turn (to travel east) when the front of V1 impacted the right fender of V2 (event #1). After initial impact the left door area of V1 impacted the right rear of V2 (event #2, sideslap). V1 then travel off the north road edge, rotating 180 degrees before traveling to its final resting position partially on the sidewalk facing southwest. V2 began rotating counter clockwise and traveled partially off the north roadedge rolling over, two quarter turns, before traveling to its final resting position on its roof (event #3) in the northbound outboard travel lane facing southeast. Following the collision, the restrained driver of Vehicle 1 was transported by ambulance from the scene to a nearby trauma center and admitted for treatment of his injuries. There were three other occupants in V1 at the time of the crash. There was a 19 year old unrestrained male seated in the front right seating position of V1. He was transported to an unknown hospital for treatment of his injures. There was a restrained 19 year old male seated in the 2nd row left position and an unrestrained 16 year old male seated in the 2nd row right seating position. Both occupants were transported by ambulance from the scene to a nearby trauma center and were later released. Vehicle #1 and Vehicle #2 were both towed from the crash site.
