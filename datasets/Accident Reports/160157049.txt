The focus of this case is on a 52-year old, male driver (case occupant), of a 2005 Mini Cooper (V1), involved in a side impact crash with a 2007 Ford Econoline Van (V2) followed by a secondary impact on the right rear of V1 by a 2007 Hyundai Entourage (V3). This multiple vehicle collision occurred during the early morning hours (dark), of an autumn weekday (Friday), at a four way intersection. The two bituminous roadways for this intersection run north/south and east/west. The weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. The speed limit for both roadways is 72 km/h (45 mph). The 52-year old male driver (case occupant) was operating V1 in the southbound travel lane. He was wearing his 3-point lap/shoulder belt and had the benefit of an advanced frontal impact air bag. V2 entered the intersection traveling eastbound on the east/west roadway, crossing in front of V1. The front of V1 contacted the left rear side plane of V2. After the initial impact, V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to final rest in the center of the intersection pointed in a northeasterly direction. After the initial impact with V2, V1 was displaced rearward and rotated counterclockwise, coming to rest in it's original travel lane pointed in a southeasterly direction.. V3 braked, with lockup, but was unable to avoid V1 and impacted the right rear side of V1. V3 came to rest pointed in a southerly direction behind V1 in the southbound travel lane of the intersection. The driver of Vehicle 1 (case occupant) was removed from the vehicle and transported, by air rescue, to a trauma center and hospitalized with serious injuries. All other occupants, the driver V2, and the driver of V3 were transported to a local medical facility. The extent of their injuries and/or treatments is unknown. All three vehicles were towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
