This 19 year-old male case occupant was the restrained driver of a 2007 Toyota Scion tC that was involved in a "moderate" frontal collision into a concrete barrier leading to a two quarter-turn rollover. The subject's frontal impact air bag and the knee bolster mounted frontal impact air bag both deployed. This single vehicle crash occurred in the southbound lanes of an eight-lane, divided, interstate traveling through an urban area. There were four lanes for southbound travel. The trafficway had a slight uphill grade and was straight at the crash site. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the afternoon, weekday crash. The case vehicle (2007 Toyota Scion tC, 2-door coupe) was traveling southbound in the number-three lane intending to continue straight in that lane. The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, first row frontal impact air bags and a driver side, lower instrument panel mounted air bag. The 19-year-old male driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. As the case vehicle traveled in the number-three lane, a non-contact vehicle passed by it in the number-four lane (to its right) and changed lanes into the number-three lane directly in front of the case vehicle. The case vehicle steered left in an effort to avoid striking the non-contact vehicle. The non-contact vehicle continued changing lanes to the left, from the number-four to the number-one lane in one motion and left the scene. The subject was not able to recover the vehicle from his evasive steering maneuver and the vehicle traveled off of the left (east) side of the roadway, into the paved median and struck the concrete divider barrier with its front left corner. The vehicle's driver side frontal impact air bags deployed. The vehicle sustained crush as it rode up onto the median barrier resulting in the vehicle rotating counterclockwise where its right rear wheel is likely to have tripped the vehicle to the right. The vehicle's damage demonstrates that it overturned onto its right side, slid rearwards for a distance and then continued on over onto it top where it continued sliding for a distance. The vehicle came to rest on its top facing southwest. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject (driver/sole occupant) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
