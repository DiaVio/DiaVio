This case involved a 31 year old unrestrained male driver of a 2006 BMW 650i two door coupe (V1). The driver, and only occupant of V1, was not utilizing the available three point manual safety belt. Several airbags were deployed in the crash, the steering wheel mounted and knee bolster airbags in the front and the door mounted and roof side rail mounted side airbags on the left side. The roof side rail head curtain airbag on the right side was also deployed. The crash occurred during daylight hours on an asphalt interstate highway which was dry with no adverse weather conditions. There were three northbound and three southbound travel lanes divided by a concrete barrier. The posted speed limit was 97 kph (60 mph). V1 was southbound in the right of the three lanes traveling at a reported speed of 137 kph (85 mph). The roadway curved to the left and had a positive 2% grade. The driver of V1 experienced a medical deficiency and was rendered unconscious prior to the crash. V1 struck a bridge rail of an overpass with its right side, swiping all the way down the side of the vehicle. V1 then crossed over all three travel lanes and struck the concrete divider barrier with its front left corner. V1 came to rest across the center lane of traffic facing primarily west and was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to injuries sustained in the crash.
