This case involved the 37 year old unrestrained female driver of a 2010 Hyundai Accent four door sedan (V1). V1 collided with two other vehicles, a 2005 Chevrolet Silverado four door extended cab pickup (V2) and a 2009 Ford F-350 four door crew cab pickup truck (V3).The driver of V1 was not wearing the available lap and shoulder belts, but had a deployed frontal airbag. The side impact airbags did not deploy in the crash. The crash occurred at dark on a well lit interstate highway. There were four northbound and four southbound lanes divided by a concrete barrier wall. The concrete roadway was straight and level and was wet from a previous rain. It had stopped raining and was cloudy at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). V1 was reportedly traveling north at 97 kph (60 mph) in the third of the four northbound travel lanes. V2 was also in the third lane decelerating due to stopped traffic ahead. The front right of V1 struck the rear left of V2 in an offset configuration and V1 then continued into the fourth (left) travel lane. V3 had come to a full stop behind other traffic in the fourth lane when the front of V1 struck it in the rear. V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees, traveled off the right side of the roadway and struck a guardrail with its back bumper. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V2 and V3 were driven away. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to serious injuries sustained in the crash.
