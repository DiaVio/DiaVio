Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Land Rover Discovery, 4-door wagon was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of an eight-lane, divided, limited access freeway (four lanes eastbound, protected median, four lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the third eastbound lane (from right) and was overtaking V1 on V1's right side. It was daylight, the weather was clear and the concrete road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V2 began to change lanes to the left and enter into the lane occupied by V1. The left side of V2 sideswiped the right side of V1. The impact caused both drivers to lose control and V2 departed the right side of the road and came rest off the right shoulder of the freeway. V1 also departed the right side of the freeway but attempted to re-enter the road by steering left. This caused V1 to begin a counterclockwise yaw and V1 tripped over its right side wheels and rolled eight quarter-turns about its longitudinal axis. V1 came to rest off the right shoulder, on its wheels, facing north-northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 37-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was preganant and at 21 weeks gestation at the time of the crash. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 37-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries. The 4-year-old female right-rear passenger of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt in conjunction with an unknown type of child safety seat. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with minor (AIS-1) injuries.
