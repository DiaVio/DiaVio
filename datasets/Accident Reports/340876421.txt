This case involves a passenger car, which was struck on its left side by the front of a 4x4 pick-up truck. The case occupant is the driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2013 four-door Subaru Legacy, was northbound in the outside, through-lane of a dry, level, asphalt, four-lane roadway, approaching a controlled intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 4x4 Chevrolet K-1500 extended cab, 4x4 pick-up truck, was eastbound in the outside through-lane of the intersecting trafficway, approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of the case vehicle on the left doors and fender, engaging both the A- and B-pillar. As a consequence, the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise through the intersection and came to rest in the area in front of the westbound left-turn lane facing west. V2 yawed counterclockwise as it continued through the intersection and came to rest in the outside eastbound through-lane. It was dark, but lighted and cloudy. The unrestrained, 26-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She had the benefit of a deployed seatback-mounted and roof side-rail curtain air bags, but the deployment path of the seatback-mounted air bag was impinged. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
