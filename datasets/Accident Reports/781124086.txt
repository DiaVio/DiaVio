This 62-year-old female case occupant was the restrained driver of a 2005 Saturn Ion that was involved in a "moderate" frontal collision (head-on) with a van. The case vehicle's frontal impact air bags deployed. This crash occurred on an east/west, two-lane roadway traveling through a rural residential area in front of a gas station. There was a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. Adjoining from the south was a business driveway. The trafficway was essentially straight with an uphill grade from west to east. The weather was clear and the bituminous roadway dry. The case vehicle (V1, 2005 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan) was traveling eastbound (uphill) intending to travel straight. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, first row frontal impact air bags and roof rail mounted side impact air bags. The 62-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint based on physical evidence. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1994 Dodge Caravan) was traveling westbound (downhill) on its approach to the site. Westbound traffic was moving slowly as V2 approached the business driveway. Apparently, V2 was behind a large truck and could not see the on-coming traffic well. V2 made a left turn toward the driveway, crossing into the path of V1. The front of V1 struck the front of V2. V1's frontal impact air bags deployed. Both vehicles rotated counterclockwise and came to rest within close proximity of the impact with V1 facing northeast and V2 facing southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 (case subject) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury.
