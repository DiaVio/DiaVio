This 51-year -old male case occupant was the driver of a 2001 Acura CL 2-door sedan, hardtop coupe, that was involved in a moderate severity three-quarter rollover collision, in which the vehicle came to rest on its left side. The case occupant utilized the available three-point seatbelt. The available driver frontal air bag and seat mounted thorax air bags did not deploy. As the vehicle starts to roll to the right, the case occupant moved upward and away from the center of gravity. As the case vehicle rolls from the right side onto the roof the left A-pillar intruded into the occupant's compartment the case occupant's head struck the roof and sun roof resulting in the scalp and facial contusions and abrasions. The combination of the cervical and thoracic injuries strongly suggests direct loading to lower cervical spine and upper thoracic spine. It is probable that the case occupant's neck/back were directly loaded by the roof/ground causing the cervical and thoracic spinal fractures and spinal cord transaction. The severe bending of the spine probably caused the fracture of the bilateral upper ribs, pneumothorax, lung contusion and thoracic tear. His abdomen and lower extremities could have been a result of striking the center console as he moved upward onto the roof, causing the liver contusion and abdominal contusion as well as the thigh contusion.
