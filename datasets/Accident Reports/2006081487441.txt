A single-vehicle collision occurred during mid-afternoon on a Saturday. The collision occurred on a two-way, two-lane, rural roadway. The roadway is a bituminous roadway that curves to the right, and straightens out. Traffic volume was moderate; the roadway was wet, as it was raining heavily. The pre-crash roadway is level. The roadway has a posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Mercury Mountaineer, was traveling southbound in lane one. V1 failed to negotiate the curve to the right, and departed the roadway via the left shoulder, and drove up the steep embankment. V1's undercarriage bottomed out on the embankment as V1 traveled along it. The steepness of the embankment caused V1 to fall-over one quarter turn onto its right side, making gouge marks in the ditch prior to returning to the roadway. V1 came to rest on the passenger side facing westbound in the northbound lane. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1 stated he was initially traveling 64 kmph (40 mph) and was being tailed as he drove down the roadway. He indicated that he sped up to 80-89 kmph (50-55 mph) to get the vehicle behind him off of his tail. Then as he was coming around the corner, a vehicle was coming at him from the opposite direction in his lane. He steered left, while braking and ended up off the roadway to the left.

The driver of V1 is a 23 year-old male, who is reportedly in good health with no hearing restrictions. He does wear corrective lenses for a near-sighted condition, with astigmatism, and he was wearing his glasses at the time of the collision. He has a channelized Anxiety disorder, Agrophobia, for which he takes Xanax. Medical records indicate the driver received a positive BAC reading of 0.28 was obtained two hours after the crash. This driver was considered to have been fatigued. It was because of a combination of things: he normally gets 7 hours of sleep per night, and the night before the collision he only slept about 5 hours; he takes Xanax for anxiety disorder; and his BAC was 0.28. He was on his way from a friend's house, to his home to pick up more cigarettes and stated that he was not in a hurry. He is familiar with the road and drives it daily.

The critical pre-crash event for this vehicle was coded as: this vehicle control loss due to- traveling too fast for conditions. Since the presence of an on-coming vehicle in this driver's travel lane could not be verified, the critical reason was coded as driver decision error: too fast for curve/turn.
