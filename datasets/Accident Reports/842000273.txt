Case vehicle, a 2001 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, being driven by a 37 year old female approximately 157 cm (5'2") in height and weighing approximately 108 kg (238 lbs), was traveling south on a four-lane US Highway with a grass median, two lanes each direction, approaching the intersection of a local municipal street. Vehicle #2, a 1997 Nissan Sentra 4-door sedan, was traveling north on the same US Highway. The crash occured at night on a roadway with dry asphalt. The case vehicle made a left-hand turn onto the municipal street encroaching into the lane being occupied by vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle # 2, a 1997 Nissan, driven by a 32 year old and occupied by a 22 year old right front seat passenger, attempted to take evasive action by swerving to the right. The case vehicle continued into the path of vehicle #2 until vehicle #2's front plane collided with the right side of the case vehicle. The case occupant was restrained with the available three point system and the airbag deployed as a result of the crash. The case vehicle rotated approximately 90 degrees counterclockwise before departing the paved road surface at approximately a 45, degree (NE) angle. The second vehicle rotated approximately 20 degrees clockwise from impact as it departed the paved surface and came to rest in the NE quadrant of the intersection. The intersection had functioning traffic lights at the time of the accident. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital for treatment and then transferred to a level one trauma center for continued treatment of her injuries. Her injuries included a small spleen laceration and a tibial plateau fracture with a MAIS of 3 and an ISS of 14. The case vehicle was towed due to damage.
