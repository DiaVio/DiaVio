The crash occurred in the morning of a weekday in the middle of a suburban “T” intersection. The intersection was composed of a 4-lane north/south roadway (a designated left turn lane was present for northbound traffic as it approached the intersection) that was intersected by a three-lane (center left turn lane) east/west roadway and controlled by a properly functioning traffic signal. Just north of the intersection the north/south roadway becomes divided by a striped, painted median. There were two southbound lanes and two northbound lanes divided by a painted median. The roadway had a posted speed of 72 kmph (45 mph). The northbound approach was straight with a 2% downhill grade while southbound approach featured a right curve and a 2% uphill grade. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions.

V1, a 2006 Lexus GX470 SUV with one occupant, was northbound in lane three (the designated left turn lane) approaching the intersection where it intended to turn left. V2, a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo SUV with one occupant was southbound in lane one negotiating the right curve and approaching the intersection where it intended to go straight. V1 failed to yield and proceeded to turn left as V2 entered the intersection. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1. V2 came to rest facing west near the point of impact in the middle of the intersection. After the initial impact, V1 rotated counter-clockwise and departed the roadway off the southwest corner of the intersection. Upon making contact with the curb, V1 rolled right one-quarter turn into a utility pole guy wire. V1 than rolled left one-quarter turn and came to final rest on its wheels facing west impaled on the guy wire support. The rear of V1 was elevated off the ground at final rest. Police Reported Travel Speed is 24 kmph for V1 and 24 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a 73-year-old male, was uninjured in the crash. He refused to be interviewed and take part in this study. The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 24 kmph (15 mph). V1 was towed from the scene.
