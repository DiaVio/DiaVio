Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Honda Civic, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a six lane, divided, limited access freeway (three lanes northbound, protected median, three lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Peterbilt tractor pulling one trailer was also northbound in the right northbound lane and was ahead of V1. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the concrete road surface was dry. Traffic on this road was stop and go due to a previous fatal crash further downstream. The driver of V2 reported that he had been stopped and had just begun to move forward when he felt V1 strike the rear of his trailer. The front of V1 struck and underrode the trailer of V2. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. V2 was not towed and was driven away. The 24-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was pregnant (26 weeks gestation) at the time of the collision. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with critical (AIS-5) injuries.
