This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unbelted 20 year old male driver of a 2011 Nissan Frontier 4x2 pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a large diameter tree stump. The case vehicle was also equipped with side (seatback mounted) air bags for the front outboard seating positions, and curtain air bags for all outboard seating positions (deployed; unknown sequence). Vehicle 1 was eastbound on a two-lane rural roadway, and proceeding straight on a downhill slope. It was dark; with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. As Vehicle 1 entered a left curve, the driver allowed it to continue in a forward tracking mode, onto the right (south) grassy shoulder. Vehicle 1 traversed an open field in a southeasterly direction. The front right area subsequently impacted a large tree stump, which resulted in severe damage. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated clockwise and began its post-impact trajectory to final rest. Vehicle 1 came to rest in the open field (off the south pavement edge of the road), facing west. The 20 year old male driver of the 2011 Nissan Frontier pickup was presumed to be seated in an upright posture, with the seat adjusted to a mid-to-rear track position. Although the driver reported to police and CIREN staff that he was belted, the lack of restraint use was evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system, relative to the extent of contacts to frontal components. It should also be noted that the front belts were found restricted in the stowed position by retractor pretensioner deployment (with heavy tension on the webbing). At impact, the driver initiated a forward trajectory in response to the 12 o'clock impact force and loaded the knee bolster and deployed frontal air bag. Pronounced indentations, scuff marks, and panel fractures were identified on the left knee bolster. The deflated driver frontal air bag membrane was removed by police post-crash, and was unavailable for CIREN inspection. The accelerator pedal was bent to the right, and attributed to possible lower extremity interaction. At this point, the driver loaded through the deployed frontal air bag and deformed the upper/lower portions of the steering wheel rim. Partial compression of the column shear capsules was documented. The radio was smudged and pushed inward, indicative of right upper extremity engagement. Following the crash, the unbelted 20 year old male driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment. The driver was subsequently transferred to a trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
