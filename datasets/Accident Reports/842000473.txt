This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 35 year old male driver of a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado C-1500 extended cab 4x4 pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of a right side impact with a large diameter tree (event #3). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two-lane rural roadway and entering a right curve. Vehicle 1 continued in a forward tracking mode and subsequently departed the left (east) pavement edge. As Vehicle 1 exited the east pavement edge, the front left area (below the bumper) impacted a roadside ditch culvert resulting in minor damage (event #1). This impact initiated a counterclockwise rotation as the vehicle continued in a southeasterly direction across a private driveway. As Vehicle 1 crossed the driveway, the right bed area struck a mailbox (and post) resulting in minor damage (event #2). The vehicle's CCW rotation continued as the right passenger area impacted a cluster of large diameter trees (event #3). This final impact; a "split tree bole" (2 out of 4 trunks struck), resulted in severe damage. Severe damage was also noted to the greenhouse structure from the final impact. Vehicle 1 came to rest in close proximity to the final impact (in a private yard) facing southwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The driver was 185 cm (73 in) in height, and 167 kg (368 lbs) in weight. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
