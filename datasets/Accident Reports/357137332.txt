This case involves an impact to the right side (nearside impact) of a passenger car by the front end of a pick-up truck. The 31-year-old female right-rear passenger is the case occupant. She was not restrained by a three-point belt, but the roof side-rail mounted side curtain air bag deployed. The case vehicle a 2007, four-door Toyota Camry was in the outside eastbound lane of a, divided, four-lane, dry, level, concrete road approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2) a 1982 Chevrolet C10 pick-up truck was traveling north-northwest in the outside through lane of the intersecting six-lane road. It was dark, but lighted and clear. As the case vehicle was passing through the intersection it crossed the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the right-rear door and quarter-panel of the case vehicle. The case vehicle rotated clockwise and came to rest facing north, straddling the east raised median and the inside lane. V2 rotated clockwise into the intersection, rolled one quarter-turn and came to rest in the middle of the intersection facing northeast. The 26-year-old female driver, the 26-year-old female right-front passenger, the 25-year-old female left-rear passenger and the 31-year-old female right-rear passenger were all unrestrained, but the right-front and the right-rear passengers hand the benefit of a deployed curtain air bag. The driver, right-front passenger, and left-rear passenger sustained police reported possible injuries. The 31-year-old female right-rear passenger was transported to level-one trauma center and treated and released. She later was re-admitted with a serious occult injury and enrolled as a case occupant.
