This frontal crash involves a 20 year old restrained female seated in the front left (Driver) seating position with deployed steering wheel, seat back, and roof side rail air bags who sustained serious injuries. Although the seat back mounted air bag deployed it was covered by a seat cover and it is unknown if it offered any protection to our case occupant. The crash occurred in the evening hours (dark) in wet and rainy weather. The collision occurred on a level two lane bituminous roadway that curves to the left. There is one northbound travel lane and one southbound travel lane. Off the edge of the northbound travel lane (grassy area) there is a slight negative slope. There are no traffic control devices for each direction. The case vehicle (V1), a 2007 four-door Honda Civic, was being driven northbound at the time of the crash. The crash occurred as V1 was traveling northbound and began to exit a left curve then the driver for unknown reasons lost control and traveled off the northbound road edge impacting a tree with its left side. After initial impact, V1 rotated counter clockwise impacting its left front with a fence (impact #2). V1 continued rotating counterclockwise impacting it right side with the fence (impact #3) before traveling to its final resting position. V1 was towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. The 20 year old female case occupant was seated in the front left seating position and was restrained by the available 3-point manual safety belt. The buckle type pretensioner actuated as a result of the crash. The available steering wheel, side curtain, and seat back mounted air bags all deployed as a result of the impact. The seat back mounted air bag was restricted by a seat cover and is unknown if it offered any protection. This case occupant's seat was positioned between the middle and rear position and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. After impact the driver's seat back moved to the rearward midrange position. The case occupant was injured in the crash and transported by ground ambulance to a level 1 trauma center for treatment of her injuries.
