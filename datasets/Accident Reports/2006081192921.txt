This two-vehicle crash occurred during early to mid-afternoon daylight hours. The weather was clear and dry and there were no sight line restrictions. The roadway was a three way T-intersection. The east roadway was a five-lane, undivided, two-way, bituminous road with a center left turn lane in addition to bike lanes on each side. The west roadway was a four-lane, divided, two-way, bituminous road with a center painted median the width of one travel lane. Sidewalks and curbs bordered both roadsides of east/west travel. The grade was negative for westbound traffic and eastbound traffic was required to negotiate a right curve approaching the intersection. The posted speed limit for both vehicles was 64 kmph (40 mph).

Vehicle one (V1), a 1986 GMC Safari mini-van, was traveling eastbound in the center left turn only lane approaching the intersection. As the vehicle crossed the west crosswalk the driver crossed the turn lane markings and struck vehicle two head-on. The driver stated he looked, but did not see any vehicles prior to negotiating the left turn. On impact V1 was pushed backwards as it rotated counter-clockwise. V1 came to rest facing north with the left front tire on the crosswalk. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

Vehicle two (V2), a 1983 Chevrolet Malibu station wagon, was traveling westbound in the inside lane (lane two). As V2 traveled through the intersection it was struck in the front end by V1. V2 maintained it same direction and came to rest in the intersection facing west. There was no evidence of pre-impact braking for V2 and the vehicle dynamics indicate the driver did not steer left or right to avoid V1. V2 was towed due to damage.

The driver of V1, a 46 year-old male, was wearing a lap and shoulder belt and was not injured. He was well rested and not taking any medication. He was familiar with the vehicle and the roadway, which he travels daily to and from work. There were two passengers in V1 that received visible injuries.
