This frontal impact crash case involves a 58 year old male driver who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His frontal, side impact and side curtain air bags deployed during the crash and he sustained critical injuries. This crash occurred during the early pre-dawn hours in darkness with overcast weather conditions and dry roadways. Vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Nissan 370Z three door hatchback, was southbound on a five lane, one way, asphalt freeway. In V1's precrash area the lanes have a downhill grade and curve to the right. V1 was negotiating the curve when the driver lost control of the vehicle. V1 traveled out of its lane towards the east shoulder, then departed the roadway and V1's front left impacted a jersey barrier, resulting in minor damage. Then the left rear of V1 impacted the jersey barrier, also resulting in minor damage. V1 was redirected back into the roadway and crossed all five travel lanes before it departed the roadway to the right. Then V1's front impacted another jersey barrier, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal, side and left side curtain air bags. Both front row seat belt retractor pretensioners actuated and the front row right side impact and right curtain air bags also deployed. V1 rotated clockwise and came to final rest in the southbound lanes, facing northeast. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 58 year old male, who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal air bag, seat back outboard mounted side air bag and left roof side rail curtain air bag all deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
