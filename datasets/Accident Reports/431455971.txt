This frontal crash case involves a 52 year old unrestrained female (case occupant) seated in the front left seating position with a deployed steering wheel mounted air bag who sustained serious injuries. The crash occurred in the afternoon hours (Daylight) in snowy weather. The collision occurred on a curved two lane bituminous rural roadway with one northbound lane and one southbound lane. At the point of impact, the roadway is level and curves to the left (for our case vehicle). The North and South travel lanes are separated by a double yellow line and the posted speed limit is 35 mph (56kmph). The case vehicle (V1), a 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan, was being driven northbound. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 four door Chevrolet Suburban, was being driven southbound. The crash occurred when V1, for unknown reasons, lost control on the snow covered roadway as it began to exit a left curve and crossed over the double yellow line, impacting V2 in an offset frontal crash configuration for both vehicles. After initial impact, V1 rotated clockwise before traveling to its final resting position partially off the west road edge facing, northeast. V2 also rotated clockwise before traveling to its final resting position in the south lane facing, southwest. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash. V1 was driven by the 52 year old female case occupant who was not restrained by the available 3-point manual belt (buckle pretensioner actuated in both frontal positions). The available steering wheel mounted air bag deployed as a result of the impact. This case occupant's seat track was positioned at middle and the seat back was in the slightly reclined position. The case occupant was seriously injured and initially transported to a local hospital and then subsequently transferred by ground to a level 1 trauma center.
