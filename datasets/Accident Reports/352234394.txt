Case Focus: The focus of this case is on a 58-year-old, male driver, of a 2005 Subaru Impreza 4-door hatchback, which was involved in a frontal impact with a large tree. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This single-vehicle collision occurred during the early evening hours (daylight), of an early fall weekday, on a north/south roadway. This straight roadway consists of two travel lanes and has a slight downhill grade for the southbound travel direction. The roadway has speed limit of 35 mph (56 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surface was dry. Vehicle 1, the 2005 Subaru Impreza 4-door hatchback, was being operated by the 58-year-old male driver (case occupant) and sole occupant, in the southbound travel lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 was restrained by his respective 3-point lap/shoulder belt and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with redesigned (2nd generation) frontal air bags. The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to continue traveling southbound. Crash: As Vehicle 1 traveled south, it gradually departed the right side of the roadway and subsequently struck a large tree with its frontal plane. Vehicle 1 rebounded off the tree while rotating somewhat counterclockwise before coming to rest, at the west roadside area, facing a southeasterly direction. As a result of the tree impact, Vehicle 1's frontal air bags deployed. Post-Crash: The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported, by air unit, to a regional trauma center and hospitalized with minor to serious injuries. Vehicle 1 was towed due to damage sustained in the crash.
