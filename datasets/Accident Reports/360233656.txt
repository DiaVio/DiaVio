This frontal crash case involves a 42 year old male driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early, pre-dawn hours in darkness with overhead street lights, clear weather conditions and wet roadways. Vehicle one (V1), a 2007 Acura TSX four door sedan, was northbound on a state route consisting of six asphalt travel lanes. The three north and three southbound lanes are divided from one another by a center jersey barrier and there are curbs and sidewalks present on both sides of the roadway. In V1's precrash area the northbound lanes curve to the left with a slight uphill grade. V1 was traveling straight ahead in lane one and entered the curve. The driver fell asleep and V1 departed the roadway to the right. The right side of V1 swiped along a section of shrubs planted between the roadway and sidewalk, resulting in minor damage. V1 continued north and its front right impacted a large tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag, the front right side air bag and right side curtain. V1 rotated clockwise, traveled back into the roadway and came to final rest in the northbound lanes, facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 42 year old male, who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. The front right outboard seat back mounted side air bag and right roof side rail mounted curtain also deployed. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
