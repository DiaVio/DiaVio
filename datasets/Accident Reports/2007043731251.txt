This single-vehicle crash occurred at night of a weekday on a rural two-lane roadway. The bituminous roadway runs north and south with a posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), but there is an advisory sign of 40 kmph (25 mph) at the location of this crash because of a curve in the roadway. The road was dry and weather condition was clear and dark without street lighting.

V1, a 2003 Ford Mustang with two occupants, was northbound negotiating the curve when it departed the right roadside. V1 corrected its path, reentered the roadway and lost control while departing the left roadside. V1 traveled down a ditch and rolled over five times before coming to final rest on its right side facing south. Both occupants were transported to a hospital and the Mustang was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 97 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1 is an 18-year-old male that was not interviewed for this crash but I overheard his grandfather, while on scene, say that the driver left his home and was driving to his girlfriend's house when this crash occurred.

The Critical Precrash Event for this crash was coded this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded too fast for curve. Associated factors coded to this driver include traveling too fast for conditions, (reason unknown), speeding and tire deficiency (left rear tire was bald).
