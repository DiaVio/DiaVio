This two-vehicle crash occurred a couple hours past noon during daylight hours. The location was a busy arterial in a commercial business area, in an intersection controlled by overhead on-color signals. The north south roadway was a bituminous seven-lane with three lanes in each direction, and turn lanes in the center. The east west roadway is a three-lane roadway. The weather was clear and dry and visibility was clear. The posted speed limit was 56 kmph (35 mph).

The crash occurred in the intersection, in lane one. Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Honda Element SUV driven by a forty (40) year old male, was turning from westbound to northbound at the intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1993 Toyota Camry sedan driven by a twenty five (25) year old female , was traveling northbound crossing through the intersection on a green light, and switched lanes in the intersection from lane two to lane one. As V1 entered the intersection, the front of V2 impacted with the left side of V1. V1 drove to a nearby parking lot to clear the roadway. V2 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.

The driver of V2 pre-crash factors are unknown, as she was not interviewed.

The driver of V1 was listening to the radio & running an errand to the hardware store. He looked to his left and saw a bus stopped in the number one northbound lane, but never saw V2 so he initiated his turn.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, turning right at intersection. The critical reason was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: turned with obstructed view. An associative factor was inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see).

The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded: other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, turning into same direction. The critical reason was not coded to this vehicle.
