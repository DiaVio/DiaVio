This case involves multiple frontal impacts with rollover resulting in serious injuries to the female driver (case occupant) of the case vehicle. Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Mazda Tribute, 4dr SUV was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway and vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Honda CRV, 4dr SUV, was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway in front of V1. The collision occurred at the mid section of the roadway with no traffic lights. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions and the bituminous (asphalt) road was level and dry. The posted speed limit on this roadway is 56 km/h (35 mph). The crash occurred when V1 was traveling behind V2 on east bound. The frontal plane of V1 impacted the back end of V2 in an offset manner (location of damage on V1 from event 1 is very minor and is reported based on towyard witness and police report). Upon initial minor impact, V1 continued to travel off the roadway to its right side and impacted a utility pole then rolled to its right side with three quarter turns. V1 rotated counterclockwise rotation as it rolled and came to rest facing west on the bushes. V1 was towed from the scene. V2 's final rest is unknown and was not towed. The sheared utility pole from impact was replaced before the scene was inspected. The 28-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. There were no other occupants in this vehicle. The driver was transported by the ground transportation to the nearest hospital and was later transported to the nearest trauma center with serious injuries. According to the police report, the driver of V2 is a restrained (lap and shoulder belt) 18 yr old female. She was neither transported to the hospital nor injured.
