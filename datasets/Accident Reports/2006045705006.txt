The crash occurred on a secondary arterial road in a rural/residential area. The road ran east/west and had two lanes with one in each direction, was level and had a curve left (south) after a straight portion if westbound. The curve had a radius measured at 321.4m. This was measured at the run off road because the crash occurred before the curves apex. The side slope at the run off road point was measured to be -12.5% on the north side of the road in a grassy/brushy drainage area. The speed limit was 64kph/40mph. The crash occurred at the beginning of rush hour on a weekday in the early evening.

V1 was a 2000 Mazda Millennia that was traveling west on the road when it departed the right (north) side at the beginning of the curve left. As V1 traveled down into the drainage ditch the front, left engaged the ditch and V1 rotated counterclockwise striking an old tree that was rotten with its (V1's) right side breaking the tree. The top of the tree fell and hit V1's top. V1 came to rest perpendicular to the road facing south. V1 was towed from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

V1 was driven by a twenty seven year old female who was belted at the time of the crash. She was transported with non-incapacitating injuries from the scene via EMS although none of the area hospitals have record of treatment. The driver did not respond to repeated attempts at contact so an interview was not acquired.

The critical precrash event for V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason was coded as an unknown driver error. A vehicle related factor of low tire tread was coded due to only 3mm of tread present on V1's front tires. Poor directional control was also attributed to this vehicle.
