This two-vehicle crash occurred in the middle of a four-way intersection. The intersection included six southbound lanes and seven northbound lanes. These lanes were intersected by one westbound lane and one eastbound lane. The east/westbound lanes were not physically divided - only double yellow lines separated the two lanes. The north/southbound lanes were separated by wide slightly raised curb/grass medians. Signalized traffic control devices controlled the movement through the intersection. The bituminous roadways were dry and straight and there were no adverse weather conditions. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph) for all directions. The crash occurred on a weekend during the mid-evening hours. There were overhead streetlights used to illuminate the dark roadways. The traffic flow was normal for this roadway and it was free of any noticeable defects.

V1, a 1992 Acura Integra 4-door sedan, was traveling eastbound when its front contacted the left rear side of Vehicle two, a 2004 Ford Taurus 4-door sedan, which was traveling northbound through the same intersection. After the initial impact, V1 traveled several feet, rotating counterclockwise and came to final rest facing northward. After the initial impact with V1, V2 continued traveling several feet and rotated counterclockwise across the intersection. The right rear tires/wheels and undercarriage struck the raised cement median located on the north side of the intersection. V2 came to final rest straddling the median and facing southward. Both vehicles were towed from the scene from damages sustained. The police however, recorded the crash on a non-reportable accident form. Police Reported Travel Speed is No PAR obtained (created) for V1 and No PAR obtained (created) for V2.

The driver of V1, an 18-year old male, said he was traveling eastbound taking his friend home after hanging out for a couple of hours. They were talking about the people they had met. As they approached the intersection, the driver noticed that his light was green so he proceeded. At that moment, the passenger shouted out that V2 was also entering the intersection, traveling northbound in lane two. The driver was sure that V2 had the red light because there were other vehicles stopped at the corner facing northbound waiting for the light to turn green. He was the only car traveling through from his direction. After both cars came to a stop, the driver of V2 took off running.
