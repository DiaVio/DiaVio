This case involves a passenger car that departed the roadway, obliquely struck a concrete barrier with its front end, entered a counterclockwise rotation, rotated at least 270 degrees and side-swiped a concrete median barrier before it came to rest. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle a 2007, four-door, Toyota Camry was eastbound, negotiating a left-sweeping curve in the center-lane of a dry, level, five-lane concrete roadway of a divided, ten-lane traffic-way. The driver reportedly lost control of the vehicle and the case vehicle crossed over the lane-line on the left, traversed the two outside eastbound lanes, departed the roadway, obliquely struck a concrete median barrier with its front end, entered a counterclockwise rotation, rotated at least 270 degrees, side-swiped a concrete median barrier and came to rest in the distress lane adjacent to the median barrier facing east. It was daylight and cloudy. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the restrained 79-year-old female driver. She had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact, knee-bolster mounted, roof side-rail and seat-back mounted air bags. The driver sustained multiple moderate injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
