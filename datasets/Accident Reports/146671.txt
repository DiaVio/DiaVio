Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way, rural highway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan, minivan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road that T-intersects with the east-west highway. It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road surfaces were wet. V2 attempted to turn left at the intersection and crossed the path of V1. The front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in an L-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The 64-year-old male driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported to a local hospital and was treated and released with no injuries. The 59-year-old female right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported to a local hospital and was treated and released with moderate injuries (AIS-2/ISS-5). The 14-year-old male left-rear passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and was reportedly seated upright but asleep. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
