This 19-year-old male case occupant was the driver of a 1999 Mitsubishi Mirage that was involved in a far-side collision with a 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier. The impact caused the case vehicle to roll onto the hood of vehicle # 2, rolled off onto its left coming to rest. The case occupant did not utilize the available 3-point lap and shoulder belt. The available driver front air bag deployed upon impact. As the case vehicle is struck by vehicle # 2, the unrestrained case occupant moved to the right. His head most likely went outside of the vehicle where it struck the hood of vehicle # 2, causing the subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage and scalp and facial lacerations. As his shoulder struck the sill of the right door, he sustained the shoulder abrasion. Flying glass caused the lacerations to his hand and finger. As he moved to the right his legs struck the knee bolster causing the abrasions.
