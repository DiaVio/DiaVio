This one-vehicle crash occurred in the early evening hours of a weekday on a two-way, two-lane roadway, which was not physically divided. The bituminous roadway was level with a left curve for vehicles traveling east. From a previous rainfall, the roadway was wet, but it was not raining at the time of the crash. The posted speed limit was 64 kmph (40 mph). There were no traffic control devices associated with this particular stretch of roadway.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1995 Nissan Pathfinder, was heading east on the roadway negotiating the left curve. As the vehicle exited the curve, it began to lose control and yaw in a clockwise direction. The vehicle crossed over into the opposite lane before returning to its original travel lane. The momentum of the vehicle caused it to rollover onto the driver's side before leaving the right side of the roadway where it contacted a fence. The vehicle came to final rest off of the eastbound roadway still on the driver's side facing west. The vehicle had to be towed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of V1, a 21 year-old female, was not injured as a result of the crash and did not require any medical attention. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of this vehicle. For this reason, it is uncertain if any fatigue or health related issues contributed to this crash.

The Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was: this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. The Critical Reason was coded as: too fast for curve or turn. One associated factor coded for this vehicle was wet roads
