The focus of this case is on a 16-year old, right front female passenger of a 2008 Mazda 3 4-door sedan, involved in a moderate off-set frontal impact with a large tree. The single vehicle crash occurred during the early evening hours (dark with no street lights) on a curvy two-lane two-way roadway. The bituminous roadway runs north and south with one lane in each direction with a speed limit of 48 km/h (30 mph). At the time of the crash the roadway was wet and it was raining heavily. Vehicle one (V1-case vehicle) was traveling southbound and exiting a sharp right S-type curve when as the driver lost control of the vehicle, traveling into the northbound lane then back across the south travel lane before traveling off the south road edge before impacting a 67 cm tree. After initial impact, V1 rotated clockwise 90 degrees before traveling to its final resting position half in the northbound lane facing west. The 16-year old female right front passenger (case occupant) was not wearing her available lap and shoulder harness, as evidenced by the fact that the pretensioner deployed with the belt in a retracted position. The available front instrument panel-mounted airbag did deploy for her seating position. The case occupant was transported from the scene to a local trauma center where she was admitted for 5 days for treatment of her injuries. Also in the vehicle was also an 18-year old female driver who was wearing her lap and shoulder harness (pretensioner fired) and her steering wheel mounted air bag did deploy. This occupant was transported from the scene to a local hospital and then released a few hours later with minor injuries. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
