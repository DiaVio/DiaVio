This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 79 year old male driver of a 2004 Nissan Quest 4-door minivan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a parked 1997 Dodge Avenger ES 2-door coupe (Vehicle 2). The case vehicle was also equipped with (seat back mounted) side impact air bags for the front seating positions, and side curtain air bags for the rear outboard seating positions. Vehicle 1 was northbound in the outboard lane of a 4-lane divided interstate highway. The driver allowed the vehicle to depart the right (east) road edge onto the paved shoulder. As V1 entered the east shoulder, the front right area impacted the rear left area of a (unoccupied) parked 1997 Dodge Avenger ES 2-door coupe (event #1). Pre-impact braking by the driver allowed V1 to underride the rear bumper structure of the parked Dodge, resulting in moderate damage. Upon impact, the parked Dodge Avenger rotated clockwise and came to rest straddling the east fogline of the northbound lanes facing southeast. V1 departed the east shoulder, and subsequently entered a wooded area. The left rear side surface sideswiped a small diameter tree (event #2), which resulted in minor damage. V1 continued in a northeasterly direction where the front center area struck a small diameter tree (event #3), resulting in additional (overlapping) moderate damage. At this point, the front right area impacted a 45 cm diameter tree (event #4), which resulted in additional moderate (overlapping) frontal damage. V1 came to rest against the final point of impact (off the east shoulder) facing northeast. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
