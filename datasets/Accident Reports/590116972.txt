This case involved the belted, driver of a compact passenger car responding to a near-side (offset forward, oblique) impact with a medium/heavy truck. This crash occurred at a four-way intersection in a commercial area. The north/south trafficway was straight and had a single lane for travel in each direction separated by painted double yellow lines. The intersection was controlled by stop signs at the north and south legs. There was a gradual grade incline from the northbound approach. The intersecting four-lane east/west, street was straight, divided, and level. The crash occurred during daylight hours and the weather was clear and the bituminous roadways were dry . The case vehicle (V1, 2006 Nissan Sentra, 4-door sedan) was traveling northbound on its approach to the intersection. V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The 45-year-old female driver (case subject/sole occupant) was determined to have been using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1994 Ford "Super-Duty" truck) was traveling eastbound in the number-one lane on its approach to the intersection. The driver was the sole occupant of V2. The driver of V1 (subject) began to negotiate a left-turn at the intersection, bringing it into the path of V2. The driver of V2 observed this and applied his brakes leaving locked wheel tire deposits, up to its final rest. However, the front right of V2 struck the left front of V1, forward of the A-pillar. The impact rotated V1 clockwise (approximately 180-degrees) until the back of V1 struck the right side of V2 (side-slap). V1 came to rest on the southeast corner facing southeast. V2 came to rest just east of the intersection within his original lane at his original heading. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The driver/subject of V1 was transported to a trauma facility due to 'severe' injury.
