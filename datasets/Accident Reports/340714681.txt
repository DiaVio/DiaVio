This case involves an oblique impact between the front-end of a minivan and the front of a passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2008 Chrysler Town and Country minivan, was southbound on a four-lane, dry, level, asphalt roadway approaching a four-leg intersection. It was dark, but lighted and clear. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Toyota Corolla was northbound on the same roadway, approaching the same intersection. As the case vehicle was turning left, crossing through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 struck the front-end of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise, through the intersection, before it came to rest in the intersection, straddling the eastbound through-lane, facing east-southeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest east of the intersection, in the outside eastbound lane, facing east. The restrained 61-year-old male driver was the first occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital. He later transferred to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant. The 71-year-old male right-front passenger is the other passenger in the case vehicle. He was reported restrained and also had the benefit of a deployed frontal-impact air bag, frontal-impact air bag. He sustained police reported non-incapacitating injuries and was medically transported from the scene.
