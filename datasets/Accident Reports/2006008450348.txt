This crash occurred in the afternoon of a weekday in the northbound lanes of a four-lane undivided roadway. The roadway consisted of two lanes in each direction with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). The bituminous roadway was dry and level, with a slight left curve. The traffic flow was normal and there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

V1, a 2002 Buick LeSabre sedan with one occupant, was northbound in lane two. V2, a 1997 Ford F150 Super Cab pickup truck with one occupant, was stopped in lane two waiting to turn left into a parking lot ahead of V1. As V1 continued northbound it failed to slow down and struck the back of V2. Upon striking the back end of V2, V1 drove left across the two lanes of opposing traffic, struck the curb and came to rest near a light post on the west road side. V2 was pushed forward and the driver was able to regain control and drove his truck into another parking lot and waited for police. V1 was towed due to damage while V2 was driven from the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1 and 64 kmph for V2.

The driver of V1, a 43 year-old male, suffered no injuries. He was on his way home from work when he heard a noise and believed his left front tire blew out at the same time his tire pressure warning light came on. The driver looked at the dashboard light and when his view returned to the road he realized he was going to strike the rear of V2.

The Critical Precrash Event was coded other motor vehicle in lane, other motor vehicle stopped. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was a driver related internal distraction, the light on the dashboard. This researcher believes the LF tire was low enough to make the light come on but it was still intact. The LF tire was flat upon inspection, however there was a wear ring on the outside of the LF tire that indicates being driven while low on air pressure.

The driver of V2, a 37 year-old male, also reported no injuries. He advised that was waiting for a break in the traffic so he could make a left and enter a parking lot. The driver noticed V1 approaching and didn't think that V1 was going to stop so he let off the brake and steered right. V1 impacted the rear of the truck and pushed it forward the driver then pulled into another parking lot and awaited police arrival.

The Critical Precrash Event was coded other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle. There are no known associated factors, as the driver was not thought to have contributed to this crash.
