This case occupant is a 64 year old male driver, wearing a manual lap/shoulder belt who was involved in a single vehicle moderate rollover crash with no air bag deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during morning hours on a state highway consisting of one north and one southbound lane, with paved shoulders present on both sides. In the driver's precrash area, the southbound lane is comprised of asphalt, has a downhill grade and curves to the left. At the time of the crash, the weather was overcast with wet roadway conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Chevrolet Aveo four door sedan, was traveling south in lane one. As the driver of V1 was negotiating the curve, he lost control of the vehicle. V1 first rotated counterclockwise, then the driver overcorrected, causing V1 to go into a clockwise yaw with the left side leading. V1 began to rollover to the left, completing five quarter turns prior to coming to final rest on the west shoulder, facing southwest. At final rest V1 was laying on its left side, entrapping the driver's left arm. Some passers-by righted the vehicle prior to police and paramedics arrival. V1 was towed due to damage. No air bags deployed during the crash. The driver of V1, a 64 year old male, was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and sustained serious injuries. He was transported to the trauma center, and was hospitalized for seventeen days. There was a 72 year old male front right passenger in V1. He was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and sustained injuries in the crash, but his treatment status is not known.
