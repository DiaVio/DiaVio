This frontal crash case involves a 56 year old male, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the early, pre-dawn hours in darkness under overcast weather conditions and wet roadways. Vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Pontiac G8 four door sedan, was northbound on a two lane, two way asphalt roadway with no curbs or shoulders. In V1's precrash area the northbound lane curves to the left and has a slight uphill grade. V1 was negotiating the left curve when the driver departed the roadway to the left, traveled over a gravel driveway and the front of V1 impacted a large tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal air bag. V1 came to final rest against the tree, facing northwest. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 56 year old male, who was not restrained with the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal impact air bag deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
