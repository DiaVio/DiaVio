This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 7 year old female rear right passenger of a 2006 Ford Focus ZX4 4-door sedan. The child passenger was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt system, used in conjunction with a booster safety seat (make/model unknown). The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 1990 Honda Accord 2-door coupe (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two-lane rural roadway, and proceeding straight. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the same roadway, and negotiating a right curve. It was daylight, with rainy weather conditions as the road was wet. Vehicle 2 exited the right curve and entered the straightaway, as the driver reportedly became distracted by interior activities (external device brought into vehicle). At this point, the driver allowed Vehicle 2 to cross the centerline, into the path of the westbound Ford. As Vehicle 2 entered the westbound travel lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. Both vehicles came to rest on the north shoulder of the road. Vehicle 1 came to rest facing southwest, as Vehicle 2 came to rest facing northeast. Following the crash, the belted 7 year old female rear right passenger, and belted 32 year old male front right passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported to a local hospital for treatment. The front right passenger of Vehicle 1 was treated and released. The rear right child passenger was subsequently transferred to a nearby trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. The driver of Vehicle 1, a 61 year old male, was reported by hospital personnel as uninjured in the collision. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
