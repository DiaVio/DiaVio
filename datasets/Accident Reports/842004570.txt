This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 35 year old male driver of a 2000 Chrysler Grand Voyager SE minivan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions which deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a utility pole (event 3). Vehicle 1 was southbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. Vehicle 1 reached the apex of the curve and continued in a forward tracking mode off the right (west) pavement edge, into a private yard. As Vehicle 1 departed the west pavement edge, the right front wheel/tire and undercarriage impacted a driveway culvert resulting in moderate damage (event 1). The front left area subsequently struck a mailbox, which resulted in minor damage (event 2). At this point, the front right area impacted an adjacent utility pole resulting in moderate damage (event 3). The pole fractured; as contact damage across the hood and roof structure indicated sustained contact with this object in a non-horizontal fashion (event 4) . Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest (alongside the driveway) off the west pavement edge facing east. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and admitted for treatment of serious injuries. The restrained 12 year old male front right passenger, and 9 year old male (second row) rear left passenger sustained police reported non-incapacitating injuries and received no treatment. The restrained 5 year old male (second row) rear right passenger, and 6 year old female (third row) rear left passenger were transported to a local trauma center with police reported non-incapacitating injuries, and were treated/released. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
