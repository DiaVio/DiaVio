This case involved a 50 year old female driver of a 2011 Honda Accord four door sedan (V1). The driver was not utilizing the available three point lap and shoulder belt, but had a deployed frontal airbag as well as the left seat mounted side impact bag and the left head curtain airbag. The right side head curtain airbag also deployed in the crash, but the right seat mounted airbag did not deploy. The driver was found in the second row seats post impact. The crash involved several impacts to the front and left side of the vehicle. The crash occurred at night on an unlit two lane roadway. The dry asphalt roadway was level and curved to the left. The posted speed limit was 72 kph (45 mph). V1 was traveling south at an unknown speed when it departed the right side of the road and traveled approximately 115 meters before striking some decorative rocks placed next to a private driveway. V1 continued across the driveway and impacted a ditch on the other side with its frontal plane. V1 began to yaw slightly clockwise and sideswiped a small tree. V1 continued rotating clockwise about 80 degrees and struck a larger tree (24 cm) and two small trees with its left side. All three trees broke upon impact with the left side of V1. The larger of the three trees fell on another tree that was 33 cm in diameter with V1coming to rest against both large trees. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized due to the severity of her injuries.
