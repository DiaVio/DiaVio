This case occupant is a 24 year old male driver, not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, who was involved in a single vehicle near-side impact with frontal and side air bag deployments and who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during daylight hours under rainy weather conditions and wet roadways with standing water present. Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Acura RSX two door coupe, was westbound in lane two of a seven lane, two way, asphalt roadway. There are curbs on both sides of the east-west travel lanes and adjacent to the north curb there is a planting strip comprised of grass and medium sized trees. The driver of V1 was approaching an intersecting street and in order to pass slower vehicles traveling ahead of him, moved from lane two into lane one, a right-turn only lane. As V1 continued straight through the intersection, lane one came to an end so the driver of V1 swerved to his left. V1 traveled partially off the right side of the roadway and ramped up and over the curb. V1 returned to lane one, but the driver lost control of the vehicle and V1 began to rotate clockwise as it continued west. While still in a yaw, V1 departed the roadway to the right, traveled a short distance over the planting strip and V1's left side struck a tree, resulting in the deployment of both frontal air bags and the front left side impact air bag. V1 rotated slightly clockwise and came to final rest still in contact with the tree, facing north. V1 was towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 24 year old male, who was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. His steering column mounted frontal impact air bag and outboard seat back mounted side air bag both deployed during the crash. This driver sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
