Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1996 Ford F150, 2-door pickup was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way dirt road. It was dark, the sky was clear, and the dirt road was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and drove left-of-center, crossing the eastbound lane, and departing the left side of the road. V1 traversed a steep embankment and the front of V1 struck a large tree. V1 rotated approximately sixty degrees and came to rest against the tree. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 30-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
