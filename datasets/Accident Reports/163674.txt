Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Honda Civic Hybrid, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 relinquished control of her vehicle and V1 drifted to the left. V1 crossed the centerline, the eastbound lane, and departed the left side of the road at a shallow angle. V1 continued along the road edge for approximately thirty meters until the front of V1 struck a large tree in a left offset-frontal configuration (47% vehicle overlap - VOL). V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 100 degrees and came to rest with its rear wheels on the road surface facing south-southeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 49-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel and seat-mounted air bags deployed. She was transported via air ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries.
