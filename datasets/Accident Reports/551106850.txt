This crash occurred at night with no streets located in the area and the roadway was wet with overcast skies. The speed limit is posted at 50 mph/80 kmph. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Chevrolet Astro Van was southbound on a two lane, two way highway that curved slightly to the right. Vehicle two (V2), a large 1994 Ford F-Series pickup truck was northbound on the same roadway. The driver of V1 was distracted and continued straight over the centerline in the curve. V1 then began to brake and V2 began to steer to the right just before the front left corners of each vehicle impacted. V1 rotated counterclockwise beyond the point of impact and came to rest facing east across the centerline. V2 departed the roadway to the right and came to final rest just off the road edge. The driver of V1 was the case occupant, a 64 year old male, who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the airbag did not deploy. The case occupant was transported to a local hospital and then later brought to the trauma center. Both vehicles were disabled and towed.
