This single vehicle crash occurred on a five lane divided, dry, concrete highway. The right side is bordered with an asphalt curb. A concrete center divider borders the left side. The highway splits at the interchange into four southbound lanes. The right lane turns into two lanes and a gore point separates the two highways. The highway is designated 105 kmph (65 mph.).

Vehicle one (V1) is a 2003 Cadillac CTS 4-door sedan, driven by a thirty three (33) year old male was traveling south in the number two lane. V1 attempted to get over to the right. V1 departed the roadway to the right when its front impacted the gore point. V1 lost control and began to rotate counter clockwise. V1 contacted the embankment on the right side of the roadway. V1 then headed south leading with its right plane. V1 entered the gore point again and rolled over its right side. V1 came to rest on its wheels facing southwest in the number one lane south of the gore point. V1 was towed with rollover damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 105 kmph for V1.

The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded: this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side of travel lane. The critical reason for the critical event was coded to V1 as a driver related factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). The driver had gotten lost on his way home from a business appointment. He was unsure which lane he needed to be in for southbound travel at the "Y" junction of the roadway. The driver said he was looking at the road signs, then in his right mirror to see if he could get into the right lane. He then looked forward again to see the gore point just before the first impact. The driver failed to look far enough ahead. Poor directional control and panic/freezing were considered associative factors of the control loss of the vehicle. The driver works 8 hours per day seven days per week and it had been 56 days since his last day off.
