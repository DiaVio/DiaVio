This crash occurred during daylight hours at an intersection on a two lane highway with a speed limit of 55 mph/89 kmph. It was rainy and the roadway was wet. Vehicle one (V1), a 1999 Ford Taurus four door sedan, was northbound on a two lane roadway and stopped at a stop sign to cross the highway where the east/west traffic had no control and travelling at the speed limit. V1 began to cross the highway when the front of a westbound vehicle two (V2), a semi-tractor pulling one trailer, impacted the right side of V1. This forced V1 laterally and into a slight clockwise rotation off the roadway into a muddy grassy field on the northwest corner of the intersection. V2 continued beyond the intersection for some distance. The case occupant is the driver of V1, a 16 year old male, who was wearing a lap/shoulder belt and was injured. He was transported by medics locally to meet an airlift to the trauma center. V1 was towed and disabled. V2 was driven from the scene.
