The crash occurred on a four-lane undivided roadway in the early morning hours on a weekday. There were two eastbound lanes and two westbound lanes. The roadway was dry, bituminous, level and had a posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). Traffic flow was moderate and sun glare was present.

V1, a 1995 Toyota Camry 4-door sedan with three occupants, was traveling east in lane one. V2, a 2002 Freightliner tractor-trailer, was stopped in traffic in front of V1. V2 was obscured from V1 by sun glare, resulting in V1 striking V2 in the rear of the trailer. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid the collision at the last moment by applying the brakes.

The driver stated that she was on her way to school when she turned onto the eastbound roadway. Her view of the roadway was obscured by sun glare immediately after turning. She proceeded down the road until V2 suddenly appeared in front of her. She attempted to stop before striking the trailer but was unsuccessful.
