This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 54-year old female driver of a 2008 Toyota Corolla CE 4-door sedan. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal collision with a 2003 Nissan Sentra 4-door sedan (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two-lane rural roadway, and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle 2 was southbound on the same roadway, and negotiating a right curve. It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the road was dry. The driver allowed Vehicle 2 to cross the centerline into the path of the northbound Toyota. As Vehicle 2 entered the northbound lane, the front left area impacted the front left area of Vehicle 1. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. At this point, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in a private yard (off the east shoulder) facing southwest. Vehicle 2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest straddling the centerline facing northeast. Following the crash, the belted 54-year old female driver (and sole occupant) of Vehicle 1, was transported to a local hospital for treatment. She was subsequently transferred to a nearby trauma center and admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
