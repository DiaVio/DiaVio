This case involves a 62 year old female driver of a 2008 Kia Sorento sports utility vehicle (V1). She was restrained by the available 3-point manual belt and had deployed frontal steering wheel and knee bolster airbags. The roof side rail head impact airbags did not deploy. The crash occurred in the morning during daylight hours on an interstate highway with four northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. The northbound and southbound lanes were separated by a one meter high concrete barrier. The asphalt roadway was curved slightly to the left with a less than 2% uphill grade. It was raining at the time of the crash. V1 was traveling north in the center lane and was reported to be going the speed limit of 113 kph (70 mph). V1 slid on the wet roadway and traveled across the left lane and struck the concrete barrier with its front left corner. V1 rotated clockwise as it came away from the barrier and rolled five quarter turns to final rest in the center lane on its left side. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
