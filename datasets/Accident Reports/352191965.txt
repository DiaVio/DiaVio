Case Focus: The focus of this case is on an 82-year old, female driver and a 78-year old, right front female passenger, both of a 2006 Chevrolet Malibu which was involved in a right side impact with the frontal plane of a 2000 Chrysler Sebring. Collision Sequence Pre-Crash: This two-vehicle collision occurred during the early evening hours (daylight) of a summer weekday, at the intersection of a north/south trafficway and an east/west roadway. The northern leg of the intersection is composed of three northbound lanes separated by a grassy median from the three southbound lanes. The southbound roadway comprises two through lanes and a dedicated left turn lane and has a left turning curve leading into the intersection. The southern leg of the intersection is composed of two southbound travel lanes separated by a grassy median from three northbound travel lanes. The northbound roadway comprises two through lanes and a dedicated left turn lane and has a slight right turning curve leading into the intersection. The intersection is controlled by standard, tri-colored electric traffic signals, with the north/south trafficway having a speed limit of 40 mph (64 km/h). At the time of the crash, the weather was clear and the roadway surfaces were reported to be dry. Vehicle 1, the 2006 Chevrolet Malibu 4-door sedan, was being operated by the 82-year old female driver (case occupant 1), in the left turn lane, of the southbound roadway, at the northern leg of the intersection. Occupying the right front seating position was the 78-year old female passenger (case occupant 2). Both occupants of Vehicle 1 were restrained by their respective 3-point lap/shoulder belts (with retractor type pretensioner) and the vehicle is noted to be equipped with redesigned frontal impact air bags (second generation). The driver of Vehicle 1 intended to turn left at the intersection and continue traveling eastbound. Vehicle 2, a 2000 Chrysler Sebring 2-door coupe, was traveling northbound, in the left northbound through lane, approaching the intersection from the south. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling north. Crash: Vehicles 1 and 2 entered the intersection at the same time and the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the right side of Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 is suspected to have rotated counterclockwise before coming to rest in the intersection. Vehicle 2 was redirected towards the northeast and also is suspected of coming to rest within the intersection. As a result of the impact, the frontal air bags for Vehicle 1 deployed and the front seat belt pretensioners actuated. Post-Crash: Both the driver and passenger of Vehicle 1 were transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center. The driver (case occupant 1) was hospitalized with minor to serious injuries, while the right front passenger (case occupant 2) was hospitalized with minor to moderate injuries. The driver of Vehicle 2 was also transported, by land unit, to a local trauma center, but the extent of their injuries and treatments, if any, are unknown. Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2 were towed from the scene due to damage sustained in the crash.
