This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a dry, left-curve, two-lane, urban roadway with no traffic controls. The road runs southwest and northeast at the location of the crash and has one lane in each direction. The speed limit on the road is 48 kmph (30 mph) and there were no adverse weather conditions at the time.

Vehicle one, a 1997 Ford Mustang, was southwest bound on the left curve, in lane one, traveling approximately 80 kmph (50 mph). The driver steered to the left to avoid a small animal in the road. The driver then steered to the right while braking and the vehicle skidded off the right side of the road. The vehicle reentered the roadway, traveled across both lanes and then off the left side of the roadway. The front of vehicle one struck a fire hydrant, a chain-link fence and a rock pillar. The vehicle came to rest facing southeast and was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.

The driver of vehicle one, a thirty-three-year-old female, was driving from the golf course to an unknown location to drop off her scorecard. She is familiar with the roadway but only drives the vehicle occasionally. She was fatigued from playing golf for the past five hours. She has also worked more than forty-eight hours in the last seven days, which contributed to her fatigue.

The critical pre-crash event was coded as “object or animal: animal in roadway.” The critical reason for the crash was coded as “driver related factor: too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others: animal crossing road.”
