This case involves an impact between the left side of a passenger car and the front of a pick-up truck, which was towing a trailer. The case vehicle, a 2010 four-door Acura TL, was travelling in the inside eastbound lane of a divided dry, level, asphalt six-lane traffic-way approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and cloudy. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 pick-up truck towing a trailer, was in the westbound left-turn lane of the same traffic-way. As V2 made a left-turn through the intersection it entered the path of the case vehicle. The front of V2 struck the left-front door of the case vehicle. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise into the south leg of the intersecting road where it came to rest facing northeast. V2 came to a controlled stop in the southbound lane of the same roadway. The restrained 64-year-old male driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. He had the benefit of deployed seat-back mounted and curtain air bags. He sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and later transferred to a level-one trauma center where he was enrolled as a case occupant.
