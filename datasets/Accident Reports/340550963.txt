This case involves an impact between the right fender of a passenger car and the front of a medium truck. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle, a 2006 four-door Toyota Prius, was eastbound on a dry, level, two-lane asphalt road, approaching a four-leg intersection. It was daylight and clear. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Freightliner delivery truck, was northbound on the intersecting roadway, approaching the same intersection, with its direction of travel being controlled with a yield sign. It was daylight and clear. As V2 was passing through the intersection, it entered the path of the case vehicle. The front of V2 struck the right side of the case vehicle. After impact, the case vehicle rotated counterclockwise and came to rest north of the intersection, straddling the north and south travel lanes, facing north. V2 came to rest at the northeast corner of the intersection, facing northeast. The only occupant of the case vehicle is the restrained 65-year-old female driver. None of the available frontal and side impact air bags deployed. She sustained multiple moderate injuries to two different body regions. She received no EMS treatment on the crash scene. She was later transported in a personal vehicle to the trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
