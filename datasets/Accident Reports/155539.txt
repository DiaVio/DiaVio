Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2008 Saturn Vue, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the left eastbound through-lane of a five-lane, two-way urban road and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Subaru Outback, 4-door wagon was ahead of V1 and already stopped in traffic awaiting the traffic signal to change. Vehicle three (V3), a 1998 Ford Escort was also eastbound and stopped in traffic in front of V2. Vehicle four (V4), a 2005 Freightliner straight truck was also eastbound, stopped in traffic and was in front of V3. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the concrete road surface was dry. As V1 approached V2, the driver of V1 experienced a syncopal episode and lost consciousness. The front of V1 struck the rear of V2 in a full frontal mode. This impact caused V2 to move forawrd and strike the rear of V3, which in turn moved foreard and struck the rear of V4. V1, V2 and V3 were all towed from the scene due to diabling vehicle damage while V4 was driven away. The 53-year-old driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries.
