This case involves an impact between the front of a passenger car and a concrete barrier. The restrained 60-year-old female driver is the case occupant. The case vehicle, a 2005 Ford Focus sedan, was traveling in the inside southbound lane of a snowy, concrete, three-lane divided traffic-way on a >2% up-grade. Vehicle two (V2), an unknown utility vehicle, was traveling in the middle lane of the southbound roadway. It was dark but lighted and snowy. For unknown reasons, V2 entered into the case vehicle's lane and struck the right-rear door of the case vehicle with its left-fender. This impact caused the driver of the case vehicle to lose control, depart the roadway entering the east distress lane and strike a concrete barrier with its front. The case vehicle was towed due to damage while V2 drove away from the scene in hit and run fashion. The 60-year-old female driver was the only occupant of the case vehicle. She was restrained by a three-point belt. The steering wheel mounted frontal airbag and outboard left seat-mounted side impact air bag deployed. The case occupant was transported to a level-one trauma center with moderate injuries and enrolled as a case occupant.
