This case involves a 33 year old unrestrained male driver of a 2010 Volkswagon Jetta four-door sedan (V1) involved in a T-bone type crash with a 2003 Ford Ranger super cab four door pickup truck (V2). The crash occurred during daylight hours at the intersection of a six-lane trafficway with left and right turn only lanes and a two-lane roadway. The asphalt road was dry with a slight uphill grade for V1. V1 was traveling in the right northbound lane of the six-lane divided roadway at the posted speed limit of 105 kph (65 mph). There was a 2% uphill grade and the asphalt roadway was dry. V2, traveling east on the two-lane roadway at approximately 40 kph (25 mph), crossed over the northbound lanes into the path of V1. The front of V1 struck the right side of V2 causing V2 to spin counterclockwise and roll one quarter turn to final rest on its right side. V1 continued in a northeasterly direction and struck a guardrail, overriding it and impacting the front left wheel. V1 came to rest on top of the guardrail. The driver of V1 was transported by ground ambulance to a level one trauma center and hospitalized for injuries sustained in the crash. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling damage.
