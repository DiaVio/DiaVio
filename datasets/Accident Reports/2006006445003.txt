This single-vehicle rollover occurred on an east/westbound interstate with two lanes of travel in each direction and a posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). While much of this interstate is relatively straight, travel on this portion of roadway required navigating a series of curves. A raised concrete barrier separated the east/west travel lanes. The road surface was bituminous (asphalt) and was dry. The roadway was fairly level and free of any defect. There were no traffic signals present on this interstate. This crash took place on a clear weekend afternoon.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1996 four-door Chevrolet Lumina, was traveling westbound in lane 1, the right curb lane. V1 was driven by a 33-year old female. An interview for this driver could not be obtained. The police narrative indicated that the driver of V1 stated that she was traveling westbound in lane 1 when a white box truck (a non-contact vehicle) traveling in lane 2 cut her off. According to the police narrative, when V1 was cut off by this box truck, the driver of V1 applied the brakes (based on the skid marks) and steered right and, in doing so, lost control of the vehicle and skidded off the roadway. The police narrative also stated that after the driver lost control and skidded onto the right shoulder her vehicle struck the right curb first with its front right, and then its front left tire. Without an interview or other corroborating evidence, it could not be established whether or not another vehicle cut off this driver and caused the loss of control. What is known is that the driver quickly steered to the right and lost control of the vehicle, though the crash events did not take place precisely as described in the police narrative. The skid marks present at the scene were not the result of braking inputs, but rather were "yaw" marks that were created by the front and rear left tires as V1 entered a clockwise spin. The vehicle rotated approximately 180 degrees before it struck the curb and rolled over (sideways) two quarter-turns to the vehicle's left side. The evidence to support this was found in both the distance between the skid marks (yaw marks) and the type of damage that the vehicle sustained. The distance between the yaw marks was far more consistent with the vehicle's wheelbase and not its track width, meaning that it was not the front right and left tires that struck the curb causing the vehicle to roll over, but its front and rear left tires. Additionally, the extensive damage to the rear left tire shows that this was the tire that caused the damage to the curb and was the final event that caused this vehicle to initiate its roll over. Finally, the damage to the vehicle's front right 'A' pillar is commonly seen when a vehicle rolls over to its left along its longitudinal axis after a minimum of 2 quarter rolls. At final rest, the vehicle was lying on its roof in the grass by the side of the interstate facing oncoming traffic. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The following coding was based on the driver's account that she lost control after being cut off by another vehicle, the scene evidence, and the police narrative. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1 was this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-Crash Event was overcompensation, a performance error. No additional associated factors could be coded to this driver due to the lack of interview. It was known that the driver was driving with a suspended license and had an unknown medical condition. The driver had had brain surgery five times. The last surgery took place in early 2005 and it was unknown if any of these surgeries, or condition(s) that were related to them, had any adverse effect on the ability of the driver to operate her vehicle in a normal and safe fashion. The driver also had three occupants in the vehicle, ages 9, 11, and 16.

The driver of V1 was transported by ambulance directly from scene to an emergency room where she underwent a full physical examination. The driver claimed to have sustained no injuries and all medical findings supported her statement. She was very concerned about the occupants of her vehicle and left the hospital before the senior physician on-call could review the findings of the attending physicians. Driver was discharged in less than an hour after being admitted to the emergency room. All occupants were transported to another hospital with unknown injuries.
