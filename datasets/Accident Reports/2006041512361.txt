V1, a 1990 Mercury Grand Marquis with two occupants, was eastbound in lane one. A non-contact vehicle (NCV) was pulling out of a parking lot. The NCV was attempting to exit from the entrance-only driveway. The NCV vehicle pulled out partially into V1's travel lane and stopped. V1 swerved to the left to avoid a collision with the other motorist. V1 then swerved back to the right, and lost control. V1 began rotating clockwise and departed the roadway to the right. V1's left rear tire struck the curb. V1 then traveled off the roadway. The back of V1 struck a crosswalk pole. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

V1, the Grand Marquis, was driven by a 43-year old male, who was not injured. He stated that he was traveling in lane one, when a vehicle pulled out of a parking lot in front of him, causing him to swerve left and lose control of his vehicle on the wet pavement. According to an independent witness, a black Jeep did pull out in front of the driver, stopping in V1's lane. Then the vehicle reversed back into the parking lot and drove off from a different exit. The driver of V1 commented that he saw the other vehicle, but did not think the other car would pull out in front of him.
