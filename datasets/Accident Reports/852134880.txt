This single vehicle crash occurred during daylight hours on a two lane, two way highway with clear, dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Oldsmobile Alero was westbound on this highway and drifted to the right, departing the roadway with the right side tires off the road edge. Driver of V1 then corrected and swerved to left across both lanes and departed the roadway to the left. Off the south of the roadway was a steep embankment so V1 went airborne and was in a slight pitch before the front of V1 impacted a large tree head-on. V1 then rotated clockwise 90 degrees and the back left bumper of V1 impacted a second tree and came to final rest facing north as it landed on the ground. The vehicle was damage and towed. The driver of V1 is the case occupant who was a 21 year old female wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. She sustained severe injuries and was transported to the trauma center. No other occupants were in V1.
