Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1997 Cadillac Catera, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way urban road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Saturn SC2, 2-door coupe was also traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road and was behind V1. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 recognized that they had missed a turn at the previous intersection and she began a U-turn by pulling into a wide driveway on the right-side of the road. The driver of V1 then began to turn around but while V1 was in the middle of this U-turn manuever, the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. The driver of V2 had attempted to avoid the collison by braking but the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. After impact, V1 came to rest in the middle of the road facing south-southeast. V2 came to rest in the westbound lane facing west-northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The driver of V2 sustained possible injuries (police reported) and refused medical attention. The 19-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital where she later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
