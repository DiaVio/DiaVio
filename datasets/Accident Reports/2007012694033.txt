Vehicle #1, a 2007 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan, was traveling east in lane #2. The driver was thinking of another store she needed to stop at before going home. As she checked the lane to her right for traffic, she then looked forward to her lane and saw that there was a vehicle stopped in the lane. The front of V1 contacted the right rear bumper V2, a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer. V2 was pushed forward into the rear of V3, a 1999 Chevrolet Venture van, which had been stopped in front of V2.

Vehicle #1 was driven by a 60-year-old female who reported being in good health despite taking medication for teeth surgery she had recently. She stated she did not take any medication in past 24-hours. She also stated she wears corrective lenses for reading only and was not wearing the lenses at the time of the crash. She stated she had just left the shopping center and as she drove east in lane 2 she thought to herself she would like to stop at one more store before going home. She stated she checked the lane to her right and started to merge into lane 1. As she looked forward again she noted the vehicle stopped in front of her. Not being able to stop, she contacted the right rear side of V2, pushing it forward into another vehicle that had stopped to make a left turn into a driveway on the north side of the roadway. She stated she did not feel it was the medication she had taken from the dentist; she felt that she was just inattentive. She stated she did not know she was that close to the forward vehicles. She stated she refused being transported to the local trauma unit. She stated she was not injured or hurt that bad. She also stated she works the front deck at that hospital and knew how long she would be tied up in the ER. She stated if her back would start to bother her she would go to her doctor the next morning.

Vehicle #2 was driven by a 39-year-old female who stated that she was in good health. She felt her health and sleep had nothing to do with this crash as she stated she was not at fault. She stated she was just out for a drive and was on her way home when the crash occurred. She stated she had come to a stop because there were two vehicles stopped waiting to turn left into a driveway on the north side of the roadway. She stated she was just sitting there and was impacted from the rear and pushed into a van that was in front of her vehicle. She stated that the impact was hard enough to push V3 into a vehicle ahead of it. She stated she was looked at by EMS personal but refused being transported.

Vehicle #3 was driven by a 30-year-old male who stated he was in good health and taking no medications at this time. He stated he was wearing corrective lenses for farsightedness. He stated he and the vehicle ahead of him were going to drop off medical supplies. He stated he heard the tires screeching and looked in his rear view mirror to see V1 contacting V2. He stated he then braced for the impact to his vehicle. He stated he was then pushed ahead to contact the vehicle in front of him but did not do any damage to that vehicle. He stated the EMS personal checked him out on scene and refused transportation because he felt he was not injured in the crash.
