Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was a 1997 Ford Taurus, four-door sedan. Vehicle # 2 was a parked 1994 Plymouth Colt Vista, four-door wagon. There was only one occupant in the case vehicle with the front left occupant (driver) being our case study participant: Driver - was a 72-year-old male/ Frontal air bag (steering wheel) with a manual lap and shoulder belt were available/ Frontal air bag did deployed and it appears the manual lap and shoulder belt was in use. This crash occurred at 22:26 hrs in the evening on a level, two-lane roadway. The roadway had one southbound lane with a paved shoulder and one northbound lane with a curb and sidewalk. It was dark (but lighted) and it was snowing heavily at the time of the crash. The roadway was of bituminous construction (snow covered) with a speed limit of 56kph (35 mph). Vehicle #1 (case vehicle) was initially traveling southward in the southbound lane. V2 was legally parked in the parking lane on the northbound side of the road. During a heavy snowstorm, the driver apparently fell asleep (he was on his way home from work), crossed over into the northbound lane and the front of V1 impacted the front of V2. After the initial impact, V1 also impacted the curb with its left front tire/rim. V1 came to rest against the curb. The driver of V1 was extricated from the vehicle and then transported from the scene to a local trauma center where he was admitted for 21 days for injuries received in the crash.
