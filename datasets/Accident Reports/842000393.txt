This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of an unrestrained 66 year old male driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicle. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of an offset frontal impact with a 1995 Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was westbound on a two-lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the same roadway and negotiating a right curve. As both vehicles reached the apex of the curve, the driver allowed Vehicle 2 to cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 1. As Vehicle 2 entered the westbound lane, the front right area was impacted by the front left area of Vehicle 1 resulting in moderate damage. Following impact, Vehicle 1 came to rest along the north shoulder facing west. Vehicle 2 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in close proximity to point of impact (in the westbound lane) facing northwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. The driver of Vehicle 1 was 190 cm (75 in) in height, and 89 kg (198 lbs) in weight. Both vehicles were towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage.
