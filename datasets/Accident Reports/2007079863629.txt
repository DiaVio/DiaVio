This two vehicle nighttime collision occurred early evening on a five lane, undivided, dry, level, roadway made of asphalt with a two way left turn lane. The roadway runs north and south and is designated 72 kmph (45 mph). The roadway has a very slight curve to the left.

Vehicle one (V1) is a 2001 Nissan Quest minivan, driven by a thirty eight (38) year old male with four passengers. V1 was traveling north in the number one lane. Vehicle two (V2) is a 1999 Kawasaki 500-R Ninja motorcycle driven by a forty (40) year old female. V2 was traveling north in the number two lane behind V1. V1 attempted a u-turn when V2's front impacted the left side of V1. V1 continued west and came to rest facing southwest at the west curb. V2 stopped at impact and fell onto its left side where it came to rest in the two way left turn lane facing north. Both vehicles were towed with major damage. The driver of V2 was pronounced dead at the scene. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1 and Not reported for V2.
