The crash occurred on a straight level two lane undivided roadway with a posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). It was cloudy, the roadway dry and it was daylight at the time of this weekday afternoon crash. The traffic flow was normal for that time of day.

V1, a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt with one occupant, was northbound on the roadway. V1 drifted over into the southbound lane and departed the left side of the roadway. V1 struck a 25 cm pole and sheared it with its front. V1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest facing in a westerly direction. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Not reported for V1.

The driver of V1, a belted 65-year-old female, was transported, treated and released. The driver stated that she was on her way to work from home, had driven approximately 13 miles and drove this route daily. She stated that she was traveling 35-40 mph and then suddenly she became aware that she had just hit a pole across the road. She stated she must have "blacked out". She considered herself in good health, wore bifocals for myopic (near-sighted) and hyperopic (far-sighted) conditions. She had a history of hypoglycemia and a thyroid condition for which she treated with medication. She also indicated that she is still out of work and awaiting test results, since a cause for the "blackout" has not yet been determined.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the left side. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act, a driver related critical non-performance error. This was chosen because the driver stated she blacked out and had no recollection of the crash until after she had hit the pole. There were no known associated factors outside of her previous medical history that could be coded to this driver.
