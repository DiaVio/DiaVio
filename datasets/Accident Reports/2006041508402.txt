The crash occurred in the southbound lanes of a two-way, ten-lane interstate roadway, divided by a concrete traffic barrier. There were five southbound lanes, with a posted speed of 105 kmph (65 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway. Conditions were daylight on a weekday afternoon with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 1999 Pontiac Grand Am with one occupant, was traveling in lane two. V2, a 1992 Chevy C1500 pickup truck with one occupant, was traveling in lane one. The driver of V1 changed lanes to the right. The right side of V1 made contact with the left side of V2. V2 pulled off to the right side of the roadway in a grassy area. V1 began to rotate in a clockwise direction, traveling toward the guardrail on the right side of the roadway. The front left quarter panel of V1 struck the guardrail. V1 continued to rotate, striking the guardrail again with the left rear quarter panel. V1 came to final rest against the guardrail, facing northeast. The driver of V1 fled the scene on foot. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1 and 89 kmph for V2.

V1, the Pontiac Grand Am, was driven by a male driver of unknown age, with an unknown injury status. The driver could not be reached for interview. However, the father of the driver was contacted. He indicated that although he did not know the details of the crash, he believed that his son was probably very distressed at the time of the crash. The father stated that his son had been struggling with an addiction to prescription painkillers, and had recently gotten into trouble with the law. The driver was supposed to turn himself in to authorities the following day, apparently for a violation of his probation. The father of the driver believed this was the probable reason for his son fleeing from the crash scene.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, over the lane line on right side of travel lane." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an unknown driver related error. One possible associated factor for this driver may have been driver inattention due to the personal problem mentioned above, but without an interview, this could not be known for sure.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was "other vehicle encroachment, from adjacent lane over the left lane line." The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to this vehicle.
