This case involves a single front end-plane to side plane crash event resulting in serious injuries to the driver of the case vehicle (case occupant). The case vehicle, a four-door 2002 Kia Sportage SUV, was westbound on a two-lane roadway approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Oldsmobile Bravada SUV was headed northbound in the outside lane of the intersecting four-lane roadway. It was daylight and there were no adverse weather conditions. As the case vehicle crossed through the intersection, it entered the path of V2. The front of V2 stuck the left side of the case vehicle, causing the case vehicle to rotate clockwise and enter the northbound lanes and came to rest facing north-northwest. V2 rotated counterclockwise, ending up in the southbound lanes and came to rest facing northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The 55-year-old female driver was the sole occupant of the case vehicle. She was not restrained by a three-point belt. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to a level-one trauma center.
