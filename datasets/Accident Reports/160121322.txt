This 25-year -old male case occupant was the driver of a 2002 Honda Accord, two-door, that was involved in a severe right side collision with a tree. The case occupant utilized the available three-point seat belt and the available passenger side, seat back side impact air bag deployed upon impact. As the vehicle impacts the tree with the right side the case occupant moved to the right where his head impacted the intruding tree causing the scalp hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage and diffuse axonal hemorrhage. At the same time his right torso struck the passenger seat back causing direct loading of his thoracic spine which resulted in the T1 transverse process fracture. A combination of inertial and deceleration forces caused stretching of the ligaments attached to the spleen which caused the small spleen laceration. As the case occupant rebound to the left he could have struck his face on the left window causing the facial abrasions. It is probable that the abrasions to both knees were sustained as the case occupant struck the knee bolster.
