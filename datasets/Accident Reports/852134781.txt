This two-vehicle head on crash occurred during the early morning when it was dark with street lighted conditions. The roadway surface was wet and the weather was overcast. Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mitsubishi Montero Sport vehicle was eastbound on a two way, two lane highway that curved to the left. The roadway was separated by a divided painted double yellow lane that eventually became a left turn lane for the eastbound direction. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Toyota Matrix compact utility vehicle, was westbound on the same highway and was passing and overtaking another vehicle and crossed the center lane and entered the opposite lane where the front of V1 impacted the front of V2. Both vehicles severely rotated counterclockwise post impact. V2 rotated 270 degrees, as it forced V1 rearward, and came to final rest in the eastbound lane facing north just west of the point of impact. V2 rotated 360 degrees to the southwest from the point of impact and departed the roadway to the south and came to final rest down in the ditch facing east. Both vehicles were severely damage and were towed. The driver of V1 is the CIREN subject and the only occupant in V1. This subject was a 43 year old female who was wearing the manual lap and shoulder belt and the frontal steering column mounted air bag deployed. This driver had severe injuries and was airlifted to the trauma center.
