Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Chevrolet Corvette, 2-door coupe was traveling south in the left southbound lane of a 4-lane, divided, limited access freeway. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the concrete road was dry. The driver of V1 relinquished control of her car due to a medical condition and V1 drifted to the left. V1 crossed the paved median, both northbound lanes and departed the left side of the road. V1 began traversing a steep embankment and upon reaching the top of the embankment, V1 vaulted into the air where the front end struck a tree several meters above the ground. V1 rotated counterclockwise off the tree and rolled with its right side leading back down the embankment. V1 came to rest on its wheels facing south-southwest. The 44-year-old female driver was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported to a local hospital via ground ambulance and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
