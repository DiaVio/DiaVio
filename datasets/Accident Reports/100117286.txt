This case involved the belted front right seat, pregnant passenger of a passenger car responding to a frontal impact into the back of a stopped utility vehicle without air bag deployment. The subject received only a minor hand injury. This crash occurred on a four-lane, divided trafficway traveling through a residential area. The east/west trafficway was straight and had two lanes for travel in each direction separated by a raised curb median. The weather was clear and the afternoon, weekend level, bituminous roadway dry during the weekday crash. The case vehicle (V1, 2005 Volkswagon Jetta, 4-door sedan) was traveling westbound in the number-two lane (left). V1 was equipped with lap and shoulder belts, 1st row seatback mounted side impact air bags, roof rail mounted curtain air bags and first row frontal impact air bags. The 22-year-old male driver and the 20-year-old female front right seat passenger (case subject) were both determined to have been using the belt restraint. The opposing vehicle (V2, 1995 Toyota 4Runner, utility vehicle) was also traveling westbound in the number-two lane and had come to a stop at the end of a line of vehicles waiting for traffic. The driver of V1 (subject) observed V2 stopped ahead and began to slow by releasing the accelerator. At an appropriate time the driver attempted to apply the brake but being unfamiliar with the manual transmission initially used the clutch. At some point the driver was able to regain control of the brake and applied it as the front of V1 struck the back of V2. Both vehicles came to rest at the point of impact facing westbound. The case vehicle's frontal air bags did not deploy. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. The subject was transported to a trauma facility to be evaluated. The driver was not injured.
