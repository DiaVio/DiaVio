This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 69-year-old male belted driver with a deployed frontal airbag. This occupant sustained moderate injuries in a frontal impact. The case vehicle was a compact sedan which struck an intermediate size sedan head-on. The crash occurred early morning in clear weather on a dry roadway in daylight. A 2007 Toyota Corolla compact sedan (Vehicle 1) was traveling southeast approaching an intersection on an urban bituminous multi-lane, two-way roadway. The grade for V1 was 3% downhill at the intersection. A 2011 Toyota Prius intermediate size sedan (Vehicle 2) was traveling northwest approaching the same intersection preparing to turn left. The grade was 3% uphill for V2. V2 began turning left at the intersection as V1 continued straight. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2 (Event 1). Both vehicles came to rest near the point of impact. Both vehicles were towed from the scene. V1 was driven by a 69-year-old male case occupant. He was belted with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The steering wheel hub airbag deployed, while the available top instrument panel airbag did not deploy. There were no other airbags installed on this vehicle. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance where he was later transferred to a trauma center for treatment of moderate injuries.
