V1, a 2004 Lincoln LS sedan, was traveling north on a eight lane, two way roadway under wet, rainy conditions. V2, a 2003 Toyota Camry, was traveling east in lane two of an eight lane, two-way roadway approaching the same intersection. V1 was in the far left lane and attempted to make a left turn at the intersection. The front of V2 contacted the left side of V1, and both vehicles came to final rest in the intersection.

Both vehicles were towed due to damage. The driver of V1, a 61 year-old male, was wearing a three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the seat-mounted thorax side impact air bag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a level-one trauma center for treatment.
