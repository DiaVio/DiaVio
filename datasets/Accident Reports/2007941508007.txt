The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes of a two-way, six-lane roadway, which was divided by a concrete curbed median. There were three eastbound lanes, with a posted speed of 64 kmph (40 mph). This was a straight, level, asphalt roadway, without traffic controls. Conditions were daylight on a weekend morning with dry roads and clear skies. Traffic flow was normal.

V1, a 2003 Chevrolet Trailblazer with four occupants, was traveling eastbound in lane one. The driver drifted to the right, striking the curb with the right front tire. The driver then steered left, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise while traveling toward the curbed median. The right front and/or the right rear tire/rim made contact with the curbed median, causing the vehicle to roll to the right, a total of four quarter-turns. The Trailblazer came to final rest in an upright position, facing west, in the westbound lanes. Police Reported Travel Speed is 64 kmph for V1.

The Chevy Trailblazer was driven by a 30-year old female, who was transported to the hospital due to injury. She could not be reached for interview.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling, off the edge of the road on the right side". The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was an unknown driver-related error. One associated factor for this driver was a vehicle-related steering deficiency. It was a known issue to friends and relatives on-scene that the steering wheel had a lot of play to it, and was not as responsive as it should have been.
