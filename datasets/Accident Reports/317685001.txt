This crash involves the unrestrained 17 year old female driver in a 2013 Honda Civic four door sedan (V1). V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side airbags, and dual side curtains. The steering wheel mounted airbag, right outboard seatback mounted airbag, and both side curtains deployed during the crash. The crash occurred during a misty night on a wet, two-lane, two-way, dark road. The eastbound lane curved to the left and the westbound lane curved to the right. The posted speed limit was 89 kph (55 mph). The roadway was dark and there was no illumination from roadside lighting. V1 was traveling west in the westbound lane of the wet roadway while negotiating a left curve. The rear tires of V1 began to lose traction while in the curve. The driver of V1 noticed the loss of traction and steered right and braked. V1 then departed the roadway to the right. The left side of V1 contacted two trees (3cm and 9cm diameters, respectively). V1 continued a short distance and contacted another tree (20cm diameter) with its front right and then contacted a 16cm diameter tree with its front. V1 came to rest after contacting the fourth tree, facing northwest. V1 was towed from the crash scene due to disabling damage. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment; however, she was later transported to a level one trauma center where she received additional treatment for serious injuries sustained in the crash.
