This case involves a 16-year-old male driver 170 cm. (5' 7") tall and weighing 63 kg (139 pounds, BMI 22). The case occupant was driving a 2002 Ford Explorer, 2-door w/hatch SUV involved in a right side leading rollover, interrupted by a wooden utility pole. The vehicle damage severity was rated as 'severe' based on crush. The case vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and driver and passenger frontal impact air bags. The driver was properly restrained with a 3-point manual belt. The frontal impact air bags did not deploy. As the vehicle rolled and impacted the pole, the occupant's head and right face possibly contacted the pole resulting in extensive cephalohematoma, diastatic fractures of the calvarium, diastatic fractures into left temporal basilar skull, a subdural hemorrhage, a subarachnoid hemorrhage, brainstem contusions, cortical contusions, and left temporal lobe lacerations. He also sustained a left hyoid fracture, a right eye conjunctiva injury, a corneal abrasion, eyelid contusions and laceration, and facial abrasions and contusions. His closed displaced diagonal fracture of distal left femur may have been from loading the door. The source for his bilateral pulmonary contusions, left hemothorax appeared to be contact with the door panel. The liver and mesenteric contusions were sourced to seatbelt loading. The driver also sustained a right shoulder contusion and bilateral leg contusions and abrasions. The driver expired within one hour of the crash at a local trauma center.
