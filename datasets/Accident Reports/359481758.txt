This frontal impact crash case involves a 60 year old female driver, wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, with a deployed frontal air bag who sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred around dawn on a two lane, two way street. In the case vehicle's precrash area, the east-west roadway is level, has a slight curve to the left, and is comprised of asphalt. There are business driveways present on the north side of the street. At the time of the crash, there were clear weather conditions and dry travel lanes. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2009 Kia Optima four door sedan, was traveling west in lane one. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 2002 International 8000 tractor pulling one trailer (enclosed box), was making a left turn out of one of the business driveways. V2 crossed over V1's lane of travel and the front of V1 impacted the left side of V2's trailer, resulting in the actuation of V1's driver's seat belt retractor pretensioner and the deployment of her frontal air bag. V1 underrode V2, resulting in significant V1 passenger compartment intrusion. V1 came to final rest partially under V2's trailer, facing northwest. V2 did not move from the impact and came to rest across both travel lanes, facing southeast. V1 was towed and V2 was able to be driven from the scene. The case occupant is the 60 year old female driver of V1 who was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt. Her seat belt retractor pretensioner actuated and her steering column mounted frontal air bag deployed. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to the trauma center. There were no other occupants in the vehicle.
