This crash occurred during daylight hours at T-type intersections of two highways. The weather was overcast but the roadway surface was wet. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier four door sedan, was northbound on a two lane highway and stopped at a stop sign at an intersection with a crossing two lane, two highway with no traffic controls for the intersection with a speed limit of 55mph/89kmph. An eastbound curb lane for right turns begins also at the intersection. V1 began to make a left turn at the intersection when the front of vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Ford F250 pickup truck traveling eastbound with a slight curve to the left into the intersection, struck the left side of V1. V1 slid laterally to the right and then started to rotate counterclockwise as it separated from the front of V1. The left side front of V1 then swiped the left side front of V2 as V1 started to roll backwards to the east. V2 appeared to steer to the left and continued to angle straight to the northeast and came to final rest in the westbound and partially on the westbound shoulder on the northeast corner area of the intersection. V1 continued to roll backwards while curving to the left, departed south side of the roadway east of the intersection, and into a grass forested area and then came to final rest some distance from the roadway. The driver of V1 is the case occupant and the only person in the vehicle. This case driver was a 21 year old male who was wearing the manual lap/shoulder safety belt and no air bags deployed on this predominantly lateral impact. The driver sustained severe injuries and was airlifted from the scene to the trauma center. The case vehicle was disabled and towed and V2 was driven from the scene. It was noted that V2 had a tow winch mounted on the front of vehicle and masked the damage profile assessments for this case.
