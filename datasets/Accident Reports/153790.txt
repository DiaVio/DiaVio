Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2007 Mercury Mariner, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a four-lane, divided freeway (two lanes eastbound, unprotected median, two lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 International, tractor-trailer was legally parked on the right shoulder of the eastbound lanes, facing east. It was dark, raining, and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V1 was negotiating a right curve when he lost control on the icy surface. V1 began to rotate in a clockwise manner, crossed the right eastbound lane and entered the right shoulder area of the eastbound freeway lanes. The left side of V1 struck the rear of the trailer of V2 which caused V1 to rotate counter clockwise off the trailer. V1 came to rest just off the right paved shoulder, slightly behind V2, facing east. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven away. The 19-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the seat-mounted air bag and left roof siderail-mounted side curtain air bag both deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with severe (AIS-4) injuries. The 56-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the right roof siderail-mounted side curtain air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with multiple moderate (AIS-2) injuries. The 18-year-old female left-rear passenger (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the left roof siderail-mounted side curtain air bag deployed. She was completely ejected through the backlight area during the post-impact rotation of V1 and pronounced dead at the scene with multiple severe (AIS-4) injuries. The 18-year-old male right-rear pasenger (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the right roof siderail-mounted side curtain air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate (AIS-2) injuries.
