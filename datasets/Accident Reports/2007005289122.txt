This one-vehicle crash occurred at night on a weekday on a two-way, two-lane roadway, which was not physically divided. The bituminous roadway had a left curve and a slight uphill grade for traffic traveling north. There were no traffic control devices associated with this particular stretch of roadway. The posted speed limit was 40kmph (25mph). There were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash and traffic flow was normal for the time of day.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2003 Mitsubishi Galant, was heading north on the roadway negotiating the left curve. The vehicle drove off of the right side of the roadway for approximately 34 meters and could not regain control. The front of the vehicle initially struck a large tree. After the impact, the vehicle rotated counter clockwise approximately 90 degrees when it struck a smaller tree with the right side of the vehicle. The vehicle came to final rest off of the right side of the roadway facing west. The vehicle had to be removed from the scene due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 80 kmph for V1.

The driver of V1, a 23 year-old male, suffered unknown injuries and was flown to a medical facility for treatment. There were no other occupants in the vehicle when the crash occurred. The out-of-state driver could not be reached for an interview. For this reason it is uncertain if any fatigue or health related factors contributed to this crash.

The Critical Precrash Event coded to this vehicle was: this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The Critical Reason was coded as: unknown decision error. A couple of associated factors were the presence of alcohol as well as excessive speed.
