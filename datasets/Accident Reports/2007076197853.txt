This single-vehicle rollover crash occurred in a rural area on a three-lane asphalt roadway. The 2 westbound lanes are uphill and curve right at the area of control loss. The speed limit is 89 kmph (55 mph). The crash occurred at dawn with no adverse weather or road conditions.

Vehicle one (V1), a 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup driven by a nineteen (19) year old male, was westbound in the #1 lane negotiating a right hand curve. V1 departed the right road edge as it rotated clockwise. The right side plane then contacted a rock embankment on the roadside for approximately 5 meters (16 feet) before rolling left 3 quarter turns then rolling once back onto its top coming to rest in across the westbound lanes facing southwest. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is 89 kmph for V1.

No interview was obtained with this driver. The driver stated to police that he was traveling to work when he heard his tire blow and lost control. The vehicle inspection found this statement to be incorrect.

The critical pre-crash event was coded: this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn. Poor directional control and overcompensation were associative factors for the driver. The roadway had virtually no shoulder on the right side due to the embankment and this was considered a roadway factor for this crash.
