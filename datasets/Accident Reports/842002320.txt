This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a restrained 22 year old male driver of a 2001 Chevrolet S-10 4x2 pickup truck. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1), was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions. The driver frontal air bag deployed as a result of a right side impact with a large diameter tree (event #1). Vehicle 1 was northbound on a two lane rural roadway and negotiating a left curve. As Vehicle 1 reached the apex of the left curve, it departed the right (east) pavement edge. Driver steering maneuvers re-directed the vehicle back onto the roadway in a counterclockwise rotation. Vehicle 1 subsequently traversed the roadway and departed the left (west) pavement edge into a private yard. As Vehicle 1 exited the west pavement edge, the right side surface impacted a large diameter tree resulting in severe damage (event #1). Vehicle 1 came to rest against the struck tree facing southwest. The driver of Vehicle 1 was transported to a local trauma center and hospitalized for treatment of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Vehicle 1 was towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
