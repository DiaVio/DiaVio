This case involves a right side impact resulting in moderate injuries to the driver (case occupant #1), moderate injuries to the right front passenger (case occupant #2) and serious injuries to the left rear passenger (case occupant #3). The crash occurred in the evening after dark at the 4-leg intersection of north-south and east-west roadway. The weather was clear and dry and the roadway was illluminted by street lights. Both north-south and east-west roadways are two lane two way roadways, separated by a solid yellow line. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. Vehicle one (V1- case vehicle) is a 2004 four-door Dodge Neon, 4 door passenger sedan and vehicle two (V2) is a 1995 four-door Ford Explorer, sport utility vehicle. V1 was traveling east on the eastbound roadway and was intending to go straight through the intersection. V2 was traveling north on the northbound roadway intending to go straight through the intersection. The frontal plane of V2 impacted the right side plane of V1. This initiated a counter clockwise rotation for V1 which came to final rest facing south in the northbound lane. V2 came to final rest in the middle of the intersection facing north. Both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 42 year old female (case occupant #1) restrained by the 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. A 14 year old male (case occupant #2) was seated in the right front passenger seat and was restrained by 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. Both the steering wheel mounted air bag and the frontal passegner air bag deployed during the crash event. An 8 year old female seated in the left rear passenger seat (case occupant #3) was restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. All three case occupants were transported by flight units to a trauma center.
