This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a 74-year-old male belted driver with no deployed airbags. He sustained serious injuries in a near-side crash. The subject vehicle was a compact sedan struck on the driver's side by a large pickup truck. The crash occurred in the early afternoon hours in cloudy weather on a dry road. A 2005 Nissan Sentra compact sedan (Vehicle 1) was waiting to turn left at a three-way intersection on an urban bituminous two-way, three-lane road facing northeast. There was a moderate downhill grade for this vehicle. A 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 large pickup truck (Vehicle 2) was traveling southeast approaching the same intersection. V2 was traveling in the second lane of a four-lane, two-way road with a 3% downhill grade. V1 proceeded to turn left at the intersection as V2 entered the intersection. The left plane of V1 was impacted by the front plane of V2 (Event 1). V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 70 degrees, coming to rest in the road. V1 sustained moderate damage; both vehicles were towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 74-year-old male case occupant. The driver was using the available lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. The available steering wheel hub airbag did not deploy. This vehicle was not equipped with seatback or curtain airbags. The driver suffered serious injuries and was transported by ground ambulance to a local hospital, where he was subsequently transported to a nearby trauma center. V1 was also occupied by a 75-year-old female right front non-case occupant who suffered police-reported non-incapacitating injuries. She was using the available lap and shoulder belt with an actuated retractor pretensioner. Her available front instrument panel airbag did not deploy. She was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance.
