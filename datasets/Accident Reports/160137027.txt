Vehicle one (V1), a 2005 Kia Sorrento utility vehicle, was traveling south in lane one of a two lane, two-way roadway under dry, daylight conditions. For unknown reasons V1 departed the road to the right side and struck a tree with its front right bumper. V1 then rotated clockwise and came to rest in the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. The driver and sole occupant of V1, a 25-year-old female, was not wearing the available three-point lap and shoulder belt and had the frontal steering wheel mounted airbag deploy. The driver of V1 was transported to a local hospital for treatment and then transferred by helicopter to a level-one trauma center.
