Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. It was dark, cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 ran off the right side fo the paved surface and steered left in an attempt to regain control. V1 re-entered the road in a counter clockwise yaw, crossed both lanes, and departed the left side of the road. The right side of V1 struck a small tree and then the vehicle began to trip over its right wheels. While rolling over the top of V1 struck two trees (one across the A-pillars and windshield and one across the mid-roof). After stiking the last tree, V1 rotated around the tree (while inverted 90 degrees), separated from the tree and fell to the ground. V1 came to rest on its roof facing in a northerly direction. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 28-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was the sole occupant of V1. She was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
