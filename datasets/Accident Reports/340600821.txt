This case involves an impact between the front of a station wagon and a compact SUV. The restrained drivers of the collision partners are both case occupants. Vehicle one (V1), a 2011 Ford Edge station wagon was northbound on a wet, two-lane, asphalt road with a up-grade, approaching the crest of a bridge. Vehicle two (V2) a 2005 Ford Escape compact SUV was southbound on the same roadway, also on an up-grade, approaching the crest of the same bridge. V2 drifted across the center-line and entered the path of V1. The driver of V1 attempted to avoid a collision by steering right. V2 struck V1 in a full frontal mode. The vehicles came to rest straddling the northbound travel and distress lanes on the crest of the bridge. It was daylight and foggy. Both vehcles were towed due to damage. The only occupant of vehicle one is the restrained 39-year-old female driver. She had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel mounted air bag. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and then transferred to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant. Vehicle two is the case vehicle in another case. The only occupant of the second case vehicle is the restrained 22-year-old female driver. She had the benefit of a deployed steering-wheel mounted air bag. She sustained serious injuries and was transported to an outside hospital and then transferred to a level-one trauma center where she was enrolled as a case occupant.
