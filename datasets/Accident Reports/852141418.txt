The case occupant is the 27 year old male driver involved in a moderate severity side impact crash into a utility pole who was lap/shoulder belted and sustained serious injuries. This crash occurred during the morning daylight hours with overcast skies and dry conditions. Vehicle one (V1), a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 four door pickup truck, was eastbound on a two lane, two way roadway that curved to the left. V1 departed the roadway to the right off the south road edge. The right tires of V1 then bounced over a driveway with culverts that may have directed V1 slightly clockwise. V1 then continued in some tall grassy area when the front impacted a sign post before the left side of V1 impacted a utility pole and the right side swiped the guy wire holding the pole. V1 then rotated counterclockwise slightly and came to final facing east. V1 was damaged and towed. The case driver of V1, a 27 year old male, was wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt, and sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to the CIREN trauma center. A front right passenger, a 29 year old male, was also wearing the manual lap/shoulder belt and sustained only minor injuries.
