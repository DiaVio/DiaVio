This single vehicle rollover crash occurred during daylight hours on a two way, three lane roadway with the center lane for left turns at an intersection. The weather was clear and dry and the bituminous surface was noted at the time of this crash to be covered slightly with sand and dirt. Case vehicle one (V1), a 2000 Buick Regal four door sedan, was northbound on this roadway that had a slight downgrade, and crossed over an intersection with center left turn lanes and no traffic controls for the north and south directions. Beyond the intersection is when V1 lost control and began to rotate counterclockwise across the southbound center turn lane. V1 continued sliding laterally across the southbound lane and west shoulder and departed the roadway into the ditch with an embankment where the right side tires had gouged into the mud. With V1's back end leading the vehicle rolled over to the right on to its roof top. The back header of the roof then dug into the embankment and rotated the front of V1 to the east where it came to final rest on its roof top with the front hood on the shoulder and the back end on the embankment. V1 had to be flipped back on to its tires before being towed due to damage. The case occupant is the driver of V1 who was a 78 year old female and restrained with the lap and shoulder belt and the only occupant in V1. She sustained serious injuries and transported to the trauma center.
