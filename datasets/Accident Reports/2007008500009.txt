The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was “this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection.” The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was “driver related factor, inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see.” The driver stated that the stop sign was placed far back from the roadway, making it difficult to see around the hillside. He crept up towards the roadway several times after his initial stop, looking in both directions for traffic. When he thought that it was clear he entered the roadway without seeing V2. The driver is inexperienced, with roughly one year of driving history. The position of the stop sign most likely added to his confusion of the situation.

The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was “other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street, turning into opposite direction.” The Critical Reason was not coded to this vehicle. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 stopped at the stop sign. V1 then suddenly pulled out in front of her and she braked her vehicle heavily, but was unable to bring the vehicle to a stop in time.
