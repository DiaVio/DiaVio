This case involves a passenger car that departed the roadway and a concrete median barrier with the left-front corner of its front end. The case occupant is the restrained driver of the passenger car. The case vehicle a 2001, four-door Buick LeSabre was southbound, in the center-lane of a dry, level, three-lane asphalt roadway of a divided six-lane traffic-way approaching the beginning of a deceleration lane for an exit ramp. The driver reportedly lost control of the vehicle and the case vehicle crossed over the lane line on the left, traversed the outside lane, departed the roadway, obliquely struck a concrete median barrier with its front-left corner (event 1), rode up on the barrier, side-swiped a concrete median barrier with its left side as it came down (event 2), re-entered the roadway, crossed all three lanes and came to rest on the west roadside south of the gore for the exit ramp. It was daylight and clear. The sole occupant of the case vehicle was the restrained 56-year-old female driver. She had the benefit of deployed frontal-impact and seat-back mounted air bags. The driver sustained a moderate injury and was transported to a level-one trauma center and enrolled as a case occupant.
