Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Kia Sedona, minivan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a three-lane, two-way road (one lane north, center turn lane, one lane south). It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 expeienced a seizure and relinquished control of the vehicle by driving straight when the road curved to the right. V1 crossed the center turn lane and the southbound lane, departed the left side of the road and struck a large tree with the front of her vehicle. V1 came to rest against the tree. The 30-year-old female driver was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. The right-front passenger was a 4-year-old male who was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. The second row-left passenger was a 10-year-old female who was using the available three-point seat belt. The second row-right passenger was a 2-month old female who was seated in a rear-facing child seat, using the child seat harness, and the child seat was secured to the vehicle via the three-point seat belt. The third row-right passenger was a 9-year-old female who was unrestrained. The driver and second row-right passenger were taken to a local hospital via ground ambulance and were subsequently transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The other occupants of the case vehicle were transported via helicopter directly to a regional level-one trauma center. All occupants of the case vehicle are case occupants. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage.
