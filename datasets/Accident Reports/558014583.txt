The case vehicle, a 1998 Ford Escort sedan, was northbound on a four-lane asphalt roadway in the outside lane. It was dark, but lighted, there were no adverse weather conditions at the time, but the roadway was wet. The case vehicle was approaching a point where the roadway narrows to two lanes. Vehicle two (V2) a 1993 Cadillac Deville sedan was legally parked and facing north in the parking lane, beyond the transition from a four to a two-lane roadway. Vehicle three (V3) a 2001 Ford Taurus, was southbound on the same roadway on the two-lane section of roadway. V2 had been in a previous rear-end accident, that had broken out the tail-lights. The driver of the case vehicle did not see V2 until, she was closing on it and veered to the left to avoid an impact. The case vehicle entered a counterclockwise yaw and struck the rear of V2 with its right quarter panel. The case vehicle then rotated clockwise across the center line and entered the path of V3. V3 struck the case vehicle on both of the left side doors.
