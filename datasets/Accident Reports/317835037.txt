This case focuses on an unrestrained 16 year old male driver in a 2012 Chevrolet Camaro (V1). There was also an unbelted 15 year old male right front passenger and an unrestrained 15 year old male left rear passenger in V1. V1 was equipped with dual frontal airbags, dual side curtains, and dual first row side airbags. All airbags deployed during the crash. V2, a 2011 Nissan Altima was also involved in the crash. The crash occurred during the nighttime hours on a dry two-way asphalt roadway that was divided by a painted median. There were no adverse weather conditions and the posted speed limit was 80 kph (50 mph). The roadway was not lighted. V1 was traveling south ahead of V2 in a one lane, one-way (southbound) lane while negotiating a right hand curve. The driver of V2 attempted to pass and overtake V1 by steering left, accelerating, and entering the painted median area. As V2 accelerated and moved left, its right rear contacted the left rear of V1. This impact caused the driver of V1 to lose control of his vehicle. After impact, V1 veered right onto the roadside and traveled on the roadside in a ditch. While in the ditch V1 contacted a concrete culvert adjacent to a private drive with its front. This impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and trip on the ground with its right side tires. V1 rolled with its right side leading two-quarter turns and came to rest on the private drive while on its top. V1 faced east while at final rest. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling damage. V2 drove to final rest on the right roadside and was neither towed nor disabled. The unrestrained driver of V1 was transported from the crash scene to a local hospital. He was later taken to a level one trauma center where he received additional treatment for serious injuries that he sustained in the crash. The right front occupant did not sustain injury during the crash. The left rear passenger was transported to a medical facility; however, his treatment status is unknown.
