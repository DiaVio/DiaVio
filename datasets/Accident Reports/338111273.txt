This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted 68-year old female driver, and belted 53-year old female front right passenger, of a 2009 Chevrolet HHR. The case vehicle (Vehicle 1) was equipped with frontal air bags for the driver and front right passenger positions (non-deployed). The case vehicle was also equipped with curtain air bags (for all outboard seating positions) which deployed as a result of a right angle impact with a 2005 Volvo XC70 station wagon (Vehicle 2). Vehicle 1 was northbound on approach to a 4-leg urban intersection. Vehicle 2 was eastbound on the inboard lane of a multi-lane roadway, and proceeding straight. It was daylight; with no adverse weather conditions as the roads were dry. Traffic control consisted of overhead tri-lights, which were in red phase for east/westbound vehicles. Vehicle 1 entered the intersection to proceed straight (north), across the path of the eastbound Volvo. As both vehicles entered the intersection, the left side surface of Vehicle 1 was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2. Impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1. The initial impact re-directed each vehicle to final rest in the northeast sector of the intersection, facing northeast. Following the crash, the belted 68-year old female driver, belted 53-year old female front right passenger, and belted 14-year old male rear left passenger of Vehicle 1, were transported to a local trauma center for treatment. The front occupants of Vehicle 1 were subsequently admitted for further treatment of serious injuries sustained in the collision. The treatment status of Vehicle 1's rear left child passenger was unknown. Both vehicles were towed from the crash site due to disabling damage.
