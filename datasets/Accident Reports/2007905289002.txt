This one-vehicle crash occurred just beyond a T- intersection on a weekend afternoon. Both the north/south and east/west roadways that composed the intersection were bituminous, straight, and level. The only traffic control device present was a stop sign for eastbound traffic. The posted speed limit was 40 kmph (25 mph). The roadway was partially covered with snow but there were no adverse atmospheric conditions at the time of the crash.

Vehicle one (V1), a 1991 Honda Accord, was northbound approaching the intersection where it intended to turn left. As V1 turned the driver lost control of the vehicle and struck the curb as it departed roadway off the right side. After leaving the roadway, the driver struck a guide wire for a utility pole. V1 than rolled left one quarter turn and came to final rest on its left side in the westbound lane of the roadway. V1 was towed due to damage. Police Reported Travel Speed is Unknown for V1.

The driver of V1, a 17 year-old male, was uninjured in the crash. The other occupant in the right front seat also did not suffer any injuries. After numerous attempts, an interview could not be obtained from the driver of this vehicle. It is therefore unknown if any fatigue or health related issues contributed to this crash.

The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded this vehicle loss of control due to traveling too fast for conditions. Based pm evidence at the scene and information relayed by the police, the Critical Reason was coded as a decision error traveling too fast for conditions. Associated factors include the snow-covered roadways and driver inexperience (due to the driver's age).
