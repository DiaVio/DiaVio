This case involves a belted 53-year-old female driver of a passenger car responding to a 'moderate' Frontal impact (offset left with air bag deployment) with a guardrail and subsequent, right side leading, four quarter-turn rollover. The subject sustained serious injury as a result. This single vehicle crash occurred on the westbound side of a multilane interstate. There were four lanes for travel. The crash site was in the immediate proximity (just prior to) of an interchange. The south (left, median) roadside consisted of a level paved shoulder, a level dirt shoulder and a guardrail protecting an overpass pillar. The weather was clear and the concrete roadway dry during the morning (daylight), weekday crash. The Case Vehicle (2005 Nissan 350Z, 2-door sedan) was traveling westbound in the number-three (3rd from right). The vehicle was equipped with lap and shoulder belts and first row frontal impact air bags. The driver (case subject/sole occupant) was using the belt restraint as supported by physical evidence. The subject, possibly startled by a vehicle changing lanes on her right, apparently steered to the left in an extreme manner causing the vehicle to begin a counter-clockwise yaw as it traveled off of the left (south) roadside. The front of the vehicle struck the guardrail with a 1 o'clock principal direction of force. The vehicles' frontal impact air bags deployed. The impact accelerated the counterclockwise rotation and the vehicle overturned across it to the right, four quarter-turns, coming to rest on its wheels facing west on the median shoulder. The vehicle was towed due to disabling damage. The subject (driver) was transported to a trauma facility due to serious injury(s).
