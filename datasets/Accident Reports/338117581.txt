This investigation focused on the injury mechanisms of a belted, 47-year old, female driver with a deployed airbag. She sustained serious injuries in a rear-end crash with a heavy truck. The crash occurred mid-morning in dry, clear weather. A 2009 Honda Odyssey 4-door sedan (v1) was traveling north while negotiating a gentle right curve. The roadway was suburban, bituminous, two-way, two-lane, and undivided. The grade was 2% uphill approaching stopped traffic ahead. A 1999 Sterling 3-axle straight truck (v2) was stopped facing north ahead of v1 waiting for traffic to proceed. V1 continued traveling north and impacted the rear of v2 with its front plane. V1 underrode the rear of v2 allowing v1's windshield to contact v2's back plane. Both vehicles came to rest at the point of impact. Neither vehicle was reported to be towed due to damage. V1 was driven by a 47-year old female case occupant who was restrained by a lap and shoulder belt. The retractor pretensioner actuated and the steering wheel hub airbags deployed. The available curtain and seatback airbags did not deploy. This occupant was transported to a local hospital by ground ambulance. She was diagnosed with serious injuries and transferred to a local trauma center.
