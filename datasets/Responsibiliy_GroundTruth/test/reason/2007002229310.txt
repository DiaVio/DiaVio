Reason: Vehicle #1 was traveling northbound on the roadway and failed to adequately surveil the road ahead, resulting in a collision with the stopped Vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to not paying attention and having a lapse in judgment, referring to it as a "brain fart." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not exercising proper surveillance and failed to notice the stopped Vehicle #2 in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
