The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 attempted to turn left from the wrong lane, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1 was distracted by both internal factors (conversing with the passenger) and external factors (looking for the passenger's son and a parking spot). - V1 was also upset about having to travel a long distance to pick someone up from court, which may have contributed to her distraction and error in judgment. While V2 claimed that V1 suddenly turned left in front of him, V2's responsibility is not coded in the given information. However, it is worth noting that V2 was driving on a suspended license at the time of the crash, which is a separate violation and may have contributed to his inability to avoid the collision.
