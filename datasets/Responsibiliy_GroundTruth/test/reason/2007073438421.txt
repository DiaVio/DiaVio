The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 1993 Cadillac Eldorado). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." While V2 was noted to have encroached over the left lane line from the opposite direction, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2's vehicle. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly observing the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
