The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through the green light. The driver did not look to the left and failed to detect V1 approaching, resulting in the collision. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance is the critical reason for the critical event. Additionally, it is worth noting that V1 entered the intersection on a red light and had an exterior distraction, which could have contributed to the accident. However, the critical reason was not assigned to V1, indicating that V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection was the primary cause of the crash.
