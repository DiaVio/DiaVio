The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 was attempting to merge into the left turn lane and make a left turn. However, during the merging maneuver, the driver allowed the vehicle's front left wheel to strike the raised curb median, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and cross into the path of V1. This action by the driver of V2 resulted in the collision between V1 and V2.
