The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to see the traffic signal change to red, indicating that they should have stopped. This failure to obey the traffic signal led to V2 (the 2005 Silver Chevrolet Impala) striking the left side of V1. V2's actions, such as disregarding the traffic signal and being unfamiliar with the roadway, may have contributed to the accident, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to stop at the red light.
