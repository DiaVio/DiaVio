The driver of V1 made a left turn without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic from the opposite direction. This recognition error led to the collision with V2, which was traveling in the northbound lane. The driver of V1 stated that he looked left but failed to see V2 approaching. Additionally, an associated factor of low tread on the tires of V1 may have contributed to the driver's inability to maneuver and avoid the crash.
