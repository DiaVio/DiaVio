The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn across the northbound lanes from the center-turn lane. V1 failed to adequately survey the traffic in lane 1 before making the turn. Although V1 assumed that lane 1 was clear because the other northbound traffic had stopped, he did not have confirmation that it was safe to proceed. This lack of proper surveillance and proceeding with insufficient clearance led to V1 entering the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and ensure that it was safe to make the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
