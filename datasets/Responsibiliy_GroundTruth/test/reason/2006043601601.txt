The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and collided with the back of V2 (the driver of the Ford Focus) while V2 was slowing down for another vehicle turning left ahead. V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react in time to the slowing traffic indicates a lack of attention and negligence on the part of V1. Additionally, V1's statement that he tried to brake and steer to the right to avoid colliding with V2, but V2 steered to the right at the same time, suggests that V1 did not have proper control of his vehicle. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to react appropriately to the situation make him primarily responsible for the accident.
