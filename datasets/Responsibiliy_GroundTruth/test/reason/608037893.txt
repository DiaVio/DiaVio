The reason for this is that V2 drifted into the west distress lane, rode up onto a mountable curb, and then attempted to steer back into the westbound lane but over-corrected and lost control of the vehicle. This resulted in V2 crossing the center line and entering the path of the case vehicle, causing the collision.
