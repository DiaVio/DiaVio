The driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with her daughter, which caused her to momentarily look away from the road. When she looked back, she saw V2 (the 1998 K1500 Tahoe SUV) stopped in the traffic lane but was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision. While V2 was also involved in the crash, the critical reason for the critical event was not coded to V2. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
