The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver's foot slipped off the brake pedal onto the accelerator, causing the vehicle to lurch forward and collide with both V2 and V3. The driver of V1 admitted to this mistake and stated that he noticed a leaf stuck to the bottom of his right foot, which likely caused his foot to slip off the brake. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and react in time after the foot slipped off the brake pedal is the main reason for the collision.
