The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by looking at his speedometer, which caused him to not notice that V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale) was stopped ahead of him. Additionally, V1's tires were deficient (no tread on the front tires) and over-inflated, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time to avoid the collision. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was also inexperienced and admitted to being fatigued, which may have impaired his ability to react appropriately in the situation. On the other hand, V2 is not thought to have contributed to the crash as there were no known associated factors coded to V2, and the driver's critical event was simply being in the lane with a higher rate of speed. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors such as distraction, fatigue, tire deficiencies, and inexperience.
