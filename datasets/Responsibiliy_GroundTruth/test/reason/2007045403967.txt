The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling at a high rate of speed (60-70 mph) in a 45 mph zone. This aggressive behavior of traveling too fast for the conditions and exceeding the speed limit contributed to the collision. V1 admitted to seeing V2's headlights before it turned, but was unable to avoid the collision due to their excessive speed and locked-up brakes. Additionally, V1's lack of explanation for why they were traveling so fast suggests a disregard for safety and a lack of experience in handling their vehicle at high speeds.
