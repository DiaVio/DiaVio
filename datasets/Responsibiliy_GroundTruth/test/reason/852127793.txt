The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which means they had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V1, the 2003 Honda Civic, was traveling straight through the intersection in their designated lane. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the head-on collision.
