The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that he looked both ways but did not notice any cars approaching. However, V2 (the driver of the gray Ford Crown Victoria) was approaching the intersection from the southbound direction and collided with the right side of V1. V2 had the right of way as they were traveling straight through the intersection, while V1 was required to yield and ensure it was safe to make the left turn. The fact that V1 was looking to his left (away from V2) while making the left turn suggests a lack of attention and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
