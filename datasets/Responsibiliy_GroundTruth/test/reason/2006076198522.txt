The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control. V1 was passing a tractor-trailer in the second lane when the tractor-trailer began to change lanes without being aware of V1's presence. In an attempt to avoid contact, V1 steered left and applied the brakes, causing the vehicle to depart the road edge with its left tires. This loss of control led to V1 crossing the roadway, impacting trees, and ultimately coming to rest on the right shoulder. V1's poor directional control and inability to maintain control of the vehicle in a potentially dangerous situation contributed to the crash.
