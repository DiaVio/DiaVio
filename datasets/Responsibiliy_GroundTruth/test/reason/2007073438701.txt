The reason for this is that V1 turned left at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic in the eastbound lane. The driver's father stated that V1 waited but turned left even though she could not see if there was any traffic in the eastbound lane. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and ensure that it was safe to make the left turn.
