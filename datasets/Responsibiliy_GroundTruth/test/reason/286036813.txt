The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver became distracted and failed to notice the roadway narrowing, resulting in the impact with the stone incline of the bridge wall. This distraction, indicated by the presence of the open cell phone on the front dashboard, suggests that the driver was talking on her cell phone at the time of the crash. This distraction led to the loss of control of the vehicle, causing it to pitch upwards along the wall incline, roll onto its side, and eventually come to rest on its roof.
