The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. Even though V2 had the right-of-way according to local regulations, V2 still had the duty to ensure that it was safe to make the turn. V2 admitted to assuming that V1 would stop for the red traffic light, which indicates a failure to exercise caution and properly assess the situation. Additionally, the witness and driver statements confirm that V2 had stopped in the intersection and made the left turn after the traffic light entered the red phase. This further supports V2's responsibility for the collision. In contrast, V1's critical reason for the event was coded as an illegal maneuver, indicating that V1 may have encroached into the left lane of oncoming traffic. However, V1's actions alone would not have caused the collision if V2 had properly yielded and waited for a safe opportunity to make the left turn. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to yield and exercise caution while making the left turn.
