The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the southbound travel lane while traveling northbound and struck the left side plane of Vehicle 2. Witnesses reported that Vehicle 1 had been traveling in and out of its travel lane prior to the crash, indicating a lack of proper lane control. Additionally, Vehicle 1's driver was not restrained by her seatbelt, which may have contributed to her inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
