The reason for this is that V1 drifted over the right lane line and struck V2 in the left rear bumper, causing V2 to lose control and collide with the cement wall barrier. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain proper lane control and encroached into the adjacent lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related performance error: poor directional control. This suggests that V1 was not able to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, further supporting their responsibility for the crash. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane. While V2 may have encroached into the adjacent lane, it was V1's initial drifting and collision that caused V2 to lose control and collide with the barrier. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain proper lane control and causing the collision with V2.
