The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left-hand turn. She stated that she did not see V2 approaching from her left side. This recognition error, coupled with the fact that V1 thought it was a four-way stop when it was actually a two-way stop, led to her failure to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1's reported use of high blood pressure medication, which can cause dizziness and tiredness, may have contributed to her inadequate surveillance and recognition error. On the other hand, V2's actions do not appear to have contributed to the crash. He reported seeing V1 approaching the intersection and believed she would stop due to the red light. He attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left but was unable to do so. Therefore, V2 is not considered primarily responsible for the accident.
