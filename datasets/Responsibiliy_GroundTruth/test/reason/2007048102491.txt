The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it traveled off the right side of the roadway, striking a concrete-base mailbox and a culvert. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 89 kmph, which exceeds the speed limit of 56 kmph. This suggests that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to negotiate the left curve prior to the crash area. Furthermore, the fact that the driver of V1 left the scene and was not located indicates a lack of responsibility and accountability, further supporting the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
