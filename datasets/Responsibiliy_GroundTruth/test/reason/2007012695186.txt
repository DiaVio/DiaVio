The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed and failed to see the other vehicles in the intersection. He also admitted to not attempting any avoidance actions. Additionally, the driver's license was suspended, indicating a potential disregard for traffic laws. These factors suggest that V1 was not exercising proper surveillance, was engaging in an illegal maneuver by failing to obey the traffic control device, and was inexperienced with the vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise caution, obey traffic laws, and properly observe the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
