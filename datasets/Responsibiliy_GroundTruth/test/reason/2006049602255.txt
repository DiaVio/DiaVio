The driver of V1 made a left turn at the intersection without adequate surveillance and with an obstructed view. The driver stated that the protective left turn arrow was not illuminated, but the oncoming traffic was stopped and let him make the turn. However, he did not see V2 approaching the intersection due to the vehicles in the eastbound lanes and the uphill slope of the road. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic, as well as the obstructed view, led to the collision with V2.
