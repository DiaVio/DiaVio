The reason for this is that V1 was exiting the shopping plaza and attempting to turn left onto the two-way roadway. V2 (the driver of the Mercury Tracer) was already traveling in the left lane of the westbound direction when V1 pulled in front of it from the driveway. V2 stated that she saw V1 entering the roadway and tried to avoid the crash by braking and steering to the left, but was unable to do so and struck V1. Since V1 was making a left turn across the oncoming traffic, it was their responsibility to ensure that it was safe to do so. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
