The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of other's actions. She stated that she had been stopped for more than 10 seconds and waited until other traffic had a red light before proceeding to make a left turn. However, she failed to properly assess the situation and misjudged the actions of Vehicle #2. Despite having a flashing red light at the driveway exit, she assumed that Vehicle #2 would stop like the other cars. This false assumption led to her entering the intersection and being struck by Vehicle #2. Additionally, it should be noted that Vehicle #1's driver was taking multiple prescription medications, some of which had possible side effects of drowsiness, dizziness, and fatigue. While it is not explicitly stated that these medications impaired her ability to drive, it is a factor that may have contributed to her false assumption and lack of judgment in this situation. Vehicle #2 (2000 Dodge Durango) is not primarily responsible for the crash as the driver was traveling at a normal speed for the roadway and attempted to brake when Vehicle #1 entered the intersection. The driver of Vehicle #2 had limited visibility of Vehicle #1 due to traffic in the right lane, which may have contributed to the crash, but this does not make them primarily responsible.
