The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 encroached over the left lane line, causing the collision with V1. V2 was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to slow down or take evasive action in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, V2 locked up the brakes and steered right in an attempt to avoid the collision, indicating a lack of proper control of the vehicle. The driver of V2 also did not report any health problems or medication usage that could have impaired their ability to react to the situation.
