The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver attempted an illegal maneuver by turning left from a through lane instead of the left turn lane. The driver's inexperience, as well as the presence of multiple occupants in the bed of the truck, contributed to the vehicle's propensity to roll over. The driver's admission of jerking the wheel and accelerating just prior to the crash suggests that he may have been showing off for his friends. These factors combined led to the rollover crash.
