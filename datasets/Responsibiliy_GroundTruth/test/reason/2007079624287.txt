The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adhere to the traffic signal and did not recognize that the light was red. V1 also failed to notice that traffic in the adjacent lanes had stopped for the traffic light. This indicates a lack of adequate surveillance and failure to look or see the oncoming traffic, including V2. Additionally, V1 mentioned that they were listening to the radio while commuting home from work, which suggests a potential distraction from the task of driving. The fact that V1 had recently moved to the state and started the job four days prior may have contributed to their unfamiliarity with the intersection and traffic patterns. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Explorer SUV) was turning left at the intersection and assumed that V1 would yield the right of way. While V2's assumption may have been incorrect, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to obey the traffic signal and failing to notice the stopped traffic. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to adhere to the traffic signal, inadequate surveillance, and potential distraction.
