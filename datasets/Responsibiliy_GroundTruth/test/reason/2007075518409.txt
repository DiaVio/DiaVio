The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. The driver stated that she did not realize the turn arrow was red and proceeded into the intersection. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to properly observe the traffic signals and the presence of oncoming vehicles. While V2 (the driver of the 1994 Oldsmobile Delta 88) also had an associated factor of inadequate surveillance, it was V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle that led to the collision. V2 stated that she was proceeding through the intersection on a green light and noticed V1 when it was just "a foot away," indicating that V1's actions were unexpected and sudden. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to observe the traffic signals and the presence of oncoming traffic.
