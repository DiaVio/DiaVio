The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he had the green light and was going straight when Vehicle #2 ran the red light, causing the impact. However, the critical reason for the critical event was coded as an illegal maneuver for Vehicle #1. It was believed that the driver of Vehicle #1 ran the red light shortly after his light changed to red and was struck by Vehicle #2. The trajectory of Vehicle #1 following the impact and the damage to the vehicle also support this conclusion. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's illegal maneuver of running a red light.
