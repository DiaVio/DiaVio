The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was unable to negotiate the curve in the wet conditions and slid into the oncoming lane, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle #1. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he hydroplaned and tried to correct it but kept sliding in the rain. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was identified as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was determined to be driving too fast for the conditions. The associated factors of wet roads, rain, and tire deficiency (with low tread on the right front and right rear tires) further contribute to the responsibility of Vehicle #2 in causing the accident.
