The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was making a left turn into a private drive and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling straight in the westbound lane. The driver of V2 stated that the sun glare was in her eyes prior to making the left turn and that she was unable to see V1 approaching from the east. Additionally, the driver of V2 was unfamiliar with the road and was looking for her destination as she approached the crash scene. These factors indicate that the driver of V2 was not exercising proper caution and awareness while making the left turn, leading to the collision with V1.
