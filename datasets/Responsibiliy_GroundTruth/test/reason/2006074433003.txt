The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was internally distracted and failed to recognize that traffic was stopped ahead in the travel lane. The driver's distraction, specifically attempting to put a spilled coffee mug in the center console area, caused a recognition error and delayed the application of brakes to avoid the collision. This failure to react in a timely manner led to the rear-end collision with V2, which then caused V2 to collide with V3.
