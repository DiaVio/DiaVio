The driver of V1 made several errors that led to the loss of control of the vehicle. Firstly, the driver was having trouble seeing the pavement markings for the exit due to the rain, indicating a lack of attentiveness and awareness of the road conditions. Secondly, when the driver finally attempted to exit the highway, she braked to slow down, which caused the vehicle to skid and slide out of control. This suggests a poor decision-making process, as braking abruptly on wet roads can lead to loss of traction and control. Additionally, the driver's inexperience played a role in the accident. She had been licensed for less than a year and had limited experience with that class of vehicle. Lack of experience can contribute to poor judgment and handling of challenging driving conditions. While the heavy rains and wet roads were contributing factors, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to her decision errors, lack of attentiveness, and inexperience.
