The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. He stated that he looked left and saw a vehicle coming, then looked right and it was clear. However, he failed to look left again and recognize that Vehicle Two (V2) was approaching the intersection. This failure to properly assess the situation and recognize the presence of V2 led to the collision. Additionally, V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver recognition factor: inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly survey the intersection and recognize the approaching V2.
