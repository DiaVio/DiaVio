The reason for this is that the case vehicle (V1) was traveling south and entered the intersection with the right of way. The second vehicle (V2) was traveling west and struck the case vehicle on the left side at the left front wheel. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
