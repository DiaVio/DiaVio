The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy conditions, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and cross into the northbound lanes. Additionally, the driver did not attempt any avoidance maneuvers, indicating a lack of proactive action to prevent the accident. The driver's fatigue and failure to recognize the need for caution on the slick road surface further contribute to her responsibility for the crash.
