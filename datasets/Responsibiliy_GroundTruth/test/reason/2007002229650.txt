The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 illegally entered the oncoming traffic lane in order to pass Vehicle 2 (Chevrolet Lumina). This aggressive driving behavior of illegally passing another vehicle led to the collision between Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 refused to be interviewed and displayed a dismissive attitude towards the situation, further indicating their responsibility for the crash.
