The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes from the first lane into the second lane without adequately surveilling the area. The witness stated that V2 (the driver of the 2000 Ford Focus) was passing him on the right and changing into lane 2 prior to the intersection, indicating that V2 was already in the process of changing lanes when the collision occurred. Additionally, the witness saw the blinker of V1 on and confirmed that the driver took a look into the side mirror before changing lanes. Therefore, V1's failure to properly check for other vehicles and ensure it was safe to change lanes resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
