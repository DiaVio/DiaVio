The reason for this is that V1 lost control while negotiating a curve, resulting in the vehicle rotating clockwise and departing the roadway. V1 then rolled multiple times, impacting various objects and ultimately flipping onto its roof. The driver and front right passenger were both out of position during the rollover events, indicating that V1 was not being operated in a safe manner.
