The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2 (the 1995 Ford Windstar) which was disabled in lane one ahead of V1. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance or paying attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1's front contacted the back of V2 suggests that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2, which further supports V1's primary responsibility. It is important to note that the driver of V1 had consumed alcoholic beverages prior to the crash, but sobriety tests confirmed she was still within the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle. While the presence of alcohol was not thought to have contributed to the crash, it is still a factor to consider in terms of the driver's impairment and potential impact on their driving abilities. Overall, V1's failure to stop and collide with the disabled vehicle ahead indicates their primary responsibility for the crash.
