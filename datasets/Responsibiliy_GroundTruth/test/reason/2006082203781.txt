The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at road signs and trying to figure out where to go. This distraction caused her to not notice that the traffic in front of her had stopped, resulting in her slamming on the brakes and skidding into the back of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 is taking medication for migraines and seizures, which could potentially affect her ability to focus and react quickly in a driving situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and potential impairment from medication.
