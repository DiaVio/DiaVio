The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the critical reason coded for this driver. V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2 (the Nissan Frontier). This is supported by the fact that V1 impacted the left side of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1's estimated travel and impact speeds were only 8 kmph (5 mph), which suggests that V1 may not have been paying sufficient attention to the road and the surrounding traffic. Furthermore, it is mentioned that V1 was borrowing the vehicle from a relative and had only driven it four times prior to this trip. This lack of familiarity with the vehicle may have contributed to V1's inadequate surveillance and inability to react in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to inadequate surveillance while turning left at the intersection.
