The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is a clear violation of traffic rules. - V1 admitted to drinking while driving, indicating impaired judgment and decision-making. - V1 stated that he didn't see V2 until the collision, indicating inadequate surveillance and failure to notice the approaching vehicle. - V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway may have contributed to his failure to notice the stop sign and the presence of other vehicles. Overall, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign, impaired condition, inadequate surveillance, and unfamiliarity with the roadway make him primarily responsible for the accident.
