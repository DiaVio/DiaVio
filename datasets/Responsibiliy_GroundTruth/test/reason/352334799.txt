The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and was "cut-off" by a non-contacted vehicle encroaching into its lane from the left. As a result, the driver of Vehicle 1 steered right and departed the roadway, ultimately colliding with a traffic light support pole. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield to the encroaching vehicle and lost control, leading to the collision.
