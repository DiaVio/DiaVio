The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it first departed the roadway to the right, indicating that the driver may have lost control or made an error in judgment. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer back onto the roadway resulted in a counterclockwise rotation across both eastbound lanes, further indicating a loss of control. Finally, V1 ultimately rolled over and came to rest on its roof in the grassy median, suggesting a significant loss of control and potentially excessive speed or reckless driving.
