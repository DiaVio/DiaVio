The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way at the intersection with no traffic controls. The driver of V1 admitted to not adequately surveilling the intersection before crossing, which indicates a lack of attention and awareness while driving. This failure to yield the right of way directly led to the collision with V2 (the Ford Focus). While V2's driver was distracted by looking downward at her cell phone and being late for work, it is important to note that V2 entered the intersection after V1. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way is the primary cause of the accident.
