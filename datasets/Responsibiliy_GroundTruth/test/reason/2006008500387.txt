The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver admitted to following approximately 30 feet behind the vehicle that swerved out of the way of the deer. This close following distance would have given her very little reaction time to avoid roadway hazards, such as the deer that suddenly appeared in lane three. As a result, V1 hit the deer and then steered to the right, ultimately crashing into a cement wall.
