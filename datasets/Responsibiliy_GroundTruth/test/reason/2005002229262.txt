The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that Vehicle #1 did not stop at the intersection, but there were no stop signs or traffic control signals on either road of the intersection. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "Inadequate surveillance" because the driver failed to adequately observe the intersection before proceeding. The driver mentioned that he had driven on this roadway many times and knew there were no stop signs, but this does not excuse the lack of surveillance. Additionally, there were potential sight line limitations for Vehicle #2 due to a utility pole and parked vehicles on the right side, which may have partially blocked the driver's view of approaching traffic. However, it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure a safe crossing of the intersection. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle #1.
