The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and was impacted on the right side by the front of V2 (the 1997 Nissan Maxima). V1's inattention while crossing the intersection is identified as a driver-related factor, which suggests that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and attention while driving.
