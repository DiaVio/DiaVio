The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving erratically, crossing over several lanes, and exhibiting aggressive driving behavior. The driver's poor directional control, fatigue, and concerns about work also contributed to the collision. Additionally, V1's vehicle was the one that initially hit the rear of V2 (the 2001 Volkswagen Passat station wagon), which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3 (the 2007 Suzuki Forenza sedan).
