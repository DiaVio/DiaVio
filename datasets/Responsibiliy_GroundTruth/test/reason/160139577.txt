The reason for this is that V1 was traveling south in lane one of a two-lane, two-way roadway and for unknown reasons, it went off the roadway to the left and struck a tree with its front. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision with the tree.
