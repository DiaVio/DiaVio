The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to see V2 approaching the intersection, indicating a recognition error. This driver's lack of surveillance or possible distraction led to their failure to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the T-bone collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not have any mechanical or physical limitations that would have prevented them from seeing V2. While the driver of V2 (the Honda Accord coupe) may have contributed to the collision by hitting the gas instead of the brakes in a panic reaction, their inexperience and failure to look far enough ahead are secondary factors. The primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 for failing to recognize the approaching vehicle and yield the right of way.
