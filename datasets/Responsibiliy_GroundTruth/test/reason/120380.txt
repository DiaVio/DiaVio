The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 merged suddenly to the left and into the path of V2 (the 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer). This sudden merge caused V2 to be unable to avoid V1 and resulted in a collision between the front of V2 and the left-rear of V1. This initial collision then caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and partially enter the lane that V3 (the 2001 Chevrolet Malibu) was traveling in. As a result, V3 was unable to avoid V1 and collided with the right-rear of V1. Therefore, the sudden merge by the driver of V1 into the path of V2 is the primary cause of the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
