Reason: V1 veered off the roadway to the right and struck a cement wall, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, with the critical reason being too fast for the curve/turn. Additionally, the driver reported being fatigued from a long drive prior to the crash, suggesting that driver fatigue may have contributed to the loss of control. The fact that the driver left the scene of the crash and delayed reporting it to the police and seeking medical attention further indicates a lack of responsibility.
