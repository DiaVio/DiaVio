The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road before executing the left turn. The driver reported to the police that he did not see the approaching vehicle (V2, the 1964 Porsche 356 C) until he had already started the turn. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, V2's driver reported being aware of V1's intention to turn left and saw V1 "creeping" into his lane. V2's driver assumed that V1 would remain stopped and allow traffic to clear. This suggests that V2's driver had a false assumption, but the primary responsibility still lies with V1 for not properly observing the oncoming traffic before initiating the left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to a recognition error and inadequate surveillance, which led to the failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
