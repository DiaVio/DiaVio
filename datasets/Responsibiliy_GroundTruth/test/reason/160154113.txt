The reason for this is that V1 was traveling east and entered a left-hand curve in the roadway. However, V1 ran off the roadway to the right and struck a tree head-on, resulting in the crash. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to negotiate the curve properly and lost control of the vehicle, leading to the collision.
