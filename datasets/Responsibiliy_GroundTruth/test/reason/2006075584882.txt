The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road. The driver admitted to looking at the dash to push a button on the CD player when the crash occurred. This internal distraction caused V1 to fail to notice that V2 had stopped in front of them to make a left turn. V1 did not attempt any evasive maneuvers to avoid the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Escape) was stopped in the lane to make a left turn and had correctly assessed the situation by looking in the rearview mirror and anticipating that V1 was not going to stop. V2 even released the brake to cushion the impact, considering the fact that she was eight weeks pregnant and didn't want the airbags to go off. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to stop in time make them primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
