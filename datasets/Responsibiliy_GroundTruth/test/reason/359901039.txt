The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control on the icy roadway, resulting in a clockwise rotation and ultimately sliding into the ditch bordering the on-ramp. V1's entire undercarriage and left sill area made contact with the opposite side of the ditch, indicating that V1 was not able to maintain control and avoid leaving the roadway.
