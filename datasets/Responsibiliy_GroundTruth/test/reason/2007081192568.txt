The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle when encountering an animal in the roadway. The driver's incorrect evasive action, overcompensation, and poor directional control led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with the ditch and trees. Additionally, the driver's admission of being late and potentially being distracted by the medication she was taking for depression may have contributed to her inability to react appropriately to the situation.
