The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that she looked both ways but couldn't see to her left due to a large sign obstructing her view. Despite this obstruction, she proceeded to turn left and collided with V2 (the 2005 Toyota Tundra pick-up) traveling in the northbound lane. V1's failure to take appropriate avoidance actions and the fact that she was traveling at a speed of less than 10 MPH at the time of impact further support her primary responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, V2 was driving within the posted speed limit and had the right of way while traveling straight in the northbound lane. The driver of V2 stated that he saw V1 turn in front of him but did not have time to take any avoidance actions. Therefore, based on the given information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to adequately survey the intersection and make a safe left turn.
