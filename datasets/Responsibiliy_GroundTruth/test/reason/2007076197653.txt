The reason for this is that V1 drove off the right side of the roadway and then made a u-turn, entering the roadway again. This action created a hazardous situation for other vehicles, including V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Alero), who was unable to avoid the collision. V1's decision to make a u-turn on a straight, level, undivided roadway without proper signaling or ensuring it was safe to do so demonstrates a lack of caution and disregard for other drivers on the road. Additionally, the fact that V1 had been working on the trailer brake lights suggests a potential distraction or lack of attention to the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their unsafe maneuver and failure to exercise proper care while operating their vehicle.
