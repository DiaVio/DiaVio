The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking over her right shoulder to change lanes, which took her attention off the traffic ahead of her. This distraction likely caused her to fail to notice that V2 was stopped in front of her, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of V1 was 32 kmph, indicating that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or traveling at an appropriate speed for the congested traffic conditions. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
