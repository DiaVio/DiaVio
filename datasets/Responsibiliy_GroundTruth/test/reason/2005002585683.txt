The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was making a left turn and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that she never saw Vehicle #2 until it was too late to avoid the crash. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of Vehicle #1. Additionally, Vehicle #1 stated that she had just accelerated from a stop and was traveling at a low speed of 5-10 MPH, while Vehicle #2 was described as traveling pretty fast. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
