The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection during a steady green light, which indicates that V1 had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V2 (the Jeep) was traveling straight through the intersection with a steady green light, and V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, V1 continued to travel south after the initial impact and struck V3 (the Ford Expedition), further indicating that V1 was not in control of the vehicle and failed to properly navigate the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and inability to control the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
