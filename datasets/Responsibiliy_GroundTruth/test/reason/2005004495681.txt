The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that they looked right then left, but did not see the other vehicle (V2) approaching from the eastbound lane. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to V1 pulling out in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a very low speed (between 1-10 MPH) at the time of impact, while V2 was traveling within the posted speed limit (between 41-50 MPH). This further indicates that V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic was a significant contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
