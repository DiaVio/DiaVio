The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection, which is evident from the associated factors of crossed with view obstructed, sight-line restriction, and conversing with the passenger. These factors contributed to the driver's failure to see V1 approaching the intersection. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V2 had not been on this roadway before, which may have further contributed to her lack of familiarity with the intersection and potential hazards. On the other hand, the driver of V1, although unlicensed and driving without proper authorization, stated that he could not see V2 due to a white van parked at the intersection. While this may have obstructed his view, it does not absolve V2 of their responsibility to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to exercise proper surveillance and awareness of the intersection.
