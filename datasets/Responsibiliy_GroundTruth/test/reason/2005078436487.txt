The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to unintentionally pushing the gas pedal instead of the brake, causing their vehicle to continue forward and collide with the rear of V2 (the 1996 Geo Metro). This initial impact then forced V2 to collide with the rear of V3 (the 1996 Ford F-150 pick-up truck). Therefore, the driver of V1's error in vehicle control and failure to stop properly is the main cause of the crash.
