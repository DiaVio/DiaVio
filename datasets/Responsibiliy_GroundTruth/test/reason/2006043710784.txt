The reason for VI's primary responsibility is that the driver of VI was distracted by looking at kids walking on the sidewalk and possibly talking on her cell phone. This external distraction caused her to collide with the rear of Vehicle Two (V2), the Ford Taurus, which had come to a sudden stop due to heavy lunch hour traffic. VI's failure to maintain proper attention to the road and the traffic ahead resulted in the collision. Additionally, VI's vehicle had low tread depth on all four tires, which could have contributed to reduced braking efficiency and increased stopping distance. However, this factor alone does not absolve VI of responsibility for the accident. In contrast, V2 was stopped for 3-4 seconds prior to the impact and the driver of V2 was aware of VI approaching from behind. Although the driver of V2 was talking on her cell phone, she took appropriate action by bracing the wheel, holding the brake, and preparing for impact. V2's minor damage and the fact that it was driveable after the accident further suggest that V2 was not primarily responsible for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, VI is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road and traffic conditions.
