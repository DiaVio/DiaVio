The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection while the traffic signal was red, indicating that V2 did not have the right-of-way. V2 claimed to have a green light, but this contradicts the statement from V1, who reported that the signal had entered the red phase. Additionally, V2 did not report being aware of V1 prior to entering the intersection, indicating a lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
