The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a blowout/tire failure. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation and failure to regain control of the vehicle contributed to the accident. The shifting cargo in the truck also played a role in inducing the rollover.
