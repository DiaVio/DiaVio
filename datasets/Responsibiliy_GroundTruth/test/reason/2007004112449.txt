The driver of V1 admitted to not stopping at the stop sign and proceeding through the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. This is supported by the coding of "Inadequate surveillance - looked but did not see" as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1. Additionally, V1 was also engaged in an illegal maneuver by failing to stop for the traffic control device (the stop sign). The wet roads and cloudy/rainy weather conditions may have contributed to the accident, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not stopping at the stop sign and failing to properly observe the intersection before proceeding.
