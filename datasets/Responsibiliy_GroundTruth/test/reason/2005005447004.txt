The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 went through a red light at the intersection and contacted the front left side of Vehicle 2 (1998 Ford Taurus), which was crossing the intersection with a green light. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way and violated the traffic signal, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that Vehicle 1 was traveling at a higher speed (72kph or 45mph) compared to Vehicle 2 (approximately 20mph), which further suggests that Vehicle 1 was not able to stop in time or avoid the collision. Furthermore, the fact that the driver of Vehicle 1 refused to cooperate with the investigation and the suspicion that she was on prescription medication for depression raises concerns about her ability to operate the vehicle safely. While it is unknown if the medication directly contributed to the crash, it is important to consider the potential impact of impaired judgment or reaction time. In contrast, Vehicle 2 was following the traffic signal and had the right of way when it was struck by Vehicle 1. The occupants of Vehicle 2 also claimed that they did not see Vehicle 1 coming, indicating that they were not at fault for the collision. Overall, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to running a red light and failing to yield the right of way.
