The reason for this is poor directional control, which was a driver performance error. The driver of V1 stated that he was passing a car and when he attempted to pull back into his lane, he hit the gravel on the side of the shoulder of the road. This caused his car to fishtail, resulting in a 360-degree spin and ultimately hitting the guardrail. Additionally, the driver's age (85 years old) and the fact that he was using prescription medications for medical conditions (diabetes, heart condition, and hypertension) may have contributed to his poor directional control and inability to safely maneuver the vehicle.
