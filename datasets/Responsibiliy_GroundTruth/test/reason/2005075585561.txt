The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by two skiers who she thought were about to step out into the roadway. This distraction caused her to fail to notice the stopped traffic ahead and she was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision with the back of V2 (the silver 1999 Chevrolet Blazer compact SUV). The impact then pushed V2 forward, causing it to collide with the back of V3 (the white 1993 Mitsubishi Diamante 4 door).
