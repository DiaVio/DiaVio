The reason for this is that V2 drifted into the lane to her left, which caused her to strike V1 (the Kenworth tractor). This action of drifting into another lane indicates a lack of attention and focus on the part of V2, as stated in the Critical Reason for the Critical Event. This inattention led to the collision and subsequent loss of control of V2's vehicle. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain her lane and her inattention are the primary factors that led to the accident.
