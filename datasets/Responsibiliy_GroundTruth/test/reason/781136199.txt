The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was not using the available lap and shoulder belts, which are a crucial safety measure in vehicles. The physical evidence indicates that the driver was not wearing the seatbelt at the time of the accident. This failure to use the seatbelt contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the driver and potentially affected their ability to control the vehicle during the collision.
