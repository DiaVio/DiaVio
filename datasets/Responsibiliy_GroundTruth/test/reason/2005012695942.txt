The driver of V1 made a left-hand turn at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. Despite the obstructed view caused by another vehicle in the opposing lane, the driver of V1 proceeded with the turn. This decision error led to the collision with V2, which was traveling straight through the intersection. While the driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by locking up his brakes, the critical reason for the accident was the driver of V1's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's decision to turn with an obstructed view.
