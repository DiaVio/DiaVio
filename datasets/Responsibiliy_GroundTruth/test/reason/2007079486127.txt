The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the accelerator became stuck, causing the vehicle to accelerate to a high speed of 129 kmph (80 mph). The driver's attempt to brake resulted in the vehicle fish tailing and losing control. The driver's subsequent actions, such as steering to the right and departing the roadway, ultimately led to the vehicle rolling over and catching fire. Therefore, V1's primary responsibility lies in the vehicle-related factor of transmission/engine failure due to the stuck accelerator, which directly contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
