The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 collided with the back of V2 (1998 Nissan Maxima) while it was stopped in lane one. This suggests that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This further implies that the driver of V1 made an error that contributed to the crash, although the specific details of the error are unknown. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and their involvement in the initial collision with V2.
