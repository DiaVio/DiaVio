The driver of V1 attempted to change lanes without slowing down or stopping for V2 (the 1995 Ford Escort wagon) which was already slowing down behind V3 (the 1991 Chevrolet box truck). This indicates a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the other vehicles by the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption that the other driver would continue to proceed.
