The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 (the Plymouth Sundance) while crossing the intersection. Additionally, V2's inadequate surveillance was an associated factor in the crash, suggesting that the driver did not properly observe the oncoming traffic before proceeding.
