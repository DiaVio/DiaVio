The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection from the far left lane, which indicates that V1 was crossing the path of oncoming traffic. As a result, the front of V2, the 2003 Toyota Camry, contacted the left side of V1, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2.
