The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event identified for V1, which states that the driver of V1 was crossing over and passing through the intersection. The driver of V1 failed to properly look or see V2 approaching from the westbound lanes, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there were several associated factors that contributed to V1's responsibility. These factors include the sightline restriction caused by the bridge, the distraction from the vehicle trying to get into V1's lane, the adverse weather conditions (rain), and the wet roadway. While these factors may have influenced the driver's ability to see and react to V2, the primary responsibility still lies with V1 for not adequately surveilling the intersection before proceeding.
