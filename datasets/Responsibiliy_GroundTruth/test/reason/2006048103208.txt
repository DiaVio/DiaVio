The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding forward, even though another motorist waved him to go. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2 (the 2000 Ford Explorer) and subsequently caused V3 (the 2003 Pontiac Grand Prix) to be involved in the crash as well.
