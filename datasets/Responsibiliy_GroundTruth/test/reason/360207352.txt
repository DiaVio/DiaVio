The reason for this is that V1 departed off the roadway and struck multiple objects, including a small tree, a playground structure, and the ground. V1 also swiped a small tree before coming to a final rest in a driveway. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper control, resulting in the accident.
