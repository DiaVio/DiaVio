The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the severe impact with the utility pole and the subsequent rotation of the vehicle indicate that V1 was the vehicle that directly collided with the pole. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the driver, including the intra-cerebral hemorrhage, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, basilar skull fracture, and other injuries, suggest that the driver was directly involved in the impact and rotation of V1. It is important to note that without further information or investigation, it is not possible to determine the exact cause or circumstances leading to the accident.
