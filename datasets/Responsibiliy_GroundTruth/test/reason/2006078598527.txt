The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 121 kmph (75 mph), which is the maximum allowed speed on the road. - The driver of V1 heard and felt the right rear tire blow out, which caused the vehicle to swerve and lose control. - The driver's actions, such as steering left and touching the brakes, contributed to the vehicle entering a counterclockwise rotation and ultimately overturning. - The fact that V1 was carrying a significant amount of cargo (560 kilograms or 1,500 lbs) may have affected the vehicle's stability and handling during the incident. - Additionally, two occupants in the rear of V1 were riding without restraints, which is a violation of safety regulations and contributed to their ejection during the rollover. Overall, V1's primary responsibility can be attributed to factors such as the blowout of the right rear tire, the driver's response to the situation, and the presence of unrestrained occupants in the vehicle.
