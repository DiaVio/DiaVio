The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, who is a paraplegic, lost control of the vehicle while making a left turn. The driver's loose screw-on knob on the steering wheel contributed to the loss of control. Despite being familiar with the vehicle and driving the route daily, the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and allowed it to veer off the road, crash through a fence, and go over a retaining wall into a parking lot. The driver could have braked the vehicle to a controlled stop prior to impact, but failed to do so.
