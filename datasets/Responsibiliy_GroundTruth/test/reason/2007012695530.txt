The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop for the blinking red light at the intersection. Additionally, V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Suburban) and thought that V2 would stop, leading to the collision. V1's failure to yield the right-of-way and her false assumption of V2's actions contributed to the accident.
