The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a speed that was too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver of V2 realized too late that V1 was stopped and was unable to brake or steer in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver's view of V1 was blocked by an intervening vehicle, which further contributed to the inability to react in time. The presence of sun glare and a slightly dirty windshield were considered factors in this crash, but ultimately, it was the driver's failure to adjust their speed and react appropriately that led to the collision.
