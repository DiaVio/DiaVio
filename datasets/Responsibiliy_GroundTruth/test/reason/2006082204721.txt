The reason for this is that V1 initiated a U-turn from the parking lane into the travel lane without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that he looked for traffic before pulling out, but it is likely that the parked vehicles behind his car and the right road curvature obstructed his view of V2 approaching. This inadequate surveillance led to V1 entering the travel lane and colliding with V2. V2 (the driver of the white Subaru Impreza) attempted to avoid the collision by changing lanes to the left and braking, but there was no way to completely avoid it. Both witnesses listed on the police report also stated that V1 pulled out in front of V2, further supporting V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
