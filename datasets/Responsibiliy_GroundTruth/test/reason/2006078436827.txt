The reason for this is that V1 traveled to the west side of the roadway and struck the rear of V2 (the parked 1984 Chevrolet Â½ ton pickup). This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle and failed to avoid colliding with the parked vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V1 was apparently under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash, which could have impaired their judgment and ability to operate the vehicle safely. The fact that V1 was also reported as stolen further suggests that the driver may have been engaging in illegal activities, which could have contributed to the crash.
