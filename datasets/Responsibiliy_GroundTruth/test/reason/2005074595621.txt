The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 80 kmph (50 mph) in wet conditions, which was too fast for the curve. This resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately the collision with a tree. The driver's aggressive driving, inexperience, poor directional control, and personal problems also contributed to the accident.
