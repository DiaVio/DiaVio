The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, intending to continue traveling southbound. However, it collided with Vehicle 2 (the 2008 International Model 4300 heavy/medium truck) which was traveling north and crossing through the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
