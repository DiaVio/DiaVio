The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. Both the driver's statement to the investigating officer and the researcher's observation of dirty windows suggest that V1 did not have a clear view of the intersection. Additionally, the driver's statement at the hospital, "where did the other vehicle come from I never saw it," further supports the conclusion that V1 did not see V2 before the collision occurred. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1994 Ford Explorer) entered the intersection on a green light and did not report any contributing factors that would make her primarily responsible for the collision. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be the critical reason for the collision.
