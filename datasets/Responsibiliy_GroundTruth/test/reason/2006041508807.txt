The reason for V1's responsibility is that it attempted to make a lane change into lane two without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This resulted in the right side of V1's trailer striking the left rear corner of V2. Despite V3's attempt to avoid V1 by swerving left, V1 continued its lane change and the front left corner of V1 struck the right front corner of V3. This impact forced V3 off the roadway and into the concrete barrier wall, causing severe damage. Therefore, V1's failure to properly execute a lane change and causing subsequent collisions with V2 and V3 makes it primarily responsible for the crash.
