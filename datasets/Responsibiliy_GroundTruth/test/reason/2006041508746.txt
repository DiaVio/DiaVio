The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right-of-way at the intersection. V1 came to a complete stop at the stop sign, but then proceeded into the intersection without properly assessing the situation. The driver of V1 was distracted by something inside the vehicle, which led to a recognition error and prevented them from noticing V2 approaching. This driver-related error resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
