The driver of V1 was arrested at the scene for DWI and had a high BAC level of 0.27. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V1 was inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver failed to look far enough ahead. This suggests that V1 was not paying attention to the road and did not notice V2 in the center turn lane. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and failure to properly observe the road make them primarily responsible for the collision.
