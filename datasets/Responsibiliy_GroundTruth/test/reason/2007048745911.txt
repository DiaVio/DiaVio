The driver of V1 was traveling over the center line and then abruptly steered right, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," and the critical reason for this event was determined to be "driver related factor; too fast for curve/turn." These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was driving too fast for the curve, resulting in the loss of control and the subsequent rollover accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
