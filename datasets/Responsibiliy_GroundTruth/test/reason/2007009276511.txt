The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection against the traffic control device, failing to stop for a red light. The driver of V1 also failed to adequately surveil the intersection, as indicated by the associated factor of inadequate surveillance. This failure to look far enough ahead and to the side resulted in V1 colliding with V2, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way.
