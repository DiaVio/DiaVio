The reason for this is that V1 continued into the intersection without yielding to the vehicles making left turns, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2 (V2) and Vehicle 3 (V3). V1's impact with V2 and V3 caused significant damage and resulted in serious injuries to the driver and minor injuries to the front right passenger of V1.
