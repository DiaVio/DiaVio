The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that it drifted to the left, crossed the center-turn lane, and entered the inside northbound lane, ultimately colliding with Vehicle one (V1). This indicates that V2 was not in its designated lane and failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the collision.
