The reason for V1's responsibility is that the tread on the right rear tire separated from the tire, causing a blowout/flat tire. This resulted in V1 losing control of the vehicle and ultimately causing the accident. The fact that the tread on the left rear tire was also missing and deflated suggests that there may have been issues with the maintenance and condition of the tires on V1, further contributing to the responsibility of the driver.
