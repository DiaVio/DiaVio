The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention for a second, which indicates a lack of focus and negligence on their part. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only been driving unsupervised for 2 months, suggesting a lack of experience and potentially inadequate training. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 Mercury Villager) was stopped at the traffic light in lane two and was starting from the green light, indicating that they were following the traffic rules and proceeding lawfully. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly surveil the intersection and their admitted lack of attention while driving.
