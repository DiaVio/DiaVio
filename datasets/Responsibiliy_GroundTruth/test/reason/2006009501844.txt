The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 57-year-old male with a history of hypoglycemia and diabetes, stated that he was feeling fatigued and sleepy from a prior workout at the gym. He further mentioned that he had lost consciousness and did not recall the crash sequence. The critical reason for the crash was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically, other critical non-performance due to the driver's loss of consciousness caused by hypoglycemia. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's medical condition and resulting loss of consciousness.
