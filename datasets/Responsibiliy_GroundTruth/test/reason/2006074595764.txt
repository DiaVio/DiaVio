The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling northbound in lane one and failed to stop for the traffic signal at the intersection. - The driver of V1 was distracted and "overwhelmed" by school and work, thinking about work at the time of the crash. - V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "driver related factor; inattention (i.e., daydreaming)" and an associated factor was a failure to look far enough ahead. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for the traffic signal and the driver's inattention and distraction make them primarily responsible for the accident.
