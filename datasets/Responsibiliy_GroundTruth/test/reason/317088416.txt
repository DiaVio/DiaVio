The reason for this is that V1 crossed the center line and struck the left side of V2 (the 2002 Kia Spectra 4 door sedan). This indicates that V1 was not in its designated lane and failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle, resulting in the sideswipe impact. Additionally, V1 continued southbound and departed the left side of the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree stump and rolling over. These actions suggest a lack of control and negligence on the part of the driver of V1.
