The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing the railroad tracks. The driver admitted to not stopping at the tracks and stated that he did not see the train until it was too late. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the road and was conversing with the passenger, which likely distracted him from properly assessing the situation. The sight line restriction caused by the excess vegetation bordering the tracks also contributed to the driver's inability to see the oncoming train. While the train operator mentioned limited sight distance as a contributing factor, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to cross the tracks. In this case, Vehicle #1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to yield to the oncoming train, resulting in the collision.
