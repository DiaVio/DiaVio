The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep while driving, which was the critical reason for the crash. The driver had been working extended hours, had only slept for a total of 4 hours in the past 24 hours, and had even taken two 15-minute naps during the day. This level of fatigue significantly impaired the driver's ability to stay alert and in control of the vehicle, leading to the vehicle running off the roadway and colliding with the exit sign and guardrail.
