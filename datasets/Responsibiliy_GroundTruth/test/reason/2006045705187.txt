The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver tested positive for several drugs, both legal and illegal, which are believed to have inhibited their performance. This impaired state likely contributed to the driver's failure to stay in their lane and cross into the right turn only lane, ultimately resulting in the collision with the guardrail.
