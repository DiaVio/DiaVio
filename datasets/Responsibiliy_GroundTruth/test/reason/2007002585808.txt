The reason for this is that V1 lost control on the snow/slush-covered roadway, indicating that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. This is supported by the fact that the roadway had a warning sign and a suggested speed of 40 kmph (25 mph) for the curve, but V1 was unable to negotiate the curve safely. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event and Critical Reason both indicate that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions.
