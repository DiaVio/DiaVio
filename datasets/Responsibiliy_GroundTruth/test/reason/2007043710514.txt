The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without properly checking for oncoming traffic. V2's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V1 approaching from the northbound lanes led to the collision. Additionally, V2 made an illegal maneuver by not stopping at the stop sign, which further contributed to the accident.
