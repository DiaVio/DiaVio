The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that it made a right turn across the path of the case vehicle (V1), causing the collision. V1, the case vehicle, attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering left, but was unable to prevent the impact. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe turn resulted in the accident.
