The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed between 50-64 kmph (31-40 mph), which may have been too fast for the road conditions and the driver's level of experience. - The driver of V1 attempted to avoid a litter of puppies on the roadway by applying the brakes and steering left. However, the driver stated that the steering wheel and brakes locked up, preventing him from steering effectively. - The driver's incorrect evasive action, combined with traveling too fast and inexperience with the vehicle, contributed to V1 departing the roadway and colliding with a tree. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver of V1 did not have a driver's license and tested positive for THC, indicating the presence of marijuana in his system. These factors further suggest a lack of experience and impaired judgment, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to handle the situation appropriately. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's errors in evasive action, excessive speed, inexperience, and potential impairment.
