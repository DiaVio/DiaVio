The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it crossed the center line, drove off the left edge of the road, and collided with multiple trees before finally impacting a tree with its left-front end. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the accident.
