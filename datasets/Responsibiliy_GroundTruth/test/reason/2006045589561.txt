The reason for this is that V1, the Chevrolet pickup, was traveling behind V2, the GMC pickup, and failed to maintain control of their vehicle. V1 attempted to change lanes to the right to avoid slowing down but was unable to do so due to the presence of other vehicles in the right lane. Instead of immediately decelerating, V1 continued in the left lane and rear-ended V2, who was stopped and waiting to turn left onto the side street. The driver of V1 was charged with DUI, failure to maintain control, and driving on a revoked license, indicating that their impaired state and lack of control over their vehicle contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 had insufficient braking inputs, further suggesting their failure to take appropriate evasive action. On the other hand, V2, the GMC pickup, was not found to have contributed to the crash. The driver of V2 was stopped and waiting to turn left for a significant amount of time before the collision occurred. They were not aware of the approaching V1 from behind and did not have any associated factors coded to their vehicle.
