The reason for this is that the driver of V2 drove through a standing puddle of water, causing the vehicle to hydroplane and lose control. This resulted in V2 crossing the centerline and entering the westbound lane, where it was struck by V1. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V2 directly led to the accident.
