The reason for this is that V1, driven by an 83-year old female, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She admitted to not seeing V2 approaching her vehicle until after she had already started to turn. This indicates a lack of proper observation and judgment on the part of V1. Additionally, V1's statement that she was unsure of the traffic signal color further suggests a lack of attention and awareness while driving. While V2 did have a false assumption that V1 would yield the right of way, V2 had the right of way as she had a green light. V2 also attempted to brake to avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time. Therefore, V2's actions can be seen as a reaction to V1's failure to yield and not the primary cause of the accident. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
