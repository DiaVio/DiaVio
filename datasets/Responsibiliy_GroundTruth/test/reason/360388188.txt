The reason for this is that V1 was traveling down the private driveway leading to the parking garage and failed to negotiate the curve properly. As a result, V1's front impacted the gate, knocking it from its original location, and then continued forward to impact the garage wall. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and was unable to navigate the curve safely, leading to the subsequent impacts.
