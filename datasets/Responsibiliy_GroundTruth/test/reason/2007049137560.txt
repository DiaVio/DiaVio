The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 did not detect V2 (the Chevrolet pick-up) and did not take any evasive action. Additionally, V1 did not stop prior to making the left turn, even though the traffic light had just turned yellow. This indicates a failure to exercise caution and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
