The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle, a 15-year-old male, lost control of the vehicle while traveling on a two-lane rural paved road. The driver overcorrected after the vehicle departed the road, causing it to rotate and eventually collide with a tree. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and the subsequent actions leading to the collision indicate that the primary responsibility lies with the case vehicle.
