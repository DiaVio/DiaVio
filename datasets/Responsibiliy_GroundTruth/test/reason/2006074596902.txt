The reason for this is that Vehicle two was turning right into a convenience store parking lot and failed to properly judge the gap or speed of Vehicle one, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle two admitted to having bad vision and barely passing the driver's license vision test, which could have contributed to the misjudgment. However, it is important to note that the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was not coded, so there may have been some contributing factors on their part as well.
