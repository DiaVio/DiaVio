The reason for this is that V2 was passing over taking vehicles, which indicates that it was attempting to overtake other vehicles in an unsafe manner. Additionally, V2 impacted the front left corner of V1, indicating that V2 was in the wrong lane at the time of the collision. The post-impact rotation and subsequent collision with various objects further suggest that V2 was not in control of the vehicle. Therefore, V2's actions of unsafe passing and being in the wrong lane make it primarily responsible for the accident.
