The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and impacted the right side of V2 (the 1997 BMW 318i). Witnesses reported that the driver of V1 was driving erratically prior to entering the intersection, and the driver of V1 stated that she blacked out and had no recollection of the events leading to the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "passing through intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor-heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act." On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that the light was green and she did not detect V1 prior to impact. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment - from crossing street, across path" and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's physical impairment and erratic driving behavior.
