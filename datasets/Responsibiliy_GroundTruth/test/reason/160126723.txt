The reason for this is that V2's front contacted the right side of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield or properly navigate through the intersection. Additionally, both vehicles skidded clockwise after the impact, suggesting that V2 may have been traveling at a higher speed or failed to properly control their vehicle. However, it is important to note that a more thorough investigation may be required to determine the exact factors contributing to the accident and to assign final responsibility.
