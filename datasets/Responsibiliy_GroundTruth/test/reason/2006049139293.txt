The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to react to the actions of V2 (the 1996 Chevrolet S-10 driven by a 54-year-old male) who was making a right turn at the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which resulted in the collision.
