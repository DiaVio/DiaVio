The driver of V1 was attempting to pass a slower vehicle in front of him and made multiple lane changes in a rapid and frequent manner. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, led to the loss of control of the vehicle. V1 skidded, hit a light pole, and then collided with V2 (the Ford Crown Victoria). V2, on the other hand, was stopped at the intersection for the traffic control signal and was not involved in the first harmful event. Therefore, no critical pre-crash event or critical reason was coded to the driver of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's aggressive and unsafe driving behavior, including excessive speed and rapid lane changes.
