The reason for this is that V1 entered the T-intersection in an attempt to execute a left turn, crossing the path of Vehicle #2 (V2), the 2006 Ford F150 Extended cab pickup. V2 had the right of way as it was traveling straight in the northbound lane. V1 failed to yield to V2, resulting in the collision.
