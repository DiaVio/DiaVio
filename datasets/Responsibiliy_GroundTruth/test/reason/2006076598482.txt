The reason for Vehicle One's primary responsibility is that the driver departed their travel lane and the roadway while attempting to avoid a deer crossing the road. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of their vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the subsequent impacts with a rock, a fence, and a tree. The driver's inability to avoid the deer and their subsequent loss of control suggests a lack of attentiveness or proper reaction to the situation, making them primarily responsible for the crash.
