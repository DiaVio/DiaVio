The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that it attempted to change lanes to the left and made contact with the right side of Vehicle #2 (the 1999 Land Rover Discovery wagon). This initial contact caused Vehicle #1 to continue crossing into the oncoming lanes and collide head-on with Vehicle #3 (the 2000 Chrysler Voyager). The subsequent impact with Vehicle #3 caused both vehicles to rotate and come to rest in different positions. Additionally, Vehicle #1 was charged with no driver's license and no insurance, indicating a violation of traffic laws and regulations. Therefore, Vehicle #1's actions of attempting to change lanes without proper clearance and causing the subsequent head-on collision make it primarily responsible for the crash.
