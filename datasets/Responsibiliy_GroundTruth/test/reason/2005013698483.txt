The driver of V1 stated that they stopped, looked both ways, and did not see any vehicle coming before proceeding to cross the road. However, they admitted to seeing the other vehicle (V2) at the last second but it was too late to avoid the impact. This indicates a recognition error on the part of the driver of V1, as they failed to properly perceive the presence of V2 before crossing the intersection. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1998 Ford Taurus) stated that they saw V1 stopped at the stop sign and believed that V1 would not pull out in front of them. They also mentioned that V1 tried to cross in front of them at the last moment, and although they steered to the right and hit the brakes, there wasn't enough time to avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to recognize the presence of V2 and yield the right of way makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
