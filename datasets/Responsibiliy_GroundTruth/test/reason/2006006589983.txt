The driver of Vehicle one was found to have committed an illegal maneuver by running the signalized traffic device on the wrong signal, specifically failing to stop at a controlled traffic device. This indicates that Vehicle one disregarded the traffic signal and entered the intersection when it was not their right of way. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two (2001 Ford Crown Victoria) stated that they were driving southbound and began to pass through the intersection when they were struck by Vehicle one. They claimed to have steered right in an attempt to avoid the crash, but were unable to do so due to the excessive speed of Vehicle one. The driver of Vehicle two also mentioned that the traffic light had been green for several seconds prior to their approach. However, without any witnesses on the scene to confirm the sequence of events or the status of the traffic signal, it is difficult to determine the exact timing and actions of both drivers. Nevertheless, based on the evidence provided, the illegal maneuver of Vehicle one and their failure to stop at the controlled traffic device make them primarily responsible for the accident.
