The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 turned left at the intersection without ensuring that both lanes were clear. Although a non-contact vehicle stopped and waved for V1 to make the turn, V1 had difficulty seeing over the non-contact vehicle due to the height difference. Despite this, V1 proceeded to turn and collided with V2, who was traveling straight in lane one. V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling - turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was coded as "turned with obstructed view." These factors indicate that V1's decision to turn without a clear view of the oncoming traffic was a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to ensure a safe left turn at the intersection.
