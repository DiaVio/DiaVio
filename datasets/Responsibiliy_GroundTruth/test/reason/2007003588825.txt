The driver of V2 stated that she was traveling through the intersection with a green light, indicating that she had the right of way. However, the critical reason for the accident was coded as inadequate surveillance, suggesting that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe the intersection and did not see the approaching emergency vehicle, V1. Additionally, the witness, a crossing guard, stated that V1 had the red light, further supporting the conclusion that V2 failed to yield to the emergency vehicle.
