The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the oncoming vehicle that was losing control and crossing into V1's lane. Instead of being able to safely avoid the vehicle, V1's driver applied the brakes and steered right, causing V1 to rotate clockwise and ultimately roll off the roadway. While the driver of V1 may have taken evasive action, the fact that V1 began to rotate and ultimately rolled off the roadway suggests that the speed at which V1 was traveling was not appropriate for the road conditions (ice-covered, uphill roadway) and the presence of an oncoming vehicle losing control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to driving too fast for the conditions and being unable to respond effectively to the unexpected actions of the other vehicle.
