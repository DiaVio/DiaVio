The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 stopped ahead of him until two seconds before impact. This indicates inadequate surveillance and a failure to look far enough ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported skidding and being unable to brake in time to avoid the collision. These factors suggest that V1's driver was not paying sufficient attention to the road and failed to react appropriately to the situation.
