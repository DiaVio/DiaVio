The reason for this is that V2 failed to ensure that all traffic had stopped before entering the roadway. This is evident from the fact that V1 driver saw V2 stopped in the private business drive, but did not expect V2 to enter the roadway in front of her. V2's inadequate surveillance, specifically failing to look or looking but not seeing, led to the collision.
