The driver of V1 was distracted by holding her cell phone and talking while driving, which caused her to enter the intersection on a red light. This distraction led to a failure in recognizing the traffic controls and the presence of V2 (the 1998 Chevrolet Venture). Additionally, V1's inadequate surveillance contributed to the collision.
