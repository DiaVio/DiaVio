The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by attempting to make a right turn from the left turn lane. This decision error was due to inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to recognize the approaching traffic (V2) due to a sightline restriction caused by a large truck blocking their view. Additionally, it is strongly believed that the driver was distracted by talking on a cell phone at the time of the crash. While V2 (the Ford Focus) did have an associated factor of a decision error in assuming that V1 would yield the right-of-way, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an improper turn and failing to properly observe the oncoming traffic.
