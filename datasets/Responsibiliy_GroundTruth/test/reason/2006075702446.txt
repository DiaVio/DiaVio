The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, who was using the cruise control that she was not familiar with, traveled off the side of the road for no apparent reason and made no apparent attempts to avoid the crash. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." This suggests that the driver's unfamiliarity with the cruise control and potential driver error contributed to the crash.
