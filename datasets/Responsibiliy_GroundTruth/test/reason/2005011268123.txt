The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced, unlicensed, and not familiar with both the vehicle and the roadway. The driver's actions after the vehicle began to skid, such as tapping lightly on the brakes and steering in the wrong direction, also contributed to the accident. The distraction caused by conversation and the poor condition of the roadway were additional factors that played a role in the crash.
