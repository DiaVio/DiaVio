The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was daydreaming and not paying attention to the roadway. This lack of attention caused her to be unable to react fast enough to avoid the collision with V2 (the 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee). Additionally, the driver's inattention could be attributed to the small amount of sleep she had received the previous night. Associated factors such as failing to look far enough ahead, following too closely, and the presence of a roadway construction zone also contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
