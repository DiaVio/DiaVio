The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that the non-contact vehicle (the 1991 Nissan Maxima) entered the intersection in front of her, causing her to swerve to the right and apply the brakes. However, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, indicating that V1 veered off the road before the collision with the iron fence. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event was coded as a driver-related factor: poor directional control due to insufficient steering and braking. The driver's fear of braking hard because of her daughter in the rear seat may have contributed to her inability to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the coding of the critical pre-crash event and critical reason, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
