The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize that traffic was stopped ahead of her and did not adequately surveil the road ahead. This is evident from the fact that V1 impacted the back of V2, indicating a failure to maintain a safe following distance and pay attention to the road conditions. The critical reason for the event, as attributed to V1, was inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and maintain a safe following distance led to the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
