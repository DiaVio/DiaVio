The reason for this is that V2 lost control for unknown reasons, traveled partially off the right side of the road, and then returned to the roadway, crossing into the oncoming lane of travel. This encroachment into the oncoming lane ultimately resulted in the collision with V1. Additionally, the investigating police officer estimated V2's travel speed to be 56 kmph (35 mph), which suggests that V2 may have been traveling too fast for the road conditions, considering the dark and rainy conditions with wet roadways. It is important to note that V1 attempted to avoid the collision by honking the horn, braking, and steering to the right, but was unable to do so. V1's estimated speed at impact was 32 kmph (20 mph), which indicates that V1 was likely traveling at or below the posted speed limit of 35 mph. Overall, V2's loss of control, encroachment into the oncoming lane, and potentially excessive speed in adverse weather conditions make them primarily responsible for the crash.
