The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to negotiate the right turn and ran off the right roadside just prior to the intersection. This resulted in V1 colliding with a metal utility pole in an extreme left-offset manner. The impact caused significant damage to V1 and caused the driver to sustain serious injuries.
