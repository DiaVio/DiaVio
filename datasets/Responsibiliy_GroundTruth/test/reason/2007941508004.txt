The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn from the designated left turn lane while V2 was approaching the intersection with a green light. V1 entered the intersection and stayed in their travel lane, waiting for traffic to clear. However, when V1 proceeded to initiate the left turn, they failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. The driver of V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions, assuming that V2 would stop and yield the right of way. This driver-related decision error led to the collision. Additionally, it was noted that V1 had dangerously low tread depth on the rear tires, which could have contributed to the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 had a green light and did not see V1 prior to the impact. While the driver of V2 had a recognition-related factor, it does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to yield the right of way. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while attempting a left turn.
