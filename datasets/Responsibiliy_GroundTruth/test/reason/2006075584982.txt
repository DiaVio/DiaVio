The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a left turn with an obstructed view, without being able to see V2 approaching. V1 stated that she thought all travel lanes had stopped to let her complete the turn, but she was unable to see V2 due to the intervening vehicles. This decision to turn with an obstructed view ultimately led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet S-10) had a green light and believed he had the right-of-way. He did not see V1 turning because of the obstructed view caused by the intervening vehicles. While V2 may have contributed to the accident by encroaching over the left lane line, V1's decision to turn without a clear view of oncoming traffic is the primary factor that led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her decision to turn with an obstructed view.
