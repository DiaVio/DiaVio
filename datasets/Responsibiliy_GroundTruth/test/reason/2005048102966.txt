The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) in a 72 kmph (45 mph) speed limit zone, which indicates that they were driving too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver was internally distracted while looking for their phone, which further contributed to the crash. The driver's internal distraction and excessive speed caused them to lose control of the vehicle while negotiating a left-hand curve. They initially departed the road on the right side, then overcompensated by steering left and reentering the roadway, only to steer back to the right and depart the road again. This sequence of events ultimately led to the vehicle tripping and rolling before coming to a rest. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their excessive speed, internal distraction, and overcompensation while negotiating the curve.
