The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not wearing a seat belt, which is a violation of traffic safety regulations. This lack of restraint resulted in the driver moving forward and to the right during the collision, causing contact with various parts of the vehicle's interior, including the knee bolster and steering column. The injuries sustained by the driver, such as the femur fracture and chest injuries, can be attributed to this lack of restraint and subsequent movement within the vehicle. Additionally, the clockwise rotation of Vehicle 1 at impact further supports the driver's responsibility, as evidenced by the deformity of the gear shift bent mainly to the right. This indicates lateral movement during the crash, which could have been prevented or minimized with the use of a seat belt. It is important to note that the involvement of another occupant in the passenger compartment and the possibility of their interaction contributing to some of the injuries does not absolve the driver of their primary responsibility for the accident. The driver's failure to wear a seat belt and the resulting movement within the vehicle are the main factors contributing to the severity of the injuries sustained.
