The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by misjudging the gap and speed of V2 (the 1998 Honda Accord) while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. Additionally, the driver's view of V2 was partially obscured by headlight glare, which may have contributed to the misjudgment. V2, on the other hand, is not primarily responsible for the crash. Although the driver of V2 was conversing with his passenger just before the crash, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction across the left lane line. This suggests that V1's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic was the main contributing factor to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to a decision error and misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2 while making a left turn at the intersection.
