The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the Ford Explorer). V1 had a flashing red light and should have yielded to the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. However, V1 failed to see V2 and proceeded to cross into its path, resulting in the collision.
