The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the stop sign, crossed multiple lanes of traffic, and ultimately departed the roadway. The driver of V1 admitted to being unfamiliar with the roadway and being fatigued at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver was distracted by talking with the passenger. These factors, combined with the driver's inattention and lack of experience on the roadway, contributed to the crash.
