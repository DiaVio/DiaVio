The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, as indicated by the statement "V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck on the left side by the front of V2." Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," suggesting that the driver of V1 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before entering the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance are the primary factors that led to the collision.
