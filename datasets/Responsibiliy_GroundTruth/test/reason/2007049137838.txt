The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver stated that V2 cut him off from the lane to his left and braked in front of him. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to maintain a safe following distance and be able to stop in time to avoid a collision, regardless of the actions of other drivers. In this case, V1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended V2, causing a chain reaction collision with V3.
