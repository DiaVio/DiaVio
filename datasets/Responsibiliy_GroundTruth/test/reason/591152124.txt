The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes to the right with the intention of going around the back of the stopped fire truck. However, V1 ended up striking the back left of V2, the fire truck, and underrode the larger vehicle. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain proper control and collided with the stationary emergency vehicle.
