The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the right, impacting the left rear of V2 (the 2003 Nissan Sentra). V1 then continued to drive, crossed lanes two and three, and departed the roadway to the left, ultimately impacting a street light pole. The driver of V1 admitted to being "totally intoxicated" at the time of the crash, which impaired their ability to control the vehicle. The critical reason for the critical event was attributed to V1 and coded as a driver-related error: poor directional control. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected make them primarily responsible for the accident.
