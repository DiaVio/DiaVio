The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. They glanced for cross-traffic but did not see V1 approaching, indicating a lack of attention and inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V2 was inexperienced, having only been licensed for 5 months, which may have contributed to their failure to properly assess the situation.
