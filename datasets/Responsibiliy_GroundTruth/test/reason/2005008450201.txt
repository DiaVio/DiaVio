The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain proper control of the vehicle while negotiating a downhill grade with a slight right-hand curve. The driver initially veered into the opposing lane but then overcompensated to the right, causing the vehicle to leave the roadway and collide with a utility pole and a tree. The poor directional control exhibited by the driver ultimately led to the critical precrash event of the vehicle traveling off the roadway to the right.
