The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it swerved onto the gravel shoulder to avoid a southbound vehicle that was passing another vehicle in the northbound lane. While attempting to return to the roadway, V1 locked up its brakes and departed the roadway, ultimately impacting the soft mud in the ditch. This sequence of actions by V1 indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and exercise proper caution, resulting in the accident.
