Reason: V2 was traveling in the wrong lane, passing the transit bus from the parking lane, and entering V1's path of travel. This action caused the collision and subsequent loss of control, resulting in V2 striking a light pole. Additionally, the driver of V2 did not provide a full interview and sought legal counsel, which suggests potential liability.
