The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle slowly drifting across the center lane and off the road, ultimately colliding with a utility pole. The driver's statement, along with the witness report, supports the conclusion that the driver's drowsiness and subsequent non-performance error were the critical reasons for the crash. Additionally, the driver's lack of sleep the night before, combined with the fact that she decided to continue driving despite feeling drowsy, further reinforces her responsibility for the accident. The driver's use of multiple medications, including those for depression and bipolar disorder, may have also contributed to her fatigue and impaired driving ability. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's falling asleep at the wheel and the associated factors of fatigue, emotional factors, and medication use.
