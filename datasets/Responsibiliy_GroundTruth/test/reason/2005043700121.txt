The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 crossed the center line while negotiating a left curve, resulting in a collision with V2 (the driver of the 1993 Honda Accord sedan). This indicates that V1 was not maintaining their lane and encroached into the oncoming traffic, causing the crash. Additionally, the critical reason for V1's actions was reported as sleeping, suggesting that the driver may have been fatigued or drowsy at the time of the accident. On the other hand, V2 was traveling within their lane and did not contribute to the cause of the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction over the left lane line, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to crossing the center line and encroaching into the oncoming traffic while negotiating a curve.
