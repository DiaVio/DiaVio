The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was coded as "driver related factor: internal distraction." This indicates that the driver of vehicle one was distracted internally, possibly due to being on the phone with her mother. This distraction likely caused her to enter the intersection and impact vehicle two on its left plane. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, across path." This suggests that vehicle two was not at fault for the collision, as it was simply crossing the intersection when it was impacted by vehicle one. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's internal distraction.
