The reason for this is that V1 hit V2 from behind, causing V2 to spin out of control and ultimately be struck by V3. Since V1 left the scene of the crash and no further information is known about the vehicle or driver, it is difficult to determine any other contributing factors. However, the fact that V1 was traveling at the same speed as V2 (105 kmph) suggests that V1 may not have been maintaining a safe following distance or paying attention to the road conditions, which were wet due to the rain.
