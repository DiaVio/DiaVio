The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize the stop sign and was traveling too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver was distracted by conversing with friends and looking for an address, which further contributed to the decision error. The driver's lack of experience, having only been driving for 7 months, also played a role in the crash. The poorly lit road and the absence of a sign indicating a sharp left curve ahead are highway-related factors that may have contributed to the driver's difficulty in navigating the road.
