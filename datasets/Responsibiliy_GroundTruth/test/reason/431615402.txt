The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the roadway to the right, impacting a concrete traffic barrier. It then crossed all six southbound travel lanes before impacting a second concrete barrier. V1 rotated off the second barrier before coming to a rest partially in the left express lane. The driver of V1 was also unrestrained at the time of the crash, sitting on the seat belt. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
