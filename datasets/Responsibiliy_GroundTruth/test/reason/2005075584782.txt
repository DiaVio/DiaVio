The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a heart attack or other physical impairment that affected her ability to act, leading to the vehicle departing the right side of the road and ultimately crashing into a metal pole and ending up in a canal. The passenger's statement also supports this, as she noticed the driver's physical distress before the accident occurred.
