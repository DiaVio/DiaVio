The driver of V1 admitted to following too closely and was unable to stop in time, resulting in a chain reaction collision involving V2 and V3. The driver's claim of wet brakes due to the rain is not a valid excuse for not maintaining a safe distance and causing the accident. Additionally, the driver was cited for driving with a suspended license, indicating a disregard for traffic laws.
