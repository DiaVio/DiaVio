The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an unsafe lane change without properly checking for other vehicles. This resulted in a non-contact vehicle, which had been following V1, swinging out into the same lane at a high rate of speed to pass V1. In response to this sudden maneuver, the driver of V1 swerved right, overcompensated, and lost control of the vehicle, ultimately causing it to exit the roadway and collide with a tree. Additionally, factors contributing to the crash include the driver's unfamiliarity with both the roadway and the newly acquired vehicle. The driver had just picked up V1 from the dealership and was driving it for the first time, which likely affected her ability to handle the vehicle properly in the given situation. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the unsafe lane change and the driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle and roadway.
