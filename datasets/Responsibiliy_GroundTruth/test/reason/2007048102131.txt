The reason for V1's responsibility is that they entered the intersection and turned left without having a clear view of oncoming traffic, specifically V2. The driver of V1 stated that they did not see V2 prior to the crash due to the presence of a large truck in the eastbound lane. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2006 Dodge Stratus) is not primarily responsible for the accident. While V2 was involved in the critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2. Therefore, it can be inferred that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to turn with a clear view of oncoming traffic, while V2 is not primarily responsible as the critical reason for their involvement in the pre-crash event was not coded to them.
