The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 56 kmph (35 mph), which was 16 kmph (10 mph) above the posted advisory speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). Additionally, the right rear tire of V1 had only 103 KPA (15 PSI) of pressure, which contributed to the loss of control and fishtailing of the vehicle on the wet road. The combination of excessive speed and an under-inflated tire led to V1's inability to negotiate the curve safely, resulting in the collision with the concrete Jersey barrier.
