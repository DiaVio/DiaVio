The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption that there would be no through traffic in lane one (the right turn lane) since it is a right turn only into the private driveway. This false assumption led to V1 attempting the left turn across lane one without ensuring that it was clear, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's view of the traffic in lane one was obstructed by a tractor-trailer, which further contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the situation before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise caution and properly assess the traffic conditions, along with the false assumption made, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
