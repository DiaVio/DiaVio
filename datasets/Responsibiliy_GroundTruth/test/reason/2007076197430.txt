The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling at a high speed of 104 kmph (65 mph) in the #2 lane, which was already closed to through traffic due to the presence of an unoccupied police vehicle (V2) providing traffic control for the previous collision. Witnesses stated that V1 was traveling very fast and could not stop in time to avoid the collisions. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to slow down in response to the backed-up traffic and the presence of the police vehicle in the closed lane make them primarily responsible for the crash.
