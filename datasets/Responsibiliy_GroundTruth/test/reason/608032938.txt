The reason for this is that V2 drifted over the center line into the path of the case vehicle, causing the collision. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, indicating that they were aware of their mistake and tried to correct it. However, their actions were not enough to prevent the impact. Therefore, V2 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
