The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a right turn from the southbound number-three lane into a gas station driveway, crossing southbound lanes two and one without yielding to the oncoming traffic in the number-one lane where Vehicle 2 (V2) was traveling. This action resulted in V1 crossing into V2's path and the front of V2 striking the right side of V1. The impact caused V1 to rotate and make a second contact with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and make a safe right turn is the primary cause of the accident.
