The driver of V1 stated that he had just moved into the #1 lane, was scanning traffic to his side, and thought that traffic ahead of him was moving. However, V1 failed to notice that the vehicles ahead of him were stopped, resulting in the collision. The critical reason for V1's involvement in the accident was attributed to the driver's false assumption of other's actions.
