The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking left and right, the driver failed to see V2 approaching from her left in the second lane. This recognition error led to V1 pulling out and colliding with V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area, which could have contributed to her lack of awareness of the approaching vehicle. However, unfamiliarity with the area does not absolve the driver of the responsibility to ensure a safe turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
