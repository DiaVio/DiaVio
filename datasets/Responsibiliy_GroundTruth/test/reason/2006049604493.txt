The reason for this is that V1 (the 2000 Ford Crown Victoria Sedan driven by the 79-year-old male) was traveling straight through the intersection, following the rules of the stop sign. V2, on the other hand, was traveling east in the third lane and failed to yield the right of way to V1. V2's failure to yield resulted in the front of V2 impacting the left side of V1. Additionally, V2's u-turn path within the intersection indicates a failure to properly navigate the intersection, further supporting their responsibility for the crash.
