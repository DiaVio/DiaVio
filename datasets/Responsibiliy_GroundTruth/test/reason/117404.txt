The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it departed the road and struck a large tree with the right door, resulting in severe impact. The injuries sustained by the case occupant, including the skull and brain injuries, facial and mandibular fractures, rib fractures, and pelvic fractures, were all caused by the contact with the intruding tree trunk and the interior door surface of V1.
