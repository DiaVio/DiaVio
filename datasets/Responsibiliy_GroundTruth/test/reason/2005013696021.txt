The driver of Vehicle #1 ran a red light at the controlled intersection, indicating a violation of traffic laws. This action directly led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (Toyota 4Runner), which had the right-of-way while traveling south in the middle lane. Vehicle #2's driver attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering to the right, but was unable to do so in time. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to obey the traffic signal and their inattention while driving, due to fatigue and being lost in thought, are the main reasons for the accident. Vehicle #2's driver was not thought to have contributed to the crash as they were following traffic laws and attempting to avoid the collision.
