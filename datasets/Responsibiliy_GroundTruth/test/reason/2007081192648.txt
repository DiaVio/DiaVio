The driver of V1 was traveling at an excessive speed for the curve and wet road conditions, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 veering off the road, scraping the curb, and then fishtailing back onto the roadway, ultimately colliding with V2. The driver of V2 attempted to brake and steer to avoid the collision, indicating that they were not at fault for the accident.
