The reason for this is that V2 attempted to turn left from lane two, crossing over the left lane line, which is an illegal maneuver. This action of turning from the wrong lane and not properly surveilling the surroundings led to the collision with Vehicle 1 (V1). V1 was traveling in the correct lane and did not contribute to the cause of the accident.
