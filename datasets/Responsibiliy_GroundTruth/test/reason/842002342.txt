The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the intersection and attempted to turn left (west) across the path of Vehicle 1 (the 1998 Honda Civic EX 2-door coupe). This action resulted in a frontal impact between the two vehicles, causing moderate damage and serious injuries to the driver of Vehicle 1.
