The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and looking down for a moment, resulting in a recognition error. When the driver looked up, they realized that the traffic ahead had come to a stop, but it was too late to avoid a collision. This indicates that V1 was not paying proper attention to the road and failed to react in a timely manner to the traffic situation. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1997 Pontiac Grand Am) was stopped behind another vehicle, following the flow of traffic. V2 was not at fault for the accident as they were stationary and had been waiting for at least one minute due to the traffic interruption caused by the semi-truck exiting the driveway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped traffic ahead.
