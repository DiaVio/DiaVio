The driver of V2 stated that she was traveling south in lane one intending to turn left at the intersection. She claimed that the light was green when she approached and entered the intersection. However, she failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not notice V1, the Honda Civic, approaching from the westbound direction. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to her colliding with the right side of V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic.
