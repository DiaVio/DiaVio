The Critical Precrash Event coded for V2 indicates that it encroached into the opposite lane over the left lane line, which suggests that V2 crossed into the path of V1. This action by V2 caused the front of V2 to make contact with the right front of V1, resulting in the collision. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was intending to make a left turn at the intersection, which is a legal maneuver. However, without further information from the driver of V1, it is uncertain if any other factors contributed to the crash. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to encroaching into the opposite lane, while the responsibility of V1 cannot be determined without additional information.
