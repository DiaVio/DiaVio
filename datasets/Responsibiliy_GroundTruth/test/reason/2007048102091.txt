The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep before traveling off the right side of the road. This indicates that the driver was fatigued and not fully alert while operating the vehicle. Falling asleep while driving is a serious driver-related factor that significantly impairs the driver's ability to control the vehicle and respond to road conditions. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; overcompensation." This suggests that the driver's attempt to steer back onto the road after veering off resulted in overcompensation, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and ultimately strike the ditch in the median. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of falling asleep, the evidence of overcompensation, and the critical pre-crash event, it can be concluded that V1 (the driver) is primarily responsible for the accident.
