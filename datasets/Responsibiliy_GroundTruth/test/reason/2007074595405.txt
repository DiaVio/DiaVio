The reason for this is that V2 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the snowy conditions. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," and the critical reason was coded as "environment related factor; slick roads (low friction road surface due to ice, loose debris, any other cause)." V1 (the driver of the Jeep Cherokee) stated that he saw V2 losing control and came to a stop before the crash, indicating that he took appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to adjust their speed to the snowy conditions and control their vehicle resulted in the accident, making them primarily responsible.
