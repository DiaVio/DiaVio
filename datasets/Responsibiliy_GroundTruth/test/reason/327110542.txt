The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it made a left turn through the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2, the school bus. This resulted in V2 striking the right side of V1 and pushing it across the intersection, causing the accident. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 crossed the path of V2, indicating a failure to properly judge the distance and speed of oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of oncoming traffic make it primarily responsible for the accident.
