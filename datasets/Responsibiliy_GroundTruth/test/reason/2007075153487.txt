The driver of V1 stated that she was stopped at the stop sign, waiting for a black SUV in the northbound lane to clear her line of sight before entering the intersection. However, she failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 (the 1991 Jeep Wrangler) approaching in the northbound lane. This indicates that V1 turned with an obstructed view and failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and turning with an obstructed view led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
