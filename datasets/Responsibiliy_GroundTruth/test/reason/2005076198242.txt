The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was found to be inattentive or daydreaming, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. This suggests that V1 failed to pay attention to the traffic light or the presence of other vehicles, leading to the collision with V2 (the 1998 Toyota Camry). Additionally, V1's statement that the traffic light must have been green indicates a lack of certainty about the traffic signal, further suggesting a lack of attention or awareness. Therefore, V1's inattentiveness and failure to properly observe the traffic situation make them primarily responsible for the accident.
