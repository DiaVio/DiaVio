The reason for this is that V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a car wash sign being held by kids on the side of the road. This distraction caused V1 to not notice that V2 (the 2001 Kia Sephia) was stopped in front of them, resulting in the rear-end collision. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in the roadway waiting for traffic to clear so she could turn left. There is no indication that V2 was at fault or contributed to the accident in any way. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to notice the stopped vehicle in front of them makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
