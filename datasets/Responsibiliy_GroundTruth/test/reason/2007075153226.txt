The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet and slick road conditions. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, which indicates that the driver lost control while negotiating the left curve. Additionally, associated factors such as speeding, slick road surface, and poor weather conditions contribute to the driver's responsibility for the crash.
