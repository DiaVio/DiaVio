The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane." This indicates that V1 changed lanes to the right without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the lack of driver interview and vehicle inspection for V1 makes it difficult to determine the exact reason for the critical event. However, since V1 was the one changing lanes, it is reasonable to assign primary responsibility to them. It is important to note that V2 (the driver of the 1995 Toyota Corolla) was preparing to change lanes to the left but did not recognize that V1 was changing lanes. However, V2's failure to recognize the lane change by V1 does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for initiating the unsafe lane change.
