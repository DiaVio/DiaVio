The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to see the pedestrian until he was right on his windshield. The driver's attention was focused on the bus towards his right front, and he did not adequately survey the trafficway prior to the collision. Additionally, the driver indicated that his attention was on the bus, wondering if it would pull out into his travel lane, which further distracted him from observing the pedestrian. Although there were factors present that may have obstructed the driver's sight line, such as the other vehicle in the adjacent lane, it is ultimately the driver's responsibility to ensure the safety of the roadway and to be aware of pedestrians in the crosswalk.
