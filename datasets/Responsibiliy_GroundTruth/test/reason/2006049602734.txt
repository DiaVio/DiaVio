The driver of Vehicle one made a driver-related decision error by turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view. This indicates that the driver failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Despite claiming that the first two lanes had left a gap for him, the driver did not see Vehicle two (the 2006 BMW 750) in the third lane, resulting in the collision. While the driver of Vehicle two stated that there was no stopped traffic ahead of him and he never saw Vehicle one, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from crossing the street across the path. This suggests that Vehicle two was already in the intersection when Vehicle one turned left, indicating that Vehicle one had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
