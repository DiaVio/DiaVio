The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is aggressive driving behavior, as reported by the driver of Vehicle #2. Vehicle #1 was observed fishtailing and passing through a red light before striking Vehicle #2. Additionally, Vehicle #1 was seen crossing over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating poor directional control. The lack of skid marks suggests that Vehicle #1 was traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions, which were daylight and dry. The driver of Vehicle #1 claimed to have slid through the red light while trying to control the vehicle, but this explanation is not supported by evidence. Vehicle #2, on the other hand, was stopped in the left southbound lane, waiting for the light to turn from red to green. No contributing factors were coded to Vehicle #2, indicating that the driver was not at fault for the crash.
