The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 drifted across the centerline and struck V2 in the eastbound lane. - The driver of V1 admitted to being upset and not thinking straight due to recent news about her ill mother. - V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) reading of 0.307, indicating gross intoxication. - V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 kmph (31 and 40 mph) at the time of impact. - The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions. - The critical precrash event for V1 was a recognition error and driver inattention. - V1's inattention and intoxication led to the vehicle drifting over the lane line and causing the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's inattention, intoxication, and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
