The reason for this is as follows: 1. V1 was fatigued and fell asleep while driving, indicating a lack of attentiveness and inability to control the vehicle properly. 2. V1 tested positive for alcohol and cocaine use, suggesting impaired judgment and decision-making abilities. 3. V1 crossed multiple lanes of traffic, including the center turn lane, before colliding with V2, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane discipline. 4. V1 does not remember the crash, further indicating a lack of awareness and attention while driving. Overall, V1's fatigue, impaired state, and failure to maintain control of the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
