The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which was a critical non-performance error. This resulted in V1 departing the roadway and ultimately rolling over. The driver's fatigue, due to not having slept a full night since two nights prior to the crash, contributed to the critical event. Additionally, work-related stress/pressure may have played a role, as the driver had been required to work extended shifts leading up to the crash. The driver's overcompensation when waking up and realizing V1 had departed the road on the left side also contributed to the crash. The driver's relative unfamiliarity with the road and the work truck, as well as the possible issue with the vehicle feeling like it had a flat tire, were additional associated factors.
