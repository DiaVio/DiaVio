The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicle (V2) ahead of him in the same lane. This recognition error, as stated in the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, indicates that V1's driver was focused on an extraneous vehicle and failed to notice the stopped vehicle in front of him. Contributing factors on the part of V1 include heavy traffic congestion, the driver's fatigue (being up for 13 hours and driving all day), and the condition of the vehicle (recently made roadworthy from a salvage yard with high mileage on its parts). While V2 also had contributing factors such as traffic congestion and the driver's unfamiliarity with the road and vehicle, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the recognition error and failure to stop in time to avoid the collision.
