The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 stated that she did not see the brake lights of V2 (the 2005 Mercury Sable) before the collision. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a proper lookout and failed to react in a timely manner to the stopped vehicle ahead. As a result, V1 struck V2 in the rear, causing the collision. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 32 kmph (20 mph), which suggests that V1 was not able to stop in time to avoid the collision, further supporting the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible. It is important to note that V2 was stopped at a stop/slow sign for the construction zone, indicating that V2 was following the appropriate traffic control device and was not at fault for the accident.
