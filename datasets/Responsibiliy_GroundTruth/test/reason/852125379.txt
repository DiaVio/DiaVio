The reason for this is that V2 started into the intersection after being stopped, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. The impact occurred when the front right corner of V1 impacted the left side front corner of V2, suggesting that V2 entered the intersection without ensuring it was clear and safe to do so.
