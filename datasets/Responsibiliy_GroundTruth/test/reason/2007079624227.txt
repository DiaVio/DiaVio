The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. This resulted in a near-collision with a non-contact vehicle in the adjacent lane. In an attempt to avoid contact, V1 overcompensated by swerving back into their original lane, which led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control ultimately caused the collision with the center divider. Additionally, the fact that V1 was traveling at a reported speed of 105 kmph (above the speed limit of 104 kmph) may have contributed to the driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle after the initial swerve. Overall, V1's failure to properly execute a lane change and subsequent overcompensation are the primary factors that led to the collision.
