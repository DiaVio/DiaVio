The reason for this is that V2 was traveling through the intersection controlled by a stop sign, indicating that V2 had the duty to yield the right of way to any vehicles already in the intersection. V1, the 1998 Chevrolet S10 Pickup truck, was already in the intersection and had the right of way since there were no traffic controls in their direction. Therefore, V2 failed to yield the right of way and collided with V1, causing the crash.
