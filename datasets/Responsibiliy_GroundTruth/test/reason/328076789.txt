The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver relinquished control of the vehicle due to a medical condition. This loss of control caused V1 to travel over the center line and depart the left road edge, resulting in the subsequent impacts with the utility pole and trees. The driver's medical condition led to the inability to maintain control of the vehicle, making V1 responsible for the accident.
