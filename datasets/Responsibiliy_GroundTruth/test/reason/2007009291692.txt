The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and making a false assumption that the vehicles in lane one would move forward, like the vehicles in the adjacent lanes. This led to her failing to notice that the traffic in lane one remained stopped, resulting in her rear-ending V2 (the 2004 Volvo S60) and causing a chain reaction with V3 (the 2000 Buick LeSabre).
