The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 hydroplaned and began to rotate clockwise, indicating a loss of control. - The driver's attempt to steer left and brake suggests an attempt to regain control. - However, V1 ultimately traveled off the road and struck trees in the median. - The driver's impaired state due to DUI, fatigue, and potential drug use likely contributed to the loss of control and inability to safely navigate the wet road conditions. - The low tread on V1's tires may have further compromised traction and control. Overall, V1's actions and the driver's impaired state make them primarily responsible for the crash.
