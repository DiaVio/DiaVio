The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop at the red light, causing the collision with V1. The driver of V2 admitted to being engaged in a social conversation with his passenger, which likely contributed to his inattention and unfamiliarity with the roadway. This recognition error and failure to stop at the red light led to the collision with V1.
