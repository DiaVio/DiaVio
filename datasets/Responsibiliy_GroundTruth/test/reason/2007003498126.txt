The driver of V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V1). This failure to properly assess the situation and recognize the presence of V1 resulted in the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn.
