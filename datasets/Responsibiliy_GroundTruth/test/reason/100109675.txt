The driver of Vehicle 1 observed a disabled vehicle ahead in his lane due to a previous crash and attempted to avoid it by steering left. However, the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to strike the guardrail with its front left. This impact redirected the vehicle to the right, crossing the northbound lanes in a clockwise yaw. As the vehicle traveled off onto the traffic island, it struck the metering light with its front right and continued across the entrance ramp before ultimately overturning and coming to rest on its top. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the disabled vehicle ahead, resulting in the subsequent collision and overturning, indicates that Vehicle 1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
