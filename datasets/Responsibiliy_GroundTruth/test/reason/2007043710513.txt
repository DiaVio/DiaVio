The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn. She misunderstood the traffic signal and entered the intersection assuming she had the right of way, without realizing that V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) was approaching. This driver-related factor, specifically internal distraction due to a conversation with her passenger, contributed to her failure to recognize the correct traffic signal and the presence of V2. Additionally, V1 had limited driving experience, having only driven for a year with informal training provided by friends. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction, over left lane line." This suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident, as V1's failure to yield the right of way was the main contributing factor. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn, which was caused by internal distraction and limited driving experience.
