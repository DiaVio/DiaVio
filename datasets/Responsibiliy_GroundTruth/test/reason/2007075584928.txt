The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not detect the presence of V2 (the driver of the 1999 Ford Crown Victoria) before proceeding through the intersection. V1 was distracted by the non-contact vehicle and falsely assumed it was going to turn left, which led to a false assumption that lane two was a left turn lane only. Additionally, the obstructed view caused by the non-contact vehicle further contributed to V1's failure to detect V2. On the other hand, V2 had already stopped and believed he had the right of way after the non-contact vehicle cleared the intersection. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from crossing street, across path, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance, distraction, false assumptions, and an obstructed view.
