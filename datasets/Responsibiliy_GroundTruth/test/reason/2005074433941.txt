The reason for this is that V1 was driving at a high rate of speed, changed lanes to the left, and collided with the left side of V2 (the sedan) as it was making a left turn after stopping at a stop sign. Additionally, V1 violated a traffic signal, accelerated excessively while weaving in and out of travel lanes, and failed to look far enough ahead for possible crossing traffic. The fact that the driver of V1 had an abnormal level of amphetamine in their system further suggests that their impaired judgment and aggressive driving behaviors contributed to the collision.
