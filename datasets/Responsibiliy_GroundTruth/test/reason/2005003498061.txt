The reason for this is that the Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle # 2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling crossing over (passing through) intersection." This indicates that Vehicle # 2 was the one crossing the intersection and potentially violating the right of way of Vehicle # 1. Since Vehicle # 1 was traveling on the left lane of the westbound roadway, it can be assumed that Vehicle # 2 failed to yield or failed to stop at the intersection, resulting in the front of Vehicle # 2 contacting the left side of Vehicle # 1. However, it is important to note that the driver of Vehicle # 1 declined to participate in the study, so there may be additional factors or details that could affect the determination of responsibility.
