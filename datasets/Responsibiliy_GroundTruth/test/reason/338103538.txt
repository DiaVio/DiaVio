The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed their vehicle to cross the centerline and enter the westbound travel lane, directly into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4x4 4-door sport utility). This action resulted in a full frontal collision between the two vehicles, causing severe damage to Vehicle 1 and serious injuries to its driver.
