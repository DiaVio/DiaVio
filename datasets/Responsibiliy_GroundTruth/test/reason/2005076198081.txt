The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 experienced a blackout, which was identified as a driver-related factor. This physical impairment of the ability to act resulted in V1 departing the left side of the road and subsequently exhibiting poor directional control and overcompensation while trying to return to the roadway. These actions ultimately led to the rollover crash.
