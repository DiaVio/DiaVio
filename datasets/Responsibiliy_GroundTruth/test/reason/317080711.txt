The reason for this determination is that V1 left the roadway on the south side, traveled a significant distance before re-entering the travel lane, crossed the center line into the westbound lane, and ultimately departed the north side of the roadway. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the accident.
