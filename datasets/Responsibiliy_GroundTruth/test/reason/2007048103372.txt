The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection." This indicates that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a potentially risky maneuver. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." Although the specific error is unknown, it suggests that the driver of V1 may have made an error while making the left turn, leading to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the left turn maneuver and the unknown driver error.
