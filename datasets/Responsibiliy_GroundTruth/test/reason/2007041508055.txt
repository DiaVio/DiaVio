The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction that resulted in V2 hitting V3. V1's failure to stop indicates a driver-related error, as there were no external factors mentioned that would have prevented V1 from stopping in time. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 64 kmph, which suggests that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the congested traffic conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and the resulting collision make them primarily responsible for the accident.
