The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the roadway on the right side and struck the guardrail twice, resulting in the car coming to rest against the guardrail facing in the opposite direction of traffic. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was when it departed the roadway on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was an unknown driver error. Since no mechanical problems were found during the inspection of V1 and the driver could provide no information on why she departed the roadway, it suggests that the driver of V1 was at fault for the crash.
