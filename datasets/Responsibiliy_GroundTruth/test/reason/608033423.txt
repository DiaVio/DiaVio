The reason for this is that V1 was stopped in the crossover of the roadway, waiting to complete a left turn into a private driveway. V1 proceeded to cross the northbound lanes without having a clear field of view of approaching traffic. This action resulted in V1 entering the path of Vehicle 2 (V2) and being struck on the right side. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and proceed without a clear view of oncoming traffic makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
