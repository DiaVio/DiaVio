The reason for V1's responsibility is that it crossed the double yellow line at an angle, entered the southbound travel lane, and struck V2 (the Chevrolet Cavalier sedan) traveling in the opposite direction. V1's loss of control due to poor road conditions (slick roads) and speed too fast for the conditions contributed to the crash. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in its designated lane and did not have any contributing factors mentioned that would make it primarily responsible for the crash.
