The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and looked down to adjust the CD player, causing the vehicle to edge off the right side of the road. This distraction led to the vehicle striking a mailbox, a utility pole, and trees before coming to rest partially off the road. The driver's inexperience and engagement in strenuous recreational activities were also contributing factors. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
