The reason for this determination is that V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, striking a fire hydrant, fence, and tree. The driver of V1 left the scene and was not interviewed, so there is no further information available about their actions or potential factors contributing to the crash. However, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine the specific driver-related factor or error that led to the crash. However, the fact that V1 traveled off the road and struck multiple objects suggests a lack of control or attention on the part of the driver.
