The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that it experienced a loss of control due to poor road conditions, specifically a slick spot on the roadway. This is supported by the fact that V2 began a counterclockwise longitudinal skid, indicating a lack of traction on the road surface. V2's loss of control ultimately led to the collision with V1. V1 (the 1999 Saturn LS2) was traveling in the second travel lane and there is no indication that it was engaged in any unsafe or negligent behavior. Therefore, V1 cannot be held primarily responsible for the crash.
