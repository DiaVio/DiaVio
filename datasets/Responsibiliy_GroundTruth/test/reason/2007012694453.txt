The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to notice that V2 had come to a stop for traffic. This is indicated by the Critical Reason for the Critical Event being coded as a driver-related factor - recognition error - external distraction. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to not noticing the stopped traffic until it was too late, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. While V2 (the driver of the 1998 Chevrolet K1500 pick-up truck) may have contributed to the accident by not realizing there was a vehicle coming up behind him, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to recognize and react to the stopped traffic in front of them.
