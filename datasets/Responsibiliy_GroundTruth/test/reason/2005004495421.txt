The reason for this is that V2, the Hyundai Accent coupe, failed to stop at the stop sign and collided with V1, the Toyota Matrix hatchback, which was already in the intersection. V2's failure to stop and yield the right of way resulted in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 was distracted by conversing with her niece, which contributed to the recognition error and inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the stop sign, distracted driving, and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
