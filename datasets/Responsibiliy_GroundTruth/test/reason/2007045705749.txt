The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 pulled out from a private drive and stopped between the double yellow lines on the north leg of the intersection, preparing for a right turn onto the road intersecting from the west. - V1 attempted the right turn without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic in lane one of the north/south roadway. - V1 made an illegal maneuver by turning from a non-designated lane. - V1 had an obstructed view due to tinted windows and claimed not being able to see well. - V1 was emotionally unstable and preoccupied with personal issues, which contributed to inadequate surveillance and inattentiveness. - V1 was fatigued due to pregnancy, lack of recent sleep, and constant arguing with her ex-boyfriend. - V1 was taking several medications, including an anti-psychotic drug. These factors indicate that V1's actions and condition significantly contributed to the crash, making them primarily responsible.
