The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to use due care and made a false assumption about the actions of Vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that she saw that Vehicle #2 had a yellow light and assumed it was going to stop for the red light. This false assumption led to Vehicle #1 initiating a left turn in front of Vehicle #2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was operating a vehicle with a learner's permit without an adult in the car, which is a violation of the law. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to use due care, false assumption, and violation of the law, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
