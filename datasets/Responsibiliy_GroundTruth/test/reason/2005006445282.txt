The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 stopped in the travel lane and stated that he looked down for an unknown reason, resulting in a recognition error and internal distraction. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying proper attention to the road and failed to notice the stopped vehicle in front of him. Additionally, the driver of V1 is described as a high school student with limited driving experience, which suggests that inexperience could have been a causal factor in this accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain proper attention and control of the vehicle.
