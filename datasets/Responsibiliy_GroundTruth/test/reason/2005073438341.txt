The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the travel lane before entering it from the parking lane. The driver looked but did not see V2's approach in the travel lane prior to entering it. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by having a conversation with her child whom she had just picked up from school. These factors indicate that V1's driver was not exercising proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
