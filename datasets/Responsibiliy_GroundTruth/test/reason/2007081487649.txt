The driver of V1 initiated a U-turn in the intersection, which is considered an illegal maneuver in most jurisdictions. This action violated traffic laws and resulted in the collision with V2 (the 1987 Acura Legend sedan). V1's inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the driver's failure to look or see the oncoming vehicle, further supports their responsibility for the accident.
