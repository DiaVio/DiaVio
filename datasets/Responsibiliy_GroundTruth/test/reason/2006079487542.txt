The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they took incorrect evasive action when encountering the dog in the roadway. Instead of braking or swerving safely to avoid the dog, V1 veered left abruptly, causing their vehicle to skid across the center stripes and collide with V2 (the 2005 Honda CR-V). While V2 was encroaching over the left lane line, the critical reason for the pre-crash event of V2 was not attributed to their actions. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute significantly to the primary responsibility for the collision. In summary, V1's incorrect evasive action in response to the dog in the roadway is the primary reason for the collision.
