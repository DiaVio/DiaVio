The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an other decision error by changing lanes without adequately surveilling the road ahead. This decision was influenced by the presence of the non-contact vehicle, which caused a sightline restriction. As a result, V1 failed to notice V2, the stationary recycling truck, in lane one and rear-ended it.
