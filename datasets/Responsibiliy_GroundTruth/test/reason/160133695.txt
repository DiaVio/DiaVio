The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, crossing the path of Vehicle two (V2), the 2003 Ford Escape utility vehicle, which was traveling straight in its designated lane. V1's right side made contact with the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2.
