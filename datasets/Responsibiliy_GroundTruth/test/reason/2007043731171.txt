The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by swerving into the grass median instead of braking to avoid the collision with the merging truck. The police report also states that the driver of V1 could have prevented the crash by braking instead of changing lanes. Additionally, factors such as the driver's use of prescription medication to control high blood pressure and poor directional control were associated with the driver of V1, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to react appropriately in the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and failure to brake to avoid the collision.
