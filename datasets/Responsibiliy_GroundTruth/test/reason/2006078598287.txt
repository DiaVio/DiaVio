The driver of V1 entered the intersection on a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a disregard of the traffic control signal. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for inadequate surveillance and the sight line restriction created by surrounding vehicles. These factors indicate that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that the intersection was clear before proceeding. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their illegal maneuver, inadequate surveillance, and failure to adhere to traffic control signals.
