The reason for this is that V1, the driver of the Dodge Grand Caravan, attempted to make a left turn at the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2, the driver of the Honda Accord. V1 stated that she stopped at the stop sign and was waiting to turn left, but it was not clear if she actually stopped or not. Regardless, V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and turned left in front of V2, resulting in the collision. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by applying her brakes, indicating that she was not at fault for the accident.
