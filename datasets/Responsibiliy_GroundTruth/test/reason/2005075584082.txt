The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. This illegal maneuver of disregarding the traffic control stop sign directly led to the collision with V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier coupe). Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was arrested for DUI, indicating that the driver was under the influence of alcohol, which further contributed to their responsibility for the accident.
