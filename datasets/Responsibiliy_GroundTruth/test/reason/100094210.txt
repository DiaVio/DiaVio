The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction in the median and made a steering maneuver to the left, causing it to enter the eastbound lanes and collide with V1. This action by V2 resulted in the collision and subsequent rotation of both vehicles. Additionally, V2 had swerved into the eastbound lanes at least once prior to the crash, indicating a lack of control and awareness on the part of the driver.
