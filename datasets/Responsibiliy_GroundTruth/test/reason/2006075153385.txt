The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a driver-related decision error by taking incorrect evasive action. The driver veered to the right to avoid an animal in the roadway, but instead of safely maneuvering back onto the road, V1 departed the road to the right side and collided with two trees. This decision ultimately led to the collision and subsequent damage to V1.
