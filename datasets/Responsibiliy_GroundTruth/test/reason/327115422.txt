The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, resulting in a clockwise yaw and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle on a wet road suggests a lack of proper driving skills or negligence, which led to the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was unrestrained further indicates a failure to take necessary precautions for safety.
