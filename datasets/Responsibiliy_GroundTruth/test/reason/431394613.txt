The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to execute a left turn from the left turn only lane, crossing the path of oncoming traffic (V2). V2, which was traveling straight in the northbound lane, had the right of way. V1 entered the intersection and was impacted on the left side by the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic.
