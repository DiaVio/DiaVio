The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to not seeing V2 (the 1996 Jeep Cherokee) entering the intersection, which indicates a lack of attention and awareness on their part. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, V2's driver stated that she saw V1 as she approached the intersection and attempted to avoid the crash by steering right and applying the brakes. This suggests that V2 was taking appropriate measures to prevent a collision, but was unable to do so due to V1's failure to yield the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
