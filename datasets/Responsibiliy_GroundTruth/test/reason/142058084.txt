The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 impacted the left side of Vehicle #1 (2003 Jaguar) as it entered the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle #2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #1, which was already in the intersection. Additionally, Vehicle #2 rotated counter clockwise after the initial impact, suggesting that it was the vehicle that caused the collision to occur. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
