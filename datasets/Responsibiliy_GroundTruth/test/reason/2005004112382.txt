The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, an 18-year-old female, admitted to being distracted and not realizing how close she was to V2 (the 1999 Chevy Silverado pick-up). She stated that she was talking to her friend and failed to recognize the proximity of V2. Additionally, V1 was traveling between 50 and 64 KMPH (31 and 40 MPH) at the time of impact, which indicates that V1 was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. V2, on the other hand, was stopped in traffic and did not take any avoidance actions. The driver of V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from V2.
