The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she never saw V2 due to the presence of non-contact vehicles in the westbound left turn lanes. This indicates that V1 did not have a clear view of the oncoming traffic and proceeded to make the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford F150 pickup) was traveling in his designated lane and did not have any contributing factors that would make him primarily responsible for the accident. Although V2 was coded for encroaching over the left lane line, this was not directly related to the critical pre-crash event for V2 and was not coded to his vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factor of turning with an obstructed view, while V2 does not bear primary responsibility based on the information provided.
