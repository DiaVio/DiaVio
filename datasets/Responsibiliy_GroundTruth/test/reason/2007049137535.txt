The reason for V1's responsibility is that they entered the intersection and turned left without yielding the right-of-way to V2 (the driver of the Mitsubishi Eclipse). V1 falsely assumed that eastbound traffic had a red light, which was a driver-related factor and a false assumption of other's actions. V2, on the other hand, did not realize that V1 was not going to yield the right-of-way until the impact, but they did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. While V2 made a false assumption that V1 would yield the right-of-way, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. Therefore, V2's actions were not the primary cause of the accident.
