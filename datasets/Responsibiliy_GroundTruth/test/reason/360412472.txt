The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 pulled over for unknown reasons and then turned around, starting to travel north in the southbound lanes. This action of driving in the wrong direction on the freeway directly led to the head-on collision with Vehicle Two (V2), the 1996 Subaru Impreza four-door sedan, which was traveling south in the correct direction.
