The driver of V2 attempted to pass through the intersection by changing lanes and going around a stopped vehicle in the opposite direction. This action resulted in V2 encroaching into the left lane and colliding with V1, which was making a left turn. Although V1 had a sight line restriction caused by the non-contact vehicle waiting to make a left in the opposing lane, it was V2's decision to change lanes and pass through the intersection that ultimately led to the collision. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and encroachment into the left lane make them primarily responsible for the accident.
