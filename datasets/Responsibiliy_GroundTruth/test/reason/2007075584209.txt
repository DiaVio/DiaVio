The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, which resulted in the collision with V1. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver did not look or failed to see V1 approaching. Additionally, the rain and wet roads were associated factors for both drivers, but it does not absolve V2 of responsibility for not properly observing the intersection before making the turn.
