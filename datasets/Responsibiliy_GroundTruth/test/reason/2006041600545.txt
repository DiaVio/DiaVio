The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way when pulling out of the gas station and crossing the lanes to make a left turn. V1 stated that she did not see V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) and claimed that her view was blocked by traffic in lane one. However, V2 reported that he did not see V1 until it was too late and she was already in his lane. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was identified as "this vehicle traveling, turning right at the intersection" and the critical reason was "inadequate surveillance, looked but did not see." This suggests that V1 did not properly assess the oncoming traffic before pulling out. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance make her primarily responsible for the accident.
