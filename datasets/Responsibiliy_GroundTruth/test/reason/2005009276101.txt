The reason for this is that V1 was turning left from the southbound lane onto an eastbound roadway, crossing the path of V2 (the 2005 Toyota Corolla) traveling northbound on the same roadway. V1 pulled into the intersection, causing V2 to strike it in the right side. V2 stated that she was going straight on the northbound lane of the highway at the speed limit and did not know there was a turning lane there. She attempted to brake but was unable to avoid the collision. Based on this information, it can be concluded that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. The fact that the gas station owners mentioned frequent crashes at that intersection further suggests that there may be a visibility or design issue that contributed to the accident. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the exact reason for V1's failure to yield.
