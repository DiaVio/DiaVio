The reason for V3's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead. He admitted to looking at his vehicle's gauges and did not realize that the traffic in front of him had stopped. This distraction, combined with his frustration with traffic, led to him failing to brake in time and colliding with the rear of V2, which then caused V2 to collide with the rear of V1.
