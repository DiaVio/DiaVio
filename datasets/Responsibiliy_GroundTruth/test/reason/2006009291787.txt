The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control while negotiating the curve of the on-ramp. The driver attempted to restore stability by steering left but was unsuccessful, resulting in V1 crossing over the right shoulder, knocking down a light pole, and colliding with a guardrail. The driver's non-driving activities of trying to put on her lap and shoulder belt while steering with her knees likely contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, traveling too fast for the wet conditions and the weather (rain) were associated factors that further contributed to the crash.
