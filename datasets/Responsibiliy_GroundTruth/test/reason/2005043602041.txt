The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn in front of oncoming traffic without yielding the right of way. The driver of V1 misjudged the speed of V2 (the 1998 Chrysler Town & Country) and falsely assumed that he could avoid a collision by accelerating his left turn. However, V2 had the right of way as it was traveling straight through the intersection on a green signal. Additionally, it is important to note that the driver of V1 was underage, did not have a driver's license, and was driving without permission. These factors contribute to his inexperience and lack of familiarity with the rules of the road, making him even more responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and his inexperience and lack of proper authorization to drive.
