The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 changed lanes abruptly to the left, which caused the vehicle to travel off the left side of the road and strike the median curb. - V1 then rotated clockwise and struck the right curb before ultimately colliding with a utility pole guy wire. - The driver of V1 claimed to have been "cut off" by another vehicle, but there is no evidence to support this claim, and a witness indicated that there was no other vehicle involved. - Additionally, the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.015, which suggests the presence of alcohol in his system. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, and the critical reason for this event was coded as a driver-related factor: aggressive driving behavior. Therefore, based on the driver's aggressive driving behavior, the lack of evidence supporting the claim of being cut off by another vehicle, and the presence of alcohol in the driver's system, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
