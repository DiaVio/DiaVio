The reason for this is that V1's driver overcompensated when she saw the non-contact vehicle entering her lane. Instead of maintaining control of her vehicle, she accelerated and moved to the left, which caused her to lose control and veer off the left side of the highway. This overcompensation and poor directional control ultimately led to the collision with the breakaway pole. Therefore, V1's driver's actions and lack of control make her primarily responsible for the accident.
