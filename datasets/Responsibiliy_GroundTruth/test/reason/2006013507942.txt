The reason for this is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve in the roadway, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and ultimately resulted in the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not familiar with the roadway and was potentially uncomfortable driving the vehicle may have contributed to her inability to properly navigate the curve.
