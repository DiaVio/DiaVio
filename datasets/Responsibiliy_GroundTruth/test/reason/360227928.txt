The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to change lanes during a left curve on a wet road. This resulted in V1 departing the travel lanes and impacting a jersey barrier. The driver's loss of control and failure to maintain proper lane position ultimately led to the crash.
