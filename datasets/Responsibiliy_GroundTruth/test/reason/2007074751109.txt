The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was distracted and internally distracted, as indicated by the driver's statement that she was thinking about getting bait and stressed about losing her job. - V1 was also fatigued, which likely impaired her ability to pay attention to the road and react to the situation. - The witness statement that V1 was talking on a cell phone further suggests that she was not fully focused on driving. - Additionally, V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.174, indicating that she was driving under the influence of alcohol, which significantly impairs driving abilities. These factors combined indicate that V1's distraction, fatigue, and impaired state due to alcohol consumption were the primary causes of the accident.
