The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle encroachment, from opposite direction over the left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the path of V1, who was attempting to make a left turn. V1, the driver of the Honda Accord, had a solid green light and was making a left turn, assuming that V2 would yield the right of way. However, V2 failed to yield and struck V1 on the right side. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and encroachment into the left lane line led to the collision, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
