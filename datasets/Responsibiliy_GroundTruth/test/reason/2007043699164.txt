The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver reportedly fainted just before a section of roadway that began curving to the left. As a result, V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway and drove off a four-foot downwards embankment into the creek, impacting the opposite creek embankment with its front plane. This indicates that the driver's physical impairment, specifically the fainting episode, directly led to the vehicle leaving the road and causing the crash.
