The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe following distance and was traveling too fast for the conditions. Despite being 4 car lengths behind the vehicle in front of her, V1 was unable to react in time when the car in front suddenly exited to the right, revealing stopped traffic ahead. V1's failure to anticipate and respond to the unexpected actions of others, along with the wet and congested roadway, contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver's restricted sightline and unsuccessful evasive action further demonstrate her responsibility for the crash. The fact that she was taking multiple medications for various conditions may have also impaired her ability to react appropriately in the situation.
