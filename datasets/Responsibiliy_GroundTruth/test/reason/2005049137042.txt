The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop and struck the back of V2, which then caused a chain reaction of collisions involving V3 and V4. Since V1 was the vehicle that initiated the collision by rear-ending V2, it can be concluded that V1 was not able to maintain a safe following distance or failed to react in time to the stopped vehicles ahead.
