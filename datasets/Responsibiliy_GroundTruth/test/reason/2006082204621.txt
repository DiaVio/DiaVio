The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was under the influence of marijuana and alcohol, with a blood alcohol level of 0.231, well above the legal limit. Additionally, the driver was taking multiple medications that may have impaired his ability to operate a vehicle safely. The driver's decision to consume alcohol and drugs, combined with his impaired state, likely contributed to his inability to control the vehicle at the speeds he was traveling. Furthermore, the driver's distraction and lack of attention to the road, as he was worried about his son, also played a role in the collision.
