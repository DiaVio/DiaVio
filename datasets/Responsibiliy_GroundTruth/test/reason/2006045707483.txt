The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 swerved into the northbound lane in an attempt to avoid a collision with southbound traffic. This action resulted in Vehicle #1 being struck by Vehicle #2. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that the driver of Vehicle #1 made an incorrect evasive action. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to look far enough ahead, which was an associated factor to this driver.
