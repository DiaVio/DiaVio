The driver of V1 drifted off the right road edge, overcompensated by steering left, and crossed the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2004 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV). The driver of V1 was also distracted by looking in the rearview mirror, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
