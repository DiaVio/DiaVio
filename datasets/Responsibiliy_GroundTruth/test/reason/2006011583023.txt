The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making a U-turn. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was "this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that the driver of V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic, including V2, before initiating the U-turn. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the roadway and the oncoming vehicle, V2, resulted in the collision.
