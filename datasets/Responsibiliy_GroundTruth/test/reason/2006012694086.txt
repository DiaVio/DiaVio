The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver by attempting to accelerate and make it through the intersection after the light had already turned red. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with traveling too fast for the conditions and being inattentive due to focusing on a personal problem, led to V1 colliding with V2.
