The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a diabetic blackout while driving, which was identified as a critical reason for the critical event. This physical impairment of the driver's ability to act led to V1 traveling over the center lane line into the westbound lane, resulting in the sideswiping of V2 (the 1999 Ford F150 pick-up) and the subsequent collision with V3 (the 1993 Oldsmobile Cutlass) and V4 (the 2004 GMC Envoy).
