The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not observe that V5 was stalled in the traffic lane he was merging into. This lack of surveillance and failure to see the stalled vehicle resulted in V1 striking the rear of V2 and subsequently causing a chain reaction collision involving V3, V4, and V6.
