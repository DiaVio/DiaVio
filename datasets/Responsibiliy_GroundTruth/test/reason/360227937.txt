The reason for this is that V2 was stopped in the outer left turn only lane, intending to make a left turn at the intersection. The driver of V2 began to make the left turn while Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2008 Volkswagen Rabbit two-door hatchback, was crossing through the intersection. V1 braked, but the front of V1 still impacted the front of V2, resulting in the deployment of V1's driver frontal airbag. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the collision.
