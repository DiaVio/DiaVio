The reason for this determination is that V1 departed from the westbound lane and traveled into the eastbound lane, ultimately striking V2 head-on. The fact that V1 crossed into the opposite lane indicates a clear violation of traffic rules and a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, V1 was reported to be traveling at a speed of 120 kmph (75 mph), exceeding the posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). While the reason for the lane departure is not known, the actions of V1 directly led to the collision. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and did not contribute to the cause of the accident.
