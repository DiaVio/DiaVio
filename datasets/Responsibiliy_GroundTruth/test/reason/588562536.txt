The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 drifted off the roadway and then oversteered, causing the vehicle to enter a left side leading yaw. This resulted in Vehicle 1 striking multiple objects, including a support wire, a utility junction box, and a utility pole, before ultimately coming to rest. The driver's actions and loss of control of the vehicle led to the collision.
