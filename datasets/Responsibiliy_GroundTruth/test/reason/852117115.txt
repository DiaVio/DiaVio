The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction (westbound in the eastbound lane) and was attempting to pass another vehicle (V3) in an unsafe manner. This resulted in a head-on collision with Vehicle One (V1), causing V1 to be forced off the road and into a ditch. Additionally, V2's post-impact rotation caused it to collide with V3, further contributing to the accident.
