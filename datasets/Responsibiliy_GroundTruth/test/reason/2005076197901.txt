The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which was the critical pre-crash event. This driver-related factor directly led to the vehicle crossing multiple lanes, striking a metal post and bushes, and ultimately rolling over onto its top. The driver's drowsiness and lack of sleep, combined with being awake for over 21 hours, impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
