The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was the vehicle that initiated the chain of events leading to the collision. V1 was forced to steer quickly to the right to avoid the non-contact pickup truck towing a trailer that merged into its lane. This sudden maneuver caused V1 to collide with V2 (the Mitsubishi Eclipse) in lane one. V1 then overcorrected back to the left, crossing all lanes of travel and impacting V3 (the Acura Integra) in lane four. Although V2 was also involved in the collision, V1's actions of swerving into V2's lane and causing the initial impact make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
