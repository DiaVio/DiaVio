The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 (the GMC pickup truck) and subsequently collided with the back of V2. This indicates that V1 was likely following too closely, which is a violation of traffic laws and a common cause of rear-end collisions. Additionally, the fact that V1's driver refused to answer any questions and the relative's statement that they did not know where he was coming from or going suggests a lack of attention or awareness on the part of V1's driver. This, combined with the unknown speed at which V1 was traveling, further supports their primary responsibility for the crash. While it is mentioned that it was snowing at the time of the crash, this factor is not directly attributed to either driver as the cause of the crash. However, it may have contributed to the overall road conditions and potentially affected the drivers' ability to stop or maneuver their vehicles. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and their lack of attention or awareness.
