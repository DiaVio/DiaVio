The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 and was unable to stop in time due to the wet road conditions. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by checking the rearview mirror, which caused her to lose focus on the road ahead. Additionally, V1's brakes locked and the vehicle slid on the wet pavement, resulting in the collision with the rear of V2. V2, on the other hand, was following the appropriate traffic rules by coming to a stop in lane two to make a left turn. V2 made no avoidance maneuvers, indicating that the driver was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely, being distracted, and failing to maintain control of the vehicle on wet roads.
