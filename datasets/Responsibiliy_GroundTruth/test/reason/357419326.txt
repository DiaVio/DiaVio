The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver lost control of the vehicle, crossed through multiple lanes, and ultimately struck a concrete barrier in an oblique, off-set frontal mode. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within her lane, leading to the collision with the barrier. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which could have contributed to the severity of her injuries.
