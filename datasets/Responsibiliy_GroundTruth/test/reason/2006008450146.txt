The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost consciousness and departed the roadway, ultimately contacting a utility pole. The driver stated that he had severe flu symptoms and believes he blacked out prior to the accident. This critical non-performance error, combined with driver fatigue from lifting heavy pieces of wood on his first day back to work after being laid off, contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
