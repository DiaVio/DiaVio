The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was distracted internally, as stated in the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. The driver admitted to talking to the passenger while proceeding through the intersection. This distraction likely caused the driver to fail to yield the right of way to Vehicle two (1994 Saturn SL2), resulting in the collision.
