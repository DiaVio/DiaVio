The reason for this is that V1 was traveling off the edge of the road on the left side, which was the critical pre-crash event. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; unknown critical non-performance." This suggests that the driver of V1 was not able to perform a critical action that could have prevented the accident, and the exact reason for this non-performance is unknown. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 struck the right side of V2, indicating that V1 was not able to maintain control of their vehicle within their lane. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident. It is important to note that the driver of V1 has a history of hypoglycemic seizures, which could potentially be a contributing factor to the accident. However, since the driver denies having had a seizure and there is no evidence to suggest that a seizure occurred during the crash, it cannot be definitively stated that the seizure was the cause of the accident.
