The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver initiated a lane change without properly checking if Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2000 Toyota Camry, was occupying the lane. This resulted in a collision between the left rear of V1 and the right side of V2, causing V1 to lose control. Additionally, V1's subsequent actions of steering back to the left and causing the vehicle to enter a counterclockwise yaw further contributed to the accident. The loss of control and subsequent rollover of V1 can be attributed to the driver's actions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly check for other vehicles before initiating a lane change and subsequent loss of control.
