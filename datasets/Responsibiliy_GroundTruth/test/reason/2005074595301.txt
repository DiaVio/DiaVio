The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without stopping and began a left turn to head north, failing to adequately surveil the intersection and failing to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by a conversation with a child in the back seat and was fatigued, which further contributed to the inadequate surveillance and inattention.
