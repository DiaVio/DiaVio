The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield right of way to northbound traffic. The driver of V1 mistakenly believed that they had a green arrow and did not have to yield to oncoming traffic. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to properly observe and assess the traffic situation before making the left turn.
