The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right of travel lane." Additionally, the critical reason for this event was coded as a physical impairment of the ability to act, due to the driver's history of convulsions and seizures. The witness behind V2 reported seeing V2 swerving before the crash and had even called the police to report a drunk driver. Furthermore, the medical report for V2's driver mentioned a sudden sensation of multiple lights flashing and waking up in the back of an ambulance, indicating a possible seizure or medical episode. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V2's impaired ability to act and potential medical condition likely contributed to the accident, making V2 primarily responsible.
