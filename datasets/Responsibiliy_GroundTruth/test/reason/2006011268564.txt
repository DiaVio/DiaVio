The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was inattentive and traveled over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, causing the collision with V2. The driver of V1 did not see V2 and took no avoidance actions, indicating a lack of attention to the road and surrounding vehicles. Additionally, the contributing factor of driver fatigue, due to the driver's extended work shifts and rotating sleep schedule, further supports V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
