The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection without having enough time to clear it, misjudging the gap or the speed of V1. This driver's inexperience, having only nine months of driving experience and recently completing a driver education course, contributed to the misjudgment. Additionally, V2 accelerated in an attempt to avoid the crash, which further indicates a lack of proper judgment and decision-making. V1 (the driver of the Nissan Sentra) attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes, indicating that they were aware of V2 entering the intersection and took appropriate action. However, V1's speed was also mentioned as an associated factor in the crash, suggesting that they may have been traveling at a speed that made it difficult to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their misjudgment of the gap or other's speed and their inexperience as a driver.
