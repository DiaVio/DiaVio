The driver of V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the northbound roadway and turned in front of V2, causing the collision. The driver of V1 stated that she had a green light, but there were no witnesses to confirm this. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver did not adequately check for oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
