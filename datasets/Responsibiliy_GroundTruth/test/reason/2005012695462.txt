The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn onto the southbound lanes of the roadway and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before initiating the turn. The driver of V1 stated that he looked to the right and then left, but did not see V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Tracker) in lane 2. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 was traveling north in lane 2 and had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 starting to move forward from the stop sign, but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
