Reason: The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted and looking down to get his coffee, resulting in a recognition error and inadequate surveillance. He failed to look far enough ahead to see the traffic slowing down, which ultimately led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 may have been fatigued, as he had been awake for over 4 1/2 hours and had only gotten 6 hours of sleep the night before. The presence of an open package of an over-the-counter stimulant in the vehicle suggests that the driver may have been using it, potentially affecting his alertness and reaction time. The worn-out tire on the left front of Vehicle #1 could also be considered a contributing factor.
