The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a left turn at the intersection without adequately surveying the road ahead. The driver stated that her view of V2 was obstructed by a van that was turning left in front of her. However, despite not having a clear view of V2, she proceeded with her left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1999 Jeep Cherokee) also shares some responsibility as she did not see V1 until she was halfway through the intersection. However, V2's failure to see V1 can be attributed to the obstructed view caused by the van, which turned in front of V1. Additionally, V2 stated that she applied the brakes but could not avoid the collision, indicating that she made an attempt to avoid the accident. Overall, V1's failure to adequately survey the road and proceed with a left turn without a clear view of oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
