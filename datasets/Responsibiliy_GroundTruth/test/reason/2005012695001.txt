The driver of V1 admitted to traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and tapped his brakes, causing the vehicle to fishtail and lose control. This resulted in V1 rotating into the oncoming lanes of travel and colliding with V3. After the impact with V3, V1 rotated back into the southbound lane and collided with V2. V2, on the other hand, took appropriate avoidance actions by attempting to slow down further when he noticed V1 losing control. Therefore, V2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed for the road conditions, which led to the loss of control and subsequent collisions.
