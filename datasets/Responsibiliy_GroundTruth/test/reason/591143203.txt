The driver of V1 abruptly steered the vehicle left for unknown reasons, causing it to enter into an ever-increasing counterclockwise yaw. This sudden maneuver resulted in V1 crossing into the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), a Toyota Camry sedan traveling in the adjacent lane. V2 collided with the left side of V1, and as the vehicles separated, V1 continued its counterclockwise rotation and struck the left front of V2. The driver of V1's abrupt steering and failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the collision with V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of V1.
