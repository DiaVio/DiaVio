The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for a traffic signal, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver of V1 claimed to have a green light, but this contradicts the statement from the driver of V2, who stated that they were stopped at a red light and proceeded into the intersection when it changed. Additionally, V1's driver stated that he never saw V2, indicating a lack of awareness and attention on his part. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
