The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound on the intersecting road and failed to stop at the stop sign controlling the intersection. As a result, V2 entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to the northbound case vehicle. The collision occurred when the front end of the case vehicle struck the right side of the tractor portion of V2. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to the case vehicle makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
