The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before entering the intersection. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2 until he was already in the intersection, indicating a failure to properly check for oncoming vehicles. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 was eating while driving suggests a distraction that may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance and ultimately the collision.
