The driver of V1 was fatigued and fell asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle drifting off the right side of the road. Although the driver briefly woke up when the vehicle went over a curb, they were unable to regain control and ended up overcorrecting, causing the vehicle to depart the left side of the road and ultimately roll over. The driver's drowsiness and lack of control were the main factors that contributed to the crash.
