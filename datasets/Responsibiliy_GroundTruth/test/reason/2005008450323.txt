The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of approximately 97kmph (60mph) on a wet and slippery curved roadway, which was above the speed limit of 56kmph (35mph). This indicates that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, resulting in the vehicle running off the road, colliding with a parked car, and ultimately crashing into a house. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was also 97kmph, indicating that the driver was not able to control the vehicle properly while negotiating the curve and failed to adjust their speed accordingly. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to travel at an excessive speed for the wet and slippery conditions of the roadway.
