The driver of V1 admitted to changing lanes without properly checking his blind spot and not seeing V2 (the 2006 Honda Element) in his side mirror. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of approximately 75 mph in heavy traffic, which can be considered aggressive driving behavior. The driver's inexperience with the vehicle and possible fatigue from working long hours may have also contributed to the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that she was traveling at a slightly lower speed of 71-72 mph and noticed V1 changing lanes. She mentioned that she may have been in V1's blind spot when the collision occurred. While V2 may have contributed to the accident by overcorrecting her steering, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for initiating the lane change without proper surveillance. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance, aggressive driving behavior, excessive speed in heavy traffic, and possible fatigue.
