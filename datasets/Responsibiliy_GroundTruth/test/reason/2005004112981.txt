The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the roadway, specifically failing to look for the deer crossing the roadway. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical precrash event being "inadequate surveillance, failed to look." Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to observe and react to the presence of the deer on the roadway.
