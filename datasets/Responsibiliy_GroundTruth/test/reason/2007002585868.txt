The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a driver performance error by attempting to change lanes without properly assessing the number of lanes on the roadway. The driver stated that he thought there were three lanes and attempted to pass the tractor-trailer by going into what he thought was the "center" lane. However, when he realized there were only two lanes, he braked and steered right, causing him to lose control of the vehicle and depart the roadway. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and failure to properly assess the roadway conditions before changing lanes.
