The driver of V2 attempted to turn right at the intersection but failed to adequately survey the traffic and did not look or see V1 approaching in the first lane. Additionally, the driver of V2 changed lanes to the left, straddling the left turn lane and the second through lane, which further contributed to the collision. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and improper lane change are the main factors that led to the accident.
