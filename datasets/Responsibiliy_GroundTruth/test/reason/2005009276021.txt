The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was attempting to make a left turn onto the northbound roadway from the eastbound lane. V2 (the 2004 Ford Expedition) was traveling northbound on the divided highway in lane three, which indicates that V2 had the right of way. V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, the lack of an interview with the driver of V1 prevents further information about their actions or potential errors from being known. However, based on the available information, V1's failure to yield and make a safe left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
