The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the Chevrolet Impala) when V2 was stopped at the T-intersection preparing to turn left. V1's driver admitted to being distracted by reading directions while driving and looking down to read the next turn. This distraction caused her to not notice that V2 had stopped in front of her until it was too late to brake and avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's driver was not familiar with the area, which may have contributed to her reliance on directions and increased the likelihood of being distracted while driving. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and attention to the road makes her primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
