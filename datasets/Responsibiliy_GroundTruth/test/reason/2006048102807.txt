The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was distracted by an internal factor, specifically dropping something and trying to retrieve it from the floorboard. This distraction caused V1 to depart from the travel lane and enter the median, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, having only slept for about three hours the night before. Fatigue is considered a factor that impairs driving ability and can lead to decreased alertness and reaction time. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and fatigue, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
