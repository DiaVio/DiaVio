The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn on a green arrow but failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver was distracted by putting up her hair and did not fully finish before the light turned green. She looked left and right but did not see any vehicles, leading to a failure to notice V2 approaching from the southbound direction. This inadequate surveillance and recognition error by the driver of V1 resulted in the collision with V2.
