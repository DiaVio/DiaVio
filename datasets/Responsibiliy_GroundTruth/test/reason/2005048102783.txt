The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one made a lane change maneuver without adequately surveilling the traffic ahead. Despite looking behind her with the side mirror, she failed to notice the stopped traffic in lane four, which resulted in the front of her vehicle impacting the rear of Vehicle two (the 2004 Chevrolet Impala). This recognition error and inadequate surveillance by the driver of Vehicle one led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
