The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, but failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she did not remember seeing the other vehicle approaching when she attempted to make the turn. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surrounding traffic. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event coded to V1 was "inadequate surveillance - looked but did not see." This further supports the conclusion that V1 failed to properly observe the oncoming vehicle. While V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) did encroach into the left lane, it is important to note that V1 had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic when making a left turn. V2 stated that she noticed V1 turning across her travel path at the last instant and attempted to brake, but there was not enough room to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way when making a left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
