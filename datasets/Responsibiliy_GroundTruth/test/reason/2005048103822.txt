The reason for this is inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the fact that the driver of V1 was looking to the right and failed to clear the traffic to the left before making the left turn at the intersection. This lack of proper observation and failure to ensure a safe turn contributed to the collision with V2 (the Chevrolet K1500) and subsequently with V3 (the Kenworth 800 dump truck).
