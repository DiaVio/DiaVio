The reason for this determination is that the injuries sustained by the driver, such as brain stem transection, atlanto-occipital dislocation, aorta transection, rib fractures, liver and spleen lacerations, central pubic symphysis fracture, open tibia and fibula fractures, scrotal laceration, toe lacerations, metatarsal fractures, and lip laceration, are all attributed to the driver's contact with various parts of the vehicle during the collision. This suggests that the driver's actions or lack of proper restraint (unbelted) contributed significantly to the severity of the injuries.
