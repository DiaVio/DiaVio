The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was under the influence of alcohol, which impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the observations and comments of the investigating officer. These factors, combined with the driver's overcompensation when the vehicle exited the left shoulder, ultimately led to the rollover crash.
