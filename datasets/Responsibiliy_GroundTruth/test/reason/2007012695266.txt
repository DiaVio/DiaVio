The driver of V1 attempted to turn left at the intersection without realizing that he did not have the right-of-way. He was distracted by focusing on the car ahead of him instead of the roadway. This external distraction caused him to not see V2 (the Ford Escape) until it was already in his path. Although V2 did tap her brakes upon seeing the vehicle ahead of V1 turning, she could not avoid contacting V1 due to the sudden appearance of V1 in her path. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right-of-way and his distraction from the roadway make him primarily responsible for the accident.
