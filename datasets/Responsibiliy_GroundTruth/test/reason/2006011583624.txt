The driver of V1 made a decision error by attempting to turn left into the entrance from the right lane, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 in her blind spot contributed to the collision. Other factors such as her unfamiliarity with the road and lack of driving experience in the country may have also played a role.
