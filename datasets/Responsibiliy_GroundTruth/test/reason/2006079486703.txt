The reason for this is that V2 was encroaching into the left lane of opposing traffic, which resulted in the collision with V1 (the 1992 Toyota Corolla) as it was making a left turn. V2's encroachment into the left lane indicates a failure to maintain their lane and exercise caution while approaching the intersection.
