The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V2, which caused V1 to catch up with V2 quickly. - V1 attempted to avoid V2 by steering left at the last second, indicating poor directional control. - The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, with a BAC level of 0.171, which impaired their ability to drive safely. - V1's driver also had a hearing impairment, which may have further affected their ability to perceive and react to the situation. Overall, V1's excessive speed, poor directional control, impaired state due to alcohol, and hearing impairment contributed to their responsibility for the accident.
