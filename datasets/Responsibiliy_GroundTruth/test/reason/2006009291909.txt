The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to notice the unoccupied V2 (the 2001 Toyota Corolla) in lane one ahead of her. Despite the lights of V2 being off, the driver of V1 should have been attentive to the vehicles in front of her. Additionally, when the driver of V1 finally noticed V2, she applied her brakes, which locked up and caused her to skid into V2. This indicates a lack of proper control and braking technique. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was unable to steer to the left due to traffic congestion in lane two and unable to steer to the right due to the merge lane bordering her. This suggests a failure to maintain proper lane position and adapt to the traffic conditions. Overall, the driver of V1's inadequate surveillance, distraction from the vehicles merging from the off-ramp, and failure to react appropriately to the presence of V2 make her primarily responsible for the accident.
