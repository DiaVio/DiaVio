The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not focused on the road. The driver admitted to looking outside unfocused, just watching the road go by. This external distraction likely caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle while negotiating the right-hand curve, resulting in V1 departing the roadway and overcorrecting back onto the road, ultimately colliding with the rear of V2. While V2 (the driver of the 1986 Jeep Wagoneer) was stopped and waiting for the vehicle in front to make a left turn, V1's distraction and subsequent loss of control were the critical factors that led to the accident. Therefore, V1 bears the primary responsibility for the collision.
