The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it ran off the left side of the road and traveled into a grassy area, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. The yawing marks in the grass also suggest that the driver attempted to correct the vehicle's path but was unsuccessful. The impact with the tree on the left side further confirms the driver's inability to maintain control.
