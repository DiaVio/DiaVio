The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the intersection, facing west, waiting to make a left turn. V2, on the other hand, was traveling north in lane one on the intersecting roadway. V1 began to turn left as V2 entered the intersection, resulting in the front of V2 impacting the left side of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, causing the collision.
