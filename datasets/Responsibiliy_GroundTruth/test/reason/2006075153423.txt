The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 (the 1996 Chrysler Cirrus) and subsequently collided with the rear of V2. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to react in a timely manner to the slowing vehicle ahead. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that the brakes did not stop the vehicle, suggesting a possible mechanical issue or lack of proper maintenance. It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that their vehicle is in proper working condition before operating it on the road. Overall, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and potential brake failure contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
