The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right-of-way to V1 (the Crown Victoria) at the intersection. V2 attempted to cross the intersection with an obstructed view due to illegally parked vehicles and eight-foot tall hedges, which blocked their view of V1. This decision to cross the intersection without a clear view and without yielding to oncoming traffic led to the collision between V1 and V2.
