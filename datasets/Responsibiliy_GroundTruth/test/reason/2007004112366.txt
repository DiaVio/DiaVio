The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of the non-contact vehicle (landscaping vehicle) that suddenly stopped. V1 was unable to stop in time and subsequently struck the rear of V2 (the Honda CRV). Although V2 also came to a sudden stop due to the actions of the landscaping vehicle, V1 is considered primarily responsible because they were following too closely and traveling at a speed that did not allow them to react in time to the sudden stop.
