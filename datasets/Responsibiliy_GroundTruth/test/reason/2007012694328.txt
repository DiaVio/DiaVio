The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she turned left at the intersection with an obstructed view. She stated that she could not properly see around the large SUV in the opposing lane, which prevented her from accurately assessing the oncoming traffic. Despite not having a clear view, she proceeded to turn left when she thought all the westbound vehicles had cleared the intersection. This decision resulted in a collision with V2 (the 1999 Chevrolet express van) that was traveling in the first westbound lane. While V2 may have encroached over the left lane line, the critical reason for the accident was not coded to this vehicle. V2's driver admitted to being distracted and thinking about her son's illness and her home situation, but this does not absolve V1 of her responsibility for turning left without a clear view. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to turning left with an obstructed view, which resulted in the collision with V2.
