The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed while negotiating a curve to the right. It crossed over the centerline into the westbound lane, struck a steel guardrail, and then continued to rotate clockwise before sliding off the roadway and impacting a large rock on an embankment. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, likely due to excessive speed while navigating the curve.
