The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed their vehicle to cross the median into the eastbound travel lanes, directly into the path of Vehicles 2 and 3. This action caused the head-on collision between Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2, resulting in moderately severe damage to both vehicles. The driver of Vehicle 1 also sustained serious injuries, indicating a higher level of responsibility for the accident.
