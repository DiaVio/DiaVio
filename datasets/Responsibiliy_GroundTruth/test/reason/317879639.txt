The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the traffic signal and then began to accelerate and enter the intersection, presumably without yielding the right of way to V2 (the 2004 Ford FreeStar) which was already traveling south in lane two of the southbound lanes. This indicates that V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and yield when necessary, resulting in the collision.
