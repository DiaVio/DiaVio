The reason for this is that V2 crossed the centerline and struck V1 while V1 was negotiating a curve. V2's actions of losing control of the vehicle, panicking, and slamming on the brakes caused the collision. Additionally, V2 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions and was distracted by looking for a street address, which contributed to the crash. V2's unfamiliarity with the area and lack of a navigator also played a role in the accident.
