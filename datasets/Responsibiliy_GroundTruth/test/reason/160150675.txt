The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1997 Ford F150 pickup truck, which was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's failure to yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1 rotated clockwise post-impact, indicating that it was the vehicle that was struck on its left side. This further supports V1's primary responsibility as the turning vehicle is typically expected to yield to oncoming traffic. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the side impact crash.
