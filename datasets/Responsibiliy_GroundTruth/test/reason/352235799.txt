The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control while negotiating the left turning curve. This loss of control led to over-steering, causing the vehicle to rotate clockwise and ultimately depart from the roadway. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent it from striking the curb and utility pole indicates that Vehicle 1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
