The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that she pulled the vehicle to the right side of the lane and then got pulled farther right by snow. She then applied full ABS and overcorrected to the left, causing her vehicle to depart the roadway and strike a tree. The critical reason for this event was slick roads due to the snow-covered roadway. Although the driver mentioned that she was unprepared for the change in road conditions, it is still her responsibility to adjust her driving behavior and maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
