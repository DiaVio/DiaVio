The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to take adequate evasive action when she realized that V1 was stopping. Despite attempting to change lanes to the right, she found that the lane was not clear. Instead of braking in a timely manner, she applied the brakes and steered to the left at the last minute, resulting in the collision with the back of V1. This inadequate evasive action, combined with the driver's distraction of talking to her passenger, led to the accident.
