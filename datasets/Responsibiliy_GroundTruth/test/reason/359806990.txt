The reason for this is that V2 was approaching the intersection in the westbound lane and began to lock up the brakes and swerve to the left, departing the lane slightly to the left. As a result, the front of V2 impacted the left side of V1 in the middle of the intersection, causing V1 to roll and come to rest on its right side in the grassy ditch. Additionally, the boat being pulled by V2 came off the trailer and slid west in the eastbound lane. Therefore, V2's actions of locking up the brakes, swerving, and impacting V1 directly contributed to the accident and the subsequent injuries sustained by the driver of V1.
