The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted speed limit and crossed the center line, resulting in a head-on collision with V3. This initial collision caused V3 to rotate and come to rest on the south side of the road. V2 then continued forward and struck V1 in the left door, causing both vehicles to leave the roadway and come to rest on a private driveway. Therefore, the actions of V2, including speeding and crossing the center line, directly led to the chain of events that resulted in the accident.
