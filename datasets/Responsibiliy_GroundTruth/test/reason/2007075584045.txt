The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the State Trooper's lights activated on the northbound side, which caused him to become nervous and lose focus on the road. This distraction led to V1 departing into the left shoulder where the vehicle lost traction in loose gravel. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation and traveling too fast on a curve, combined with being an inexperienced driver, further contributed to the accident.
