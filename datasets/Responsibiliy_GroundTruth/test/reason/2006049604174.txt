The front of V2 impacted the right side of V1 (the 2000 Dodge Ram pick-up truck), indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, V2 rotated clockwise and moved into the westbound lanes, suggesting that V2 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle after the impact. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and loss of control are the reasons for V2's primary responsibility in this crash.
