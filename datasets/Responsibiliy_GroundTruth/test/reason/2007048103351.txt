The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. Even though the driver of V2 (the 1991 Mercury Grand Marquis) stated that he thought V1 would yield the right-of-way, it is ultimately the responsibility of the turning vehicle (V1) to ensure it is safe to make the turn. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown," indicating that there was some error on the part of the driver of V1. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
