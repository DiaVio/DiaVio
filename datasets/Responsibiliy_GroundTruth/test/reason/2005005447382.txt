The reason for this is as follows: - Two witnesses reported that V1 had a red light while V2 had a green turn arrow, indicating that V1 ran a red light. - The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as an illegal maneuver (running a red light). - The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and stated that he had been thinking about some concerns he had, work stress, and aggressive driving. - There were also indications that the driver of V1 may have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol, although this was not confirmed through testing. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to running a red light and engaging in aggressive and inattentive driving behavior.
