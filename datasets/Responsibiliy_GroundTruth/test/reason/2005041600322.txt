The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 lost control and made impact with the left concrete barrier, causing the car to rotate and come to rest facing northbound. The critical precrash event was a tire blowout or flat tire, which resulted in the vehicle wobbling and shaking, ultimately leading to the loss of control. The tire malfunction on the left rear tire caused the vehicle to pull to the left before impacting the barrier. The fact that the tire had completely separated from the rim and there were clear gouge marks on the roadway supports this conclusion.
