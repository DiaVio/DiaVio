The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1988 Ford Thunderbird). The driver of V1 misjudged the velocity of oncoming traffic on the arterial road and did not properly assess the situation before proceeding. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, which may have contributed to the misjudgment. While the driver of V2 falsely assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to stop and yield at the stop sign.
