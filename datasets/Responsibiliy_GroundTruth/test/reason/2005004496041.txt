The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not look far enough ahead. This is evident from the fact that V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2 (the 2003 Nissan Altima sedan) while V2 was decelerating for the amber traffic control signal. Additionally, V1 was traveling between 50-64 KMPH (31-40 MPH), which indicates that the driver was not able to slow down or stop in a timely manner. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and inability to stop in time make them primarily responsible for the accident.
