The driver of V1 admitted to taking Percocet and drinking alcohol prior to the crash, and blood tests confirmed the presence of drugs and alcohol in his system. Additionally, the driver's medical history includes asthma and kidney stones, which may have impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. The physical evidence also shows that V1 was in a yaw with the left side leading as it ran off the left side of the roadway, indicating driver error or overcompensation. Therefore, the driver's impaired state and overcompensation are the primary reasons for the accident.
