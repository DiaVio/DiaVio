The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted into the westbound travel lane, traveling east, while negotiating the curve. This caused a collision with Vehicle 1, which was traveling in the correct lane. The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to steer to the left and brake to avoid the collision, but the avoidance maneuver was unsuccessful. Vehicle 2's attempt to steer back to the right was also unsuccessful. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, by drifting into the wrong lane, ultimately led to the collision.
