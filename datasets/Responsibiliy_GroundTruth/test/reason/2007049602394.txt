The driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.159, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This indicates that the driver was impaired at the time of the accident. Additionally, V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, suggesting that the driver was not in control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impairment and the vehicle's departure from the roadway.
