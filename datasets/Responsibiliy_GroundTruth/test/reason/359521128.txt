The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, swiped the guard rail, and then swerved to the left, crossing over the opposite lane and departing the roadway to the left. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the frontal impact with the embankment and subsequent rollover.
