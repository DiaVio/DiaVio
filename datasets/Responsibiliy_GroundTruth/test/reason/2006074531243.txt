The driver of V1 admitted to several factors that contributed to the crash, including: 1. Drinking beer for more than four hours prior to the crash. 2. Smoking marijuana within the previous twenty-four hours. 3. Not taking prescribed medication for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. 4. Not sleeping for five days while in a mental hospital. 5. Traveling too fast for conditions. These factors indicate that the driver was impaired and not in a suitable physical or mental state to operate a vehicle safely. Additionally, the driver mentioned a recent tire replacement that may have affected the vehicle's handling. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired state, failure to take appropriate medication, and traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions.
