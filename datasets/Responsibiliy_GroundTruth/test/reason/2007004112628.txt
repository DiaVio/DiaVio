The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. This is evident from the Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event being coded as "too fast for conditions-wet roads". Additionally, the driver attempted to brake and steer to avoid going off the roadway but was unsuccessful, indicating that the speed was a contributing factor to the loss of control.
