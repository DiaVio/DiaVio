The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and then entered the intersection to make a left turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver failed to adequately check for oncoming traffic before making the turn. This suggests that V1 did not see V2 approaching and therefore failed to yield the right of way. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Mercedes 300E) was traveling straight in the westbound lane and did not have any critical reasons or factors directly attributed to their actions. While V2 may have been unable to avoid the collision due to V1's failure to yield, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not properly surveilling the intersection before making the left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while making a left turn at the intersection.
