The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, crossing the path of Vehicle Two (V2), the 1997 Dodge Ram 3500 pickup truck, which was traveling straight in its lane. The contact between the right front of V1 and the front of V2 indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
