The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the posted stop sign and proceeded through the intersection without the right of way. This illegal maneuver directly led to the collision with V2 (the 1998 Chevrolet Malibu). V1's failure to obey traffic laws and yield the right of way resulted in the accident.
