The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it lost control while negotiating the curved on-ramp, departed the roadway to the left, and traveled up and over the median onto the freeway lanes. This action resulted in the collision with the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2011 Freightliner Cascadia.
