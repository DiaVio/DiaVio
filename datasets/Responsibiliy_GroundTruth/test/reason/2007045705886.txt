The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn from a stopped position in the westbound left turn lane, crossing the eastbound lanes of the arterial road. V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and did not see V2 (the Buick Electra Park Avenue) approaching in the right lane. As a result, V1 turned into the path of V2, causing the collision. Additionally, it is worth noting that V2 attempted to avoid the collision by leaving a skid mark, indicating that V2 had the right of way and was unable to avoid the collision due to V1's improper left turn maneuver.
