The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver changed lanes from lane two to lane one when the vehicles in front were not moving forward after the traffic signal turned green. This action of changing lanes without ensuring a clear path and without sufficient time for other vehicles to react resulted in V1 striking the left side of V2. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and encroaching into the path of V1 led to the collision.
