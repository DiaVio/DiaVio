The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 67 mph, which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 35 mph. Additionally, the driver admitted to traveling between 31-40 mph prior to the crash, which is still too fast for the icy road conditions. This decision to drive at an excessive speed for the conditions led to the loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately the collision with the utility pole. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
