The driver of V1 stated that she intended to turn left at the intersection and had stopped for a couple of seconds before proceeding. However, she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. She looked both ways but did not see V2 approaching from the north. This inadequate surveillance was the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1. Additionally, factors such as the use of prescription medications, a sightline restriction caused by a non-contact vehicle, and an "other" recognition error due to the traffic flow pattern also contributed to the driver's responsibility. While the driver of V2 admitted to traveling about 15 mph over the posted speed limit, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle. However, factors such as inattention, an "other" recognition error due to the traffic flow pattern, and a sightline restriction caused by a non-contact vehicle were associated with the driver of V2. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and other contributing factors.
