The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The road was wet due to heavy rainfall, and there were curve warning signs indicating a reduced speed limit. Despite these factors, V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), which was too fast for the wet road conditions and the curve. This excessive speed caused V1 to lose control, rotate clockwise, and ultimately exit the road, resulting in the crash.
