The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the distance and speed of the oncoming vehicle (V2) as she entered the intersection. Despite seeing V2, she proceeded with insufficient clearance and attempted to accelerate through the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, her impatience and the fact that her vehicle was relatively new may have contributed to her misjudgment and decision-making. V2, on the other hand, was driving within the speed limit and did not contribute to the crash. She tried to avoid the collision by swerving left and braking, but there was not enough time to prevent the impact. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to misjudgment, insufficient clearance, and impatience, while V2 did not contribute to the crash.
