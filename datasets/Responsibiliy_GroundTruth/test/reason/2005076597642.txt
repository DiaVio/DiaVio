The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they lost control of their vehicle due to hydroplaning on the wet road. This loss of control caused V1 to cross into the eastbound lanes, where they were subsequently struck by V2 (the driver of the 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche). While V2 was encroaching on the left lane line, this encroachment was a result of V1's loss of control and crossing into the eastbound lanes. Therefore, V1's hydroplaning and subsequent loss of control is the critical pre-crash event that led to the accident, making them primarily responsible.
