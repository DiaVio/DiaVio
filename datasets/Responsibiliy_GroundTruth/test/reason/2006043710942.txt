The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic. This is evident from the statement of the driver himself, who admitted to not stopping at the stop sign and claimed to have been looking out his side windows instead of paying attention to the road ahead. Additionally, V1's failure to stop is supported by the skid marks left by V2, indicating that V2 attempted to brake and avoid the collision. V2 (the Ford Escape) was traveling within the speed limit and had the right of way since there was no traffic control device on the northbound road. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, but was unable to do so due to V1's failure to yield. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and yield the right of way to V2.
