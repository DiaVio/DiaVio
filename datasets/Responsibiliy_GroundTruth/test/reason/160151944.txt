The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it attempted to make a left-hand turn at the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic. This resulted in the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2003 Dodge Dakota pickup truck, contacting the right side of V1, causing the collision. V1's failure to yield and properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the turn led to the accident.
