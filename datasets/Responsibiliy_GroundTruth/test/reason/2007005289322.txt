Reason: 1. The driver of V1 admitted to tailgating, which is a contributing factor to the crash. This indicates that V1 was following too closely to V2, making it difficult to respond to any unexpected actions. 2. The witness statement supports the fact that V1 was following too closely to V2, as the witness noticed that V1 was going to hit V2. 3. The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 indicates that V1 was decelerating while in the same lane as V2, further suggesting that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance. Overall, V1's tailgating behavior and failure to maintain a safe distance from V2 are the primary reasons for the rear-end crash.
