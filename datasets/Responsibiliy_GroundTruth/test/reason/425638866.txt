The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection intending to turn left across the path of V1, the 2013 Honda Civic sedan. V1 attempted to avoid colliding with V2 by steering left and then right, but ultimately the front of V1 impacted the front of V2 in a full frontal configuration. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
