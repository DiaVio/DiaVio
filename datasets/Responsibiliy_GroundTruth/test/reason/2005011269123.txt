The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was observed weaving back and forth across the lanes, leaving the road on the right and crossing the centerline onto the left shoulder. - V1 was driving below the posted speed limit and exhibiting erratic behavior. - After a vehicle passed V1 on the left, V1 accelerated and continued to weave, driving above the speed limit. - Witnesses were on a cell phone with emergency personnel to report V1's actions when they caught back up to V1, just as it struck V2 in the westbound lane. - The Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." - The Critical Reason for the Critical Event coded to V1 was "other decision error," which was related to the driver's impaired ability due to a medically reported blood alcohol level of .21. Therefore, V1's impaired driving, as indicated by the high blood alcohol level, erratic behavior, and failure to maintain lane position, makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
