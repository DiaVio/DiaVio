The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before entering the roadway. The driver stated that the stop sign was placed far back from the roadway, making it difficult to see around the hillside. Despite creeping up towards the roadway multiple times and looking in both directions for traffic, the driver did not see V2 approaching and entered the roadway without proper visibility. Additionally, the driver of V1 is described as inexperienced, with only one year of driving history, which may have contributed to their confusion in this situation. On the other hand, V2 (the 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was traveling southbound and had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 stopped at the stop sign and V1 suddenly pulled out in front of her. She braked heavily but was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
