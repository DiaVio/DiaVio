The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was making a left turn from the number-one left turn lane, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2002 Toyota Tundra pickup, which was traveling straight through in the number-three lane. V2's driver observed V1's movement and applied the brakes, leaving locked wheel tire marks, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. However, V1's left turn brought it into the path of V2, resulting in the impact. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
