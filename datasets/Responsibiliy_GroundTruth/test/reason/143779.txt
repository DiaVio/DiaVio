The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in it departing the road, tripping over the right wheels, and ultimately colliding with a large tree. The driver's loss of control and failure to maintain the vehicle on the road contributed to the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not using the available three-point seat belt further indicates negligence on their part.
