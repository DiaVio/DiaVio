The critical reason for the accident was coded to V1 as a driver-related factor: inattention, daydreaming, thinking about boyfriend, and appointment. This indicates that V1 was not paying attention to the road and was distracted by personal thoughts and concerns. Additionally, it is mentioned that sightline restriction played a small role in the collision, with vehicles parked alongside the south curb of the southeast corner of the intersection hindering the visibility of both drivers. However, this factor alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility, as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure a safe and clear path before proceeding through an intersection. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to observe the traffic signal and the presence of V2 resulted in the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
