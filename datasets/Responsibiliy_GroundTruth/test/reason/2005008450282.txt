The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which indicates that it encroached into the opposite lane of traffic. This encroachment led to the collision with Vehicle 1. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle 2 was in a hurry and an inexperienced driver, which may have contributed to his inability to properly negotiate the curve and stay within his lane. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to its encroachment into the opposite lane and the driver's inexperience and haste.
