The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1, the oncoming vehicle, had the right of way as it was going straight through the intersection. V2 failed to yield to V1 and turned in front of it, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 could not be reached for an interview, so there is no additional information to suggest any other factors that may have contributed to the accident.
