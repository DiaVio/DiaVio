The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the left curve. Instead of staying on the roadway, V1 veered off the right road edge and onto the narrow gravel shoulder. This action ultimately led to the vehicle launching off the embankment, rolling over, and coming to rest in a field. The driver's perception of an oncoming vehicle encroaching into her lane may have caused her to panic and overreact, resulting in the loss of control. However, it is the driver's responsibility to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, regardless of any perceived encroachment. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control and stay on the roadway.
