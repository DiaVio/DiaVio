The driver of V1 admitted to intentionally running the red light and attempting to avoid a collision by applying brakes and steering right, but was unsuccessful in avoiding the collision with V2. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic signal and made an illegal maneuver, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "Other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path," further supporting V1's responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, V2 was stopped at the intersection and proceeded through when the light turned green, indicating that V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their intentional violation of the traffic signal and failure to avoid the collision.
