The reason for this is that V2 drove off the north edge of the road, attempted to return to the roadway, but lost control of the vehicle. As a result, V2 crossed the center line and entered the path of the case vehicle, a 2001 Mitsubishi Galant sedan, causing a front-to-front impact. The driver of the case vehicle attempted to avoid the impact by braking and veering right, as evidenced by the gouge mark near the eastbound lane fog line. Therefore, V2's actions of driving off the road, losing control, and crossing the center line directly contributed to the accident.
