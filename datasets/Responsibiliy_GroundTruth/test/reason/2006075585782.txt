The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling: turning left at intersection." This indicates that vehicle one was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. However, vehicle one failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle two (2003 Toyota Highlander) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction-over left lane line." This suggests that vehicle two encroached into the left lane of vehicle one, but it is not coded to be primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic while making a left turn at the intersection.
