The driver of V1 admitted to entering the intersection on a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.09, which is above the legal limit in many jurisdictions. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not following traffic laws and was impaired at the time of the crash. V2 (the driver of the white Chrysler Sebring) was traveling on a green light and it is indicated that she was able to steer right just before the impact occurred. This suggests that V2 was following traffic laws and taking appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their illegal maneuver and impaired driving.
