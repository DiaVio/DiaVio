The driver of V1 stated that she checked the cross street to both the left and right but did not see any other vehicles approaching. This indicates that she failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event of V1 was attributed to inadequate surveillance, which suggests that the driver of V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming V2 (2002 Hyundai Santa Fe). Since V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
