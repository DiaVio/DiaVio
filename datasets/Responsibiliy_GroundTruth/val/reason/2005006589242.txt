The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the Toyota Camry) before proceeding through the intersection. V1 stated that he believed he made eye contact with V2 and assumed she was going to let him go first. However, V1 did not proceed at a speed that would have allowed him to respond to V2's actions. Additionally, V1 admitted to being a somewhat reckless driver and having been in previous crashes. This suggests a lack of caution and responsibility on the part of V1. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to proceed at an appropriate speed make him primarily responsible for the crash.
