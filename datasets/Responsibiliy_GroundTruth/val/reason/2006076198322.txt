The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted internally, specifically by trying to locate the dome light switch to check his speedometer. This distraction caused V1 to veer off the edge of the road on the right side, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's suspended license and inconsistent sleep patterns indicate a lack of responsibility and proper preparation for driving.
