The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the police officer failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the right turn. The critical reason for the critical event (turning right at the intersection) was coded as inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see). This means that V1 did not properly assess the situation and failed to notice V2 approaching in the adjacent lane, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and ensure the intersection was clear before making the right turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
