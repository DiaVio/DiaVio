The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit (64 kmph or 40 mph) when approaching the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event being "inadequate surveillance." This suggests that the driver of V1 did not properly look or failed to see V2 approaching from the southbound lane. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to properly observe the intersection make them primarily responsible for the accident.
