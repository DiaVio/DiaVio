The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. V2 stated that she looked but did not see the other vehicle (V1) approaching, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2 was using prescription medications for heart and blood problems, which may have affected her ability to perceive and react to the situation accurately.
