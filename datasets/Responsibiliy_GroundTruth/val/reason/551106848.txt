The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver locked up the brakes and made an end departure, resulting in the front of V1 impacting into an embankment. This suggests that the driver lost control of the vehicle, potentially due to excessive speed or failure to properly navigate the intersection. Additionally, both the driver and the front right passenger were not wearing seatbelts, which could have contributed to the severity of their injuries.
