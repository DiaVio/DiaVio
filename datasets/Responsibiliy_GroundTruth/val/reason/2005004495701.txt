The driver of V1 was found to be asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver's lack of recollection and the fact that the vehicle veered off the left side of the road indicate that the driver was not in control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway may have contributed to the incident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's negligence in falling asleep while driving.
