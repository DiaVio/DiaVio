The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made the decision to pass the vehicles stopped in her lane by entering the center-turn lane. This action was not appropriate or legal, as the center-turn lane is intended for turning, not for passing. Additionally, V1 failed to yield the right-of-way to Vehicle 2 (V2), which was turning left into the eastbound lane from a gas station parking lot. Although V2's driver received a citation for not having a driver's license and for a safe movement violation, the primary responsibility lies with V1 because her decision to pass in the center-turn lane and failure to yield the right-of-way were the immediate causes of the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her improper use of the center-turn lane and failure to yield the right-of-way to V2.
