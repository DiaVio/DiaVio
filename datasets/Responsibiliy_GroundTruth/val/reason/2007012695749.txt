The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to not seeing the red light and not seeing V2 until she was already in the intersection. This indicates a failure to properly observe and react to the traffic signals and the presence of other vehicles. Additionally, V1 was distracted by looking for a particular road, which further contributed to the driver's failure to notice the red light and V2. V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Venture minivan) had a green light and attempted to steer left and accelerate to avoid the collision, indicating that V2 was following the traffic rules and taking evasive action. V2's false assumption that V1 would yield the right-of-way does not absolve V1 of responsibility, as V1's failure to stop for the traffic signal and failure to observe V2's presence were the primary causes of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to driver-related errors, including failure to observe the red light, inadequate surveillance, distraction, and unfamiliarity with the roadway.
