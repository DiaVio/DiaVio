The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to properly interpret the traffic control devices at the intersection. Despite the flashing red beacon, stop sign, and the sign indicating that crossroad traffic does not stop, V1 proceeded to cross the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. Additionally, the driver's lack of familiarity with the roadway and the distraction of talking on her cell phone contributed to her failure to properly assess the situation. V2 (the driver of the 2005 International straight truck) attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering to the left, indicating that he took appropriate evasive action. Therefore, V2's actions do not contribute significantly to the cause of the crash.
