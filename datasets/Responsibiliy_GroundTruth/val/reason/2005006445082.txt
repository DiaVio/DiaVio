The reason for this is that V2 pulled out of a parking lot onto the northbound lane without looking in either direction or making a full stop at the stop sign while exiting the parking lot. This careless action by the driver of V2 resulted in V1 being unable to stop in time and colliding with the left side of V2. The eyewitness account also supports this, stating that V2 pulled out at a speed of about 10-15 mph. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
