The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost consciousness while driving, resulting in the front of V1 striking the back of V2. The driver of V1 had not been feeling well and had taken prescribed insulin and additional daily medications for her diabetic condition, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which she had not taken since the prior morning. The critical reason for the critical event coded for V1 was a critical non-performance due to other physical impairment, specifically a diabetic-related blackout. Additionally, V1 was cited for failure to stop in assured clear distance ahead, indicating that the driver of V1 did not maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which led to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo) had been stopped at a red light and had just accelerated to 10mph when V1 struck V2. The driver of V2 had no chance to avoid the crash and was not found to have any contributing or associated factors coded. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's loss of consciousness and failure to maintain a safe distance.
