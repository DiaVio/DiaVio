The reason for this is that V1 crossed the lane line on the right and struck V2 (the 2000 Toyota Camry) from behind. This is supported by the vehicle damage and the statements of the driver. Additionally, witness #1 and #2 did not see V1 before the collision, indicating that V1's actions were the cause of the accident.
