The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver was distracted by a phone call from her alarm company, which caused her to not notice that V2 (the disabled Mercedes 380) was stopped in front of her until it was too late. Additionally, the driver admitted to being anxious and having a bad previous twenty-four hours, which may have further contributed to her lack of attention on the road. V2, on the other hand, was disabled and had its hazard lights flashing, indicating that it was not able to move. While the driver of V2 was talking on his cell phone at the time of the crash, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility as the driver should have been paying attention to the road and noticed the stopped vehicle ahead. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to driver distraction and failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead.
