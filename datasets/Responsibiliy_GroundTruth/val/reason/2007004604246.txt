The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1, a 36-year-old male, stated that he was responding to an emergency call and entered the intersection after coming to a complete stop. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2002 Mercedes C240). Additionally, an associated factor of "in a hurry" was coded for V1, indicating that the driver was rushing to the emergency call. This may have contributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and the associated factor of being in a hurry.
