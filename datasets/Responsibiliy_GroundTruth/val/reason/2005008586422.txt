The reason for Vehicle 2 being primarily responsible is inadequate surveillance by the driver. Vehicle 2 initiated a left U-turn across the path of Vehicle 1, encroaching into the left lane line without properly observing the oncoming traffic. This action resulted in the collision between the front of Vehicle 1 and the left rear of Vehicle 2.
