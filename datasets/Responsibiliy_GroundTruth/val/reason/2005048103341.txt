The reason for V1's responsibility is that they made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 stated that they thought V2 was going to stop when the light turned yellow, and therefore started to turn left. However, V2 proceeded straight through the intersection, resulting in the collision. V1's decision to turn left without ensuring that it was safe to do so, and without confirming V2's intentions, led to the accident.
