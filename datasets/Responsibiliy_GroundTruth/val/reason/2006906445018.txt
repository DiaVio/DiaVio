The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and inexperienced. The driver admitted to talking with her passenger and using her handheld cell phone while driving. Additionally, she had just failed her driver's licensing exam for the second time and had not driven for at least eight years prior to the crash. These factors indicate a lack of focus and experience, which likely contributed to her loss of control and drifting off the road.
