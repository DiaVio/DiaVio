The reason for this is that V1 entered a clockwise rotation and crossed into the number one lane, ultimately colliding with V2 (the 2006 Nissan Altima sedan). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, V1's driver's statement about being drunk suggests a possible impairment, which could have contributed to the loss of control and the subsequent collision.
