The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 72 kph (45 mph) and failed to negotiate the sharp left curve. The driver of V1 braked and began skidding, ultimately losing control of the vehicle and skidding off the roadway into a ditch. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to adjust their speed or take appropriate measures to navigate the curve safely.
