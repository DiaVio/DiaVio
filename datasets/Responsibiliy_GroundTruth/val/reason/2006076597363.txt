The driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on a steep downhill curved roadway approaching a narrow bridge. The driver failed to reduce her speed accordingly, despite the presence of warning signs for the curve and narrow bridge. Additionally, the driver was distracted by conversing with her passenger and only became aware of the approaching bridge when verbally warned by the other occupant.
