The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to the deep mud on the wet and muddy road. This caused V1 to depart the road, resulting in a collision with a tree and an electric fence. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle in these conditions indicates negligence on their part. Additionally, the driver was not using the available three-point seat belt, which could have mitigated the severity of the injuries sustained.
