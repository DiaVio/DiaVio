The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was stopped on the shoulder of the southbound roadway and then entered the travel lanes without yielding to oncoming traffic. Vehicle 1 then proceeded to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver of Vehicle 1 to exercise proper caution and follow traffic rules, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
