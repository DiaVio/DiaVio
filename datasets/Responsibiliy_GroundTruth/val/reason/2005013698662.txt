The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the poor road conditions caused by the heavy and blowing snow. The driver attempted to pass another vehicle on the left side without realizing the caution required due to the snow-covered road. This decision error, combined with the vehicle being disengaged from four-wheel drive, led to V1 losing control and skidding counter-clockwise, ultimately resulting in the rollover accident.
