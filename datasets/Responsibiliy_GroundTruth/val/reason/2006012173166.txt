The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and not noticing that the traffic light had changed until it was too late. Additionally, the driver stated that the front tires locked up when applying the brakes, causing the vehicle to slide through the intersection and collide with V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Pick-up) and V3 (the 2003 Ford F-250). The driver's inattentiveness and failure to stop in time contributed to the crash.
