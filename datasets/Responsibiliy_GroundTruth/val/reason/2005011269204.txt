The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to the vehicle in front of her and failed to look far enough ahead. This is evident from the fact that V1 was driving about 40mph behind the line of traffic and was unable to react in time when the vehicle in front suddenly braked and swerved. V1's assumption that the other drivers would continue to proceed also contributed to the accident. Additionally, the rush hour congestion and heavy traffic were contributing factors for all three vehicles involved in the crash. However, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and anticipate the actions of other drivers makes her primarily responsible for the collision.
