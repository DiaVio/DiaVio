The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 broke traction on the snow-covered road surface and crossed the median into the path of Vehicle 1. This action caused the collision between the front right areas of both vehicles, resulting in severe damage to Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 2's loss of control and crossing into oncoming traffic is the primary cause of the accident.
