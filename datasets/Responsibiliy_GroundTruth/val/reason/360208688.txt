The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound on a two-lane, two-way highway and failed to negotiate a left curve in the road. Instead of following the curve, V1 continued straight and departed the roadway to the right, ultimately colliding with a large tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, resulting in the accident.
