The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed its travel lane and crossed through the southbound travel lane, ultimately colliding with the parked Vehicle 2 (the 2010 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedan). This indicates that Vehicle 1 was not in control and failed to maintain its lane, resulting in the collision.
