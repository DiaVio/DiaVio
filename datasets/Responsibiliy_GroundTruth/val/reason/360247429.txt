The reason for this is that V1 was traveling east on a two-lane dirt roadway and lost control while negotiating a curve. V1 rotated counterclockwise, departed the roadway, and impacted the ground, resulting in moderate damage. V1 then pivoted to the right and began to rollover, completing four quarter turns before coming to a final rest partially submerged in the water. The driver of V1, a 47-year-old female, was wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt, indicating that she was properly restrained. There were no airbag deployments. However, the driver sustained serious injuries, suggesting that the rollover was a result of the driver's loss of control rather than any external factors.
