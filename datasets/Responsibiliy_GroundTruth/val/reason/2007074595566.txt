The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions, which resulted in a loss of control and sliding off the roadway. Additionally, the driver's emotional distress, stemming from a previous crash and fear, likely contributed to the poor decision-making and inability to properly navigate the curve. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Kia Optima) applied the brakes when she saw V1 sliding into her lane, indicating a reasonable reaction to the situation. However, V2's actions alone did not cause the crash, as the primary responsibility lies with V1 for traveling too fast for the icy conditions and losing control of the vehicle.
