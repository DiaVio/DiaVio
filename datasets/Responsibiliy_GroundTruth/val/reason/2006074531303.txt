The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the opposite lane, crossing over the left lane line, which resulted in the collision with V1 (the motorcycle). V2's claim that V1 did not have a turn signal or headlights on at the time does not absolve V2 of responsibility, as it is the duty of the driver to ensure the road is clear before making any maneuvers. Additionally, V2 was a newly licensed driver who had just received his regular driver's license the day prior to the crash. This lack of experience may have contributed to his failure to properly observe the road and notice V1. Overall, V2's encroachment into the opposite lane and failure to see V1 before the collision makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
