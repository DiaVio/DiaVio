The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including yelling obscenities and making gestures with his middle finger towards the driver of the SUV. This aggressive behavior likely distracted V1 and caused him to lose control of his vehicle, resulting in the collision with the rear of V2 (the 2003 Toyota Camry) which was stopped at a red light. Additionally, V1's statement about being cut off by the SUV and losing control does not align with the vehicle damage and the witness account from the driver of the SUV. The driver of the SUV stated that V1 was the one driving aggressively and passed him on the right before colliding with V2. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to maintain control of his vehicle make him primarily responsible for the accident.
