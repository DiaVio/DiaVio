The driver of V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the 1989 Honda Accord) just as V2 entered the intersection. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the collision. Although V2 could have assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so.
