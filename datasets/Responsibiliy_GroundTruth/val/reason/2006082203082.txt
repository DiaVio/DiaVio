The reason for this is that V1 moved to the left for an unknown reason and struck the right side of V2 (the 2004 Hyundai Elantra). V1's movement into the adjacent lane caused the collision, resulting in both vehicles hitting the median jersey barrier. Although the driver of V1 denied purposely moving to the left, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. This indicates that V1 crossed into the adjacent lane, leading to the collision. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident, as V1's movement into the adjacent lane caused the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their movement into the adjacent lane, resulting in the collision with V2.
