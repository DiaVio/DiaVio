The reason for this is that V1's actions of slamming on the brakes and steering left in response to the phantom vehicle cutting into his lane were deemed a performance error and poor directional control. The driver of V1 should have been able to maintain control over his vehicle and avoid such a drastic maneuver, especially considering the road conditions (dry roads, clear skies) and the fact that he was traveling at the posted speed limit.
