The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, specifically crossing over the left lane line from the adjacent lane. This indicates that V2 was the vehicle that initiated the contact with V1 by encroaching into its lane. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 swerved to the right and struck the left side of V2, indicating that V1 was trying to avoid the encroaching vehicle. Therefore, V2's actions of crossing over into V1's lane can be considered the main cause of the crash.
