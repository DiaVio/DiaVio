The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop behind V2 (1997 Ford F-150) at the traffic light, resulting in the front of V1 striking the back of V2. Additionally, it is mentioned in the summary that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, which further indicates their negligence and impaired judgment. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and the driver's impaired state contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
