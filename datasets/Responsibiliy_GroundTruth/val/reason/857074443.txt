The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling west and intended to pass through the intersection, while Vehicle 1 was traveling east and intended to turn left at the intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, resulting in an angle impact where Vehicle 2's frontal plane struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 1. Since Vehicle 2 was passing through the intersection, they had the responsibility to yield to any vehicles turning left. Therefore, Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, leading to the collision.
