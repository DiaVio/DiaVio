The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 before turning left into its path. The driver claimed to have a protected left turn arrow, but it was determined that she actually had a green light and failed to yield the right of way to V2. This indicates that V1's driver was at fault for not adequately surveilling the intersection and failing to look far enough ahead. On the other hand, V2 had a green light and was traveling at a reasonable speed. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
