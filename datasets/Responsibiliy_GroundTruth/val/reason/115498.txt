The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control on the wet surface, drifted to the left, and crossed into the paved shoulder where Vehicle two (V2) was legally parked. V1 then struck the rear of V2 in an offset mode, indicating that V1 was not able to maintain control and avoid the collision.
