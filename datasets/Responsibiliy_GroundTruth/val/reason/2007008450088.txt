The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a vehicle approaching from behind while talking on the phone. This distraction caused him to take his attention away from the traffic in front of him. When he turned back around, it was too late for him to stop in time and he struck V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
