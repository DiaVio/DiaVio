The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Dodge Neon, was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The Critical Precrash Event for V2 was coded as a recognition error of inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver did not look far enough ahead to notice V1 approaching in the southbound lane. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V1. On the other hand, V1, the driver of the Honda Accord, stated that she saw the traffic light change to yellow and decided to continue through the intersection. While she was distracted by eating at the time of the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for not properly observing the oncoming traffic and making a safe left turn. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the recognition error of inadequate surveillance.
