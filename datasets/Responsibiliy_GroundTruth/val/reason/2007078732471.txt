The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, which was identified as the critical pre-crash event. The driver admitted to possibly dozing off prior to losing control of the vehicle. This driver-related factor of sleeping while driving directly contributed to the vehicle departing the roadway and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, other contributing factors include the high winds in excess of 80 kmph (50 mph) and the presence of blowing dust and debris in the area. These environmental conditions, combined with the driver's unfamiliarity with the rental vehicle, further compromised the driver's ability to maintain control. Furthermore, the driver's consumption of marijuana, as indicated by the positive test result, may have impaired their judgment and reaction time, making them more susceptible to losing control of the vehicle. The weight of the occupants and cargo inside the vehicle, although a contributing factor, does not absolve the driver of responsibility. It is the driver's duty to ensure that the vehicle is operated safely, regardless of the weight it carries. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rollover accident due to the driver falling asleep at the wheel, combined with the environmental conditions, drug consumption, and unfamiliarity with the vehicle.
