The reason for V1's responsibility is that she swerved left to avoid an unknown vehicle encroaching into her travel lane, but in doing so, she lost control of her vehicle and struck a curb and a light post. This indicates a performance error and overcompensation on the part of V1. Additionally, the driver's lack of familiarity with the roadway and inattention due to conversing with the passenger are contributing factors to her responsibility.
