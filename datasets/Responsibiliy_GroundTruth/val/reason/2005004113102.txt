The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down at his clipboard, resulting in a driver recognition error and inadequate surveillance. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that V2 was stopped in the westbound lane, leading to the collision between V1 and V2. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper attention and awareness of the road conditions makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
