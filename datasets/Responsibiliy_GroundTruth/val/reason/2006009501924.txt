The reason for this is that V1 departed its lane to the left, crossed over the oncoming traffic lane, and ultimately departed the roadway to the left. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's recognition error and internal distraction, as well as the fact that she was engaged in conversation with her passengers and other non-driving activities, contributed to the crash. Furthermore, the driver was also traveling too fast for the conditions, which further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
