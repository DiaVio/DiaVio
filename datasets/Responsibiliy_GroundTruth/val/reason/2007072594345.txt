The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side," indicating that V1 veered off the road and struck the concrete barrier. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control (e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." This suggests that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to navigate the roadway properly. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as well as the presence of heavy rain and a wet roadway. These factors further contribute to the driver's inability to control the vehicle and ultimately led to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
