The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, but contacted the left front corner of Vehicle two (V2), which was traveling straight through the intersection. V1 was in the left turn lane, although the driver claimed her intention was to continue straight through the intersection. However, when traffic prevented her from doing so, she decided to make the left turn. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was coded as turning left at the intersection, indicating that the driver's left turn maneuver was a contributing factor to the crash. The Critical Reason for the Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as an unknown recognition error, suggesting that the driver may have failed to properly recognize the traffic situation or misjudged the timing of the turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's improper left turn maneuver and potential recognition error.
