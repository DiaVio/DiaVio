The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize the stopped vehicle in her lane and made a recognition error due to inattention. This is evident from the fact that she noticed the other vehicle already stopped for the light at the intersection but was unable to avoid the collision. Additionally, the associated factors of taking medications for arthritis, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, and hypertension, as well as the reported physical difficulties, may have contributed to her inattention and inability to react in time. V2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Impala) was stopped for the yellow light and had been stationary for a few seconds before the crash occurred. Although V2 had three different size tires, including one with no tread, this does not appear to be a contributing factor to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's recognition error and inattention, while V2 was stopped and not at fault.
