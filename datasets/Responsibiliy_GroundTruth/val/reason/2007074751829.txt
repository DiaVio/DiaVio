The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the turn. The driver of V1 admitted to looking left at her turn destination and not seeing V2 prior to the crash. This indicates a failure to properly check for oncoming vehicles, which is a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the inexperience of the driver of V1, who had only eight months of driving experience at the time of the crash, is considered an associated factor in this accident.
