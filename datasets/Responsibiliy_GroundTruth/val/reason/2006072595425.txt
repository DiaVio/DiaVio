The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is as follows: - V1 encroached into lane one and sideswiped V2's left side, indicating a failure to maintain their lane and causing the initial collision. - V1 then continued on and collided with V3, causing significant damage and pushing V3 into V5. - Finally, V1 collided with the left front corner of V4. Therefore, V1's actions of encroaching into another lane, causing multiple collisions, and failing to maintain their lane make them primarily responsible for the crash.
