The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the vehicle departed the roadway to the right and followed a ditch until it ended. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the subsequent collision with the dirt embankment and the vehicle rolling into the ravine. The exact driver error is unknown, but the evidence suggests that the driver made a mistake that caused the vehicle to leave the road and ultimately crash.
