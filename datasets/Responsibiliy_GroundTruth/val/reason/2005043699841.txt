The reason for V1's responsibility is the physical impairment of the driver's ability to act. The driver stated that she has a weak stomach and experiences frequent bouts of nausea and light-headedness. She had a stomach ache on the morning of the crash and mentioned feeling dizzy just prior to the crash. The driver then fainted, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately causing it to travel off the road, across a parking lot, and collide with a building.
