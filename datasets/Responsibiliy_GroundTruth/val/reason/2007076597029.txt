The driver of V1 stated that he was driving at a speed between 105-113 kmph (65-70 mph), which is above the posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). Additionally, he admitted that he did not see the elk until he was about to impact it and did not attempt any avoidance maneuver. This indicates a lack of adequate surveillance and failure to react in a timely manner to the presence of the animal. Furthermore, the driver stated that he was not aware that animals crossed this roadway, despite the presence of warning signs for this hazard. This lack of awareness suggests a failure to exercise due caution and adapt his driving behavior to the conditions of the road. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to speeding, inadequate surveillance, and a lack of awareness of the potential hazard of animals crossing the roadway.
