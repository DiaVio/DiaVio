The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted right and departed the north edge of the roadway, striking the curb and subsequently hitting trees and a tree with its frontal plane. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the collision with the tree. Additionally, the fact that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unbelted suggests a lack of adherence to safety measures, which may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
