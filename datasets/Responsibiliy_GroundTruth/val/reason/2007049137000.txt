The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2 (the driver of the 2005 Honda Pilot) into the southbound lanes without seeing V2 prior to impact. V1 stated that there was a bus stopped in the first northbound lane that obstructed her view of the northbound lanes. However, V1 had been stopped at the stop sign for more than ten seconds and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn, despite having an obstructed view, is the primary reason for the accident. Additionally, V1's inexperience as a new driver (less than 6 months) is considered an associated factor in this crash.
