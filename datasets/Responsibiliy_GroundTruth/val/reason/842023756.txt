The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to partially depart the right pavement edge and then redirected it back across the roadway, ultimately resulting in the vehicle entering a private yard and colliding with a large diameter tree. This indicates a failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, leading to the accident.
