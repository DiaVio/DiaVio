The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not look far enough ahead, resulting in inadequate surveillance. This is supported by the fact that V1's critical pre-crash event was "other motor vehicle stopped in the traffic lane ahead" and the critical reason for the event was coded as "inadequate surveillance failed to look, looked but did not see." Additionally, V1's brakes were found to be deficient, as reported by the driver and supported by the researcher's inspection. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance, coupled with the brake deficiency, led to the collision with V2 and subsequently V3.
