The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to adequately survey the intersection before making her left turn. This is evident from the fact that she did not see V2 (the 2004 Chrysler Sebring convertible) approaching in the southbound lane. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look or see V2 resulted in the collision. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within the speed limit and did not contribute to the crash. The driver of V2 reported that V1 turned right in front of her and she couldn't stop in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her inadequate surveillance and failure to see V2 approaching before making her left turn.
