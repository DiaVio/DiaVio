The reason for V1's responsibility is that the right rear wheel of the vehicle separated, causing the driver to lose control. This disabling vehicle failure was the critical pre-crash event, and the critical reason for this event was a vehicle-related error, specifically the failure of the wheels/tires. The driver's inexperience, having only been driving for 12 months, may have also contributed to the inability to properly handle the situation and avoid the crash.
