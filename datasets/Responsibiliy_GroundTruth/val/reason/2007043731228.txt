The driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2, assuming that V2 was entering the highway ramp and would have to yield to him. This false assumption led to V1 turning left in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to making a decision error to turn left. Therefore, V1's actions and false assumption were the main contributing factors to the accident.
