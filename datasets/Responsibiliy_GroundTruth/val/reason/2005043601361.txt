The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver did not confirm that the intersection was clear to make the turn, which resulted in V1 entering the intersection and being struck by V2 (the driver of the 1992 Ford Bronco). Additionally, there were several associated factors that contributed to V1's responsibility, including inattention and being upset due to her father's illness and impending surgery, the traffic flow interruption caused by the bridge construction, the driver's hurry to reach her destination, and her lack of familiarity with the roadway. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the intersection and make a safe left turn makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
