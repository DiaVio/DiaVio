The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize and obey the stop sign at the intersection. The driver's inadequate surveillance and distraction from the driving task, due to concerns about the passengers in the back seat and thinking about a future event, contributed to the driver's failure to see the stop sign until it was too late. Additionally, the driver's vision impairment, as he was not wearing his corrective lenses, further hindered his ability to properly observe the intersection. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising the necessary caution and attention required while driving, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
