The driver of V1 ran a red light, as confirmed by the police officer who witnessed the crash. The driver of V1 stated that she believed the light was green, but the investigation found that there was room for confusion at the intersection due to the placement of two sets of traffic lights. The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and only saw the green light on the second set of traffic signals, leading to the collision with V2 (the 2002 Subaru Outback) and subsequently with V3 (the 2004 Ford Econoline E250 van). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors, including inadequate surveillance and failing to stop for a traffic control device.
