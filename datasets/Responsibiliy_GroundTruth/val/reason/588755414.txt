The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by a 70-year-old male, was traveling straight in the eastbound through lane and collided with the front right area of Vehicle 2, which was in the left turn lane intending to turn left. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, causing the collision.
