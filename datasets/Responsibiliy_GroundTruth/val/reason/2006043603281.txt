The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. The driver of V1 did not look to see if the intersection was clear before initiating the turn. This lack of surveillance, combined with the false assumption that the roadway was clear after another vehicle waived him on, led to V1 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so. Although V2 (the driver of the 1995 Ford Taurus) mentioned that another southbound vehicle may have obstructed V1's sightline, it is stated that there was very little traffic on the road at the time. Therefore, V1 should have been able to see V2 approaching and should have yielded the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and a false assumption, which resulted in the collision with V2.
