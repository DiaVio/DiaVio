The reason for this is that V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior by attempting to pass V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight) despite seeing the right turn signal blinking on V2. V1 made the decision to pass V2, misjudging the distance and speed, resulting in the front of V1 striking the right side of V2. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of approximately 72 kmph (45 mph) in a school zone where the posted speed limit was 32 kmph (20 mph). This indicates a disregard for the safety of others on the road. Therefore, V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to adhere to the speed limit make them primarily responsible for the accident.
