The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as noted by the investigating officer, and was issued citations for driving under the influence and having a BAC of 0.18 or more. This impaired the driver's ability to maintain proper control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 exiting the road multiple times and ultimately crashing into a dirt embankment and rolling over. Additionally, the wet road conditions may have further contributed to the driver's poor directional control.
