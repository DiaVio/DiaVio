The driver of V1 failed to recognize that traffic was slowing down ahead and was inattentive or daydreaming at the time of the crash. This is evident from the fact that V1 struck the rear of V2, causing a chain reaction that resulted in the collision with V3. The driver of V1 had the opportunity to brake prior to impact but was unable to avoid hitting V2.
