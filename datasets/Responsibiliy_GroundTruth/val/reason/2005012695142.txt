The driver of V1 stated that she thought she might be traveling too fast for the icy conditions and attempted to slow down by tapping the brakes. This action caused her vehicle to skid and lose control, ultimately resulting in the collision with the light post and tree. The driver's acknowledgment of traveling too fast for the conditions indicates a lack of caution and failure to adjust her driving behavior accordingly. Additionally, the slick condition of the roadway and the sleet weather were contributing factors, but the driver's decision to tap the brakes instead of slowing down gradually or using other appropriate measures demonstrates a lack of proper judgment. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adapt to the road conditions and control the vehicle appropriately.
