The reason for this is that V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, striking the tunnel wall with both the front and back right side of the vehicle. V1 then continued across both lanes and struck the jersey barrier on the left side of the roadway. Since the driver of V1 appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and was not interviewed at the scene, it suggests that impaired driving may have been a contributing factor to the accident. However, without further information, the exact driver error or cause of the accident cannot be determined.
