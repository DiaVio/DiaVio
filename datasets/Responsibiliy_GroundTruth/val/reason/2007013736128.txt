The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and claimed that the brakes failed, but there is no evidence or mention of brake failure in the police report. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to be fatigued and using prescription medications for diabetes and arthritis, which could have impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. V2 (the driver of the 1994 Lincoln Town Car) was stopped at a red light when it was struck from behind by V1. While V2 was involved in the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to maintain a safe distance and colliding with the vehicle in front. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance.
