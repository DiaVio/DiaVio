The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 changed lanes to the right and turned right in front of V2 in an attempt to enter the highway on-ramp. - V1 turned from the wrong lane, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1's aggressive driving behavior, including cutting in front of V2 from the wrong lane and applying brakes to potentially cause a rear-end collision, contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1's actions of changing lanes improperly and attempting to enter the on-ramp from the wrong lane make them primarily responsible for the collision.
