The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver admitted that he may have entered the curve too fast and was not thinking about the road conditions due to being preoccupied with a physics test. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and lack of attention further contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
