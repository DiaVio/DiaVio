The reason for this is that the driver claimed to have lost control of the vehicle due to mechanical problems, specifically mentioning a possible steering failure. As the driver of the vehicle, it is their responsibility to ensure that their vehicle is in proper working condition before operating it on the road. If there were any known issues with the steering or any other mechanical component, it is the driver's responsibility to address and resolve those issues before driving. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the vehicle was slightly fishtailing, indicating that they may have been driving at an unsafe speed or not maintaining proper control of the vehicle. It is the driver's responsibility to adjust their driving behavior to the road conditions and maintain control of the vehicle at all times. Therefore, based on the driver's claim of mechanical problems and their failure to maintain control of the vehicle, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
