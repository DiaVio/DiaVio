The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is as follows: - The V1 driver was under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol level of 0.281, which is significantly above the legal limit. - The driver also tested positive for THC, indicating the presence of marijuana in their system. - The critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating a lack of control by the driver. - The critical reason for the crash was coded as driver-related overcompensation, suggesting that the driver's actions contributed to the loss of control. - Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the curve and had poor directional control. These factors indicate that the actions and impairment of the V1 driver were the primary causes of the crash.
