The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 stated to the investigating officer that she did not see Vehicle 2 until she hit it. A witness also confirmed that Vehicle 1 did not slow down until it struck Vehicle 2. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain a proper lookout and failed to react in a timely manner to the presence of Vehicle 2 stopped in the roadway. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
