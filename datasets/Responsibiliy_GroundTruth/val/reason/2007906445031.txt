The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling too fast for the road conditions. Despite being aware of the poor road conditions and having taken driver's education, V1 failed to adjust their speed accordingly. This resulted in them losing control of their vehicle and skidding into the intersection, ultimately colliding with V2 (the Freightliner truck). Additionally, V1 was distracted by a conversation with their passenger, which further contributed to their inability to stop at the stop sign. The slick road conditions and the view obstruction caused by the overpass wall also played a role in the accident, but V1's failure to adjust their speed and their distraction were the primary factors leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the conditions and being distracted while driving.
