The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed as they exited the private drive and attempted to turn right onto the westbound lanes. This decision to turn at a high speed was a decision error, as the driver was going too fast for the curve/turn. This resulted in the vehicle rolling over and ultimately coming to rest on its side. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed to be fatigued, which may have contributed to their decision to drive at a high rate of speed. However, regardless of fatigue, it is the responsibility of the driver to operate their vehicle safely and within the speed limit. In this case, the driver's decision to turn at a high speed was a contributing factor to the crash.
