The driver of V1 was charged with failure to yield, indicating that she did not give the right of way to V2 (the 2005 Lexus ES330) when making a left turn. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V1 was inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 did not properly observe or assess the oncoming traffic before attempting to make the left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not see the other vehicle approaching, further indicating a lack of attention or awareness. On the other hand, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V2 was not coded, as the driver could not be located for a follow-up interview. Therefore, there is no clear evidence to suggest that V2 was at fault or contributed to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance.
