The reason for V1's responsibility is that it lost control on the icy road and began to fishtail. Despite the poor road conditions, V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, which ultimately led to it sliding across the center lane and colliding with Vehicle Two (V2). V1's departure from its lane and subsequent crossing into the eastbound travel lanes directly caused the collision.
