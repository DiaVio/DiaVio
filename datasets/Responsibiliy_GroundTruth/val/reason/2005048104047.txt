The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was not paying attention (inattention/daydreaming) while negotiating the curve, which caused the vehicle to depart the right side of the roadway and ultimately collide with a tree. The driver's depression and medication may have contributed to her inattentiveness and lack of focus on the road. Additionally, the fact that the driver was familiar with the road and had been driving the vehicle daily for the last month suggests that she should have been aware of the curve and taken appropriate precautions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
