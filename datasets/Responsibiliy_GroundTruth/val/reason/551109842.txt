The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway to the left and collided with a utility timber pole. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1 was in a slight clockwise rotation suggests that the driver may have been driving at an excessive speed for the curve, as the posted speed limit was 25 mph/40 kmph.
