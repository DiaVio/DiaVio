The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 59 kmph (37 MPH) and failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 (1985 Jeep Cherokee) which was stopped in the traffic lane. Despite seeing V2 ahead, the driver of V1 attempted to switch lanes but was unable to do so due to heavy traffic in the #1 lane. The driver then applied the brakes but still collided with the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of other vehicles on the road.
