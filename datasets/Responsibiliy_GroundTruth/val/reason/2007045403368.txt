The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before initiating the turn. The driver stated that his view was obstructed by the overpass supports and wall to his left, but it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed before making a turn. Additionally, the witness statement contradicts the driver's claim that he had stopped at the red light before starting the turn, further suggesting that the driver did not exercise proper caution. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and make a safe left turn.
