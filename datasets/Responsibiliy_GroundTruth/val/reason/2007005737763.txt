The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to taking his eyes off the road for a moment, resulting in V1 drifting over the lane line and colliding with the parked vehicle (V2, the 2006 Kia Sedona minivan). This indicates driver distraction as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver's medical conditions, including diabetes, epilepsy, high blood pressure, and chronic back pain, along with the use of medications to treat these conditions, may have contributed to the driver's distraction and impaired driving ability. Although the owner of V2 was not present at the time of the crash, there is no evidence to suggest that the owner of V2 bears any responsibility for the accident.
