The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by his cell phone. He admitted to looking away from the road to retrieve his phone and was unable to react in time to avoid the collision. This distraction caused him to fail to recognize the slower traffic ahead and resulted in the collision with the back of V2 (the Toyota Sequoia).
