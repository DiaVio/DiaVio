The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. V1 swerved left and crossed over multiple lanes before impacting the left side concrete barrier. This indicates a failure to properly check blind spots and exercise caution while changing lanes, resulting in the collision.
