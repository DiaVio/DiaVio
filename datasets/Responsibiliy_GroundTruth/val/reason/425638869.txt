The reason for this is that V1 was traveling south on a curved road and failed to negotiate the right curve, crossing over the center line and departing the left side of the road. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, leading to the subsequent events of impacting the culvert, the ground, and the embankment.
