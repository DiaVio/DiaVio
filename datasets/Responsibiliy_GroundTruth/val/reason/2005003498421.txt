The driver of Vehicle # 2 attempted to make a left turn into a gas station, misjudging the gap and the speed of oncoming Vehicle # 1. This decision error, along with factors such as driver inattention due to a pending future event (hurrying to the hospital) and conversing with the passenger, contributed to the accident. Therefore, Vehicle # 2 is primarily responsible for the crash.
