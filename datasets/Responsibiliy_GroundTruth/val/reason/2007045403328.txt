The reason for this is that V1 was traveling downhill on the two-lane roadway and was out of control. It failed to stop at the stop sign and crossed the five-lane roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic. This resulted in V1 striking and jumping the median, and ultimately departing the roadway and crashing down an embankment. The driver of V1 reported that the steering did not respond to his input and he was unable to turn left or right. He was uncertain if he had attempted to brake or if he had accidentally hit the gas instead. The driver's degraded skills, due to his age and medical conditions, were identified as a critical reason for the poor directional control of the vehicle. Additionally, the vehicle inspection revealed no mechanical malfunction that could have contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, based on the driver's lack of control and failure to yield, as well as the absence of mechanical issues, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
