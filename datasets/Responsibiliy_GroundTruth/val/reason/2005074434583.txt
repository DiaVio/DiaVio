The driver of V1 admitted to losing control of the vehicle after it went off the road into the snow. This indicates a lack of skill in controlling the vehicle, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned not liking driving this particular vehicle due to its size, suggesting a possible lack of familiarity and experience with handling such a vehicle. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1997 Dodge Ram) noticed V1 departing the roadway and attempted to avoid the collision by steering right. This indicates that the driver of V2 took appropriate evasive action in response to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's poor directional control and lack of skill in handling the vehicle.
