The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one was unable to stop in time and rear-ended vehicle two, indicating inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of vehicle one stated that she was driving at a very low speed (less than 16 kph or 10 mph) and was only one car length behind vehicle two when it stopped. This suggests that the driver of vehicle one was not maintaining a safe following distance and was not paying enough attention to the road and traffic conditions. On the other hand, there is no known pre-crash information about the driver of vehicle two, so it is not possible to determine if they were also at fault or if there were any contributing factors from their side. Overall, based on the given information, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of vehicle one due to inadequate surveillance and failure to maintain a safe following distance.
