The driver of V1 made a U-turn across the roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the 2003 Mazda B-series pickup). This action resulted in V2 colliding with the left side of V1. V1's misjudgment of the gap in V2's speed and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he thought he had enough time to make the U-turn, indicating a lack of awareness and understanding of the traffic situation.
