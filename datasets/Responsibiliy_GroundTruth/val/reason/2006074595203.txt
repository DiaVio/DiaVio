The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was following too closely behind the large truck and failed to maintain a safe distance. When the truck ran a red light, V2 had to brake hard to stop, and V1 (the 1986 Chrysler New Yorker) was unable to react in time and collided with the rear of V2. Additionally, the driver of V2 had only been driving since February of that year and stated that she was fatigued due to a long day at work. This may have contributed to her inability to react quickly and avoid the collision.
