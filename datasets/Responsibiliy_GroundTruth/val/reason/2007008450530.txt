The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 initiated an illegal U-turn, which resulted in the collision with V2 (the Ford Windstar). V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and ensure it was safe to make the U-turn. This driver error of inadequate surveillance led to the collision.
