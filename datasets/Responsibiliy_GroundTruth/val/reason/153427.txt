The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, veered left into the median, crossed the median, and entered the left southbound lane. This action caused V1, the 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, to collide with the right side of V2. As a result, V3, the 2007 Nissan Altima, was unable to avoid V1 and collided with the rear of V1. Therefore, the initial loss of control by the driver of V2 is the main cause of the accident, making V2 primarily responsible.
