The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle making the left turn at the intersection, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection." Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; misjudgment of gap or other's speed." This indicates that the driver of V2 misjudged the gap between V1 and herself, leading to the collision. Furthermore, the driver of V2 had only twelve months of driving experience and was unfamiliar with the road, which suggests a lack of experience and knowledge that may have contributed to the misjudgment.
