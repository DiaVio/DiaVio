The reason for this is that V1, driven by the 21-year-old female driver, drifted across the center line and off the left side of the roadway. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the collision with the ditch and utility pole. The driver's failure to stay within the designated lane and control the vehicle's movement led to the accident.
