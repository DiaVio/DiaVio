The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at the clock on the instrument panel, which caused him to assume that the forward traffic would continue moving forward. This distraction led to V1 not noticing the stopped vehicles ahead and subsequently colliding with the rear of V2. Therefore, V1's internal distraction and failure to pay attention to the road and the stopped vehicles ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
