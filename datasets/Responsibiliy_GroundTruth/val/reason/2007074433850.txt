The reason for this is that according to witnesses and the driver of V2 (2002 Jeep Liberty), V1 moved to the right and struck the back of V2. This indicates that V1 made an unsafe lane change, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating," suggesting that V1 was not paying attention and failed to notice the decelerating V2 in front of them. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; this vehicle decelerating," indicating that V2 was following the flow of traffic and slowing down due to congestion. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 was "not coded to this vehicle," suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their unsafe lane change and inattention while driving.
