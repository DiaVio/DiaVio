The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to slow down, despite V2 decelerating for a red traffic light. V2's driver attempted to change lanes to avoid a crash, but V1 still struck the right rear of V2. The fact that V1 was traveling at a high speed and did not slow down indicates a lack of attention or disregard for the traffic conditions, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
