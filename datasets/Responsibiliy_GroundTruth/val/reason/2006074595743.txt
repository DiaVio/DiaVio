The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was the illegal maneuver of driving through a traffic signal. The driver of Vehicle 2 stated that she stopped at the intersection, but then proceeded to cross the intersection without ensuring it was safe to do so. This is supported by the video evidence showing Vehicle 2 entering the intersection and being struck by Vehicle 1. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 2 was not familiar with the route traveled or the vehicle, which may have contributed to her misjudgment of the situation. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's illegal maneuver of driving through a traffic signal.
