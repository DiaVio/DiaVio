The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately survey the traffic before making the turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as an "other" decision error - turning with an obstructed view. Additionally, V1 had a sightline restriction caused by the non-contact truck in the right lane, which may have contributed to the failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic. While V2 (the driver of the Chrysler Pacifica) was traveling in the second westbound lane, it is important to note that V1 had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic when making a left turn. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly survey the traffic and make a safe left turn at the intersection.
