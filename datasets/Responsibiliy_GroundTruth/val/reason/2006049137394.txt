The driver of Vehicle one stated that he did not recognize that Vehicle two was stopped with enough time to avoid the accident. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was attributed to driver-related factor: inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle one failed to properly observe the road ahead and failed to notice that Vehicle two was stopped. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane: traveling in the same direction with a higher speed." This indicates that Vehicle two was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's lack of recognition and inadequate surveillance, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident.
