The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle # 2 indicates that it was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, which is an illegal maneuver. The driver of Vehicle # 2 was attempting to make a right turn from the left lane, which is not allowed. This illegal maneuver resulted in the collision with Vehicle # 1 (Ford Windstar) that was making a right turn from the right turn lane. Therefore, Vehicle # 2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
