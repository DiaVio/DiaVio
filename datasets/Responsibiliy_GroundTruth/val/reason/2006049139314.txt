The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn of the exit ramp, causing it to depart the roadway on the left side and subsequently lose control. This resulted in V1 crossing multiple travel lanes and being struck by V2 (the 1997 Ford F-150 pick-up truck). V2's involvement in the accident was not a critical pre-crash event and therefore does not contribute to the primary responsibility.
