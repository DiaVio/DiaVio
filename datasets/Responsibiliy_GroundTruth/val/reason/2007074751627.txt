The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle that encroached into the path of V1, resulting in the collision. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the front of V2 to strike the right side of V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by talking to her passengers and not paying adequate attention to the roadway. These factors contribute to V2's responsibility for the accident.
