The driver of V1 admitted to following a non-contact vehicle too closely and being distracted by talking to his wife while driving. He entered the intersection on a green light and turned left across the path of V2, causing the collision. The driver of V2 had the right of way and was unable to avoid the collision with V1. Therefore, V1's actions of following too closely, being distracted, and failing to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
