The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that it made a decision error and misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier) while attempting to change lanes. Vehicle #1 was following closely behind Vehicle #2 and attempted to get the driver of Vehicle #2 to move over and let it pass. In an effort to increase the following distance, the driver of Vehicle #2 tapped the brakes. However, instead of maintaining a safe distance, Vehicle #1 changed lanes to the right and began to pass Vehicle #2. When Vehicle #1 tried to return to the far left lane in front of Vehicle #2, there was a slower-moving non-contact vehicle in the center lane ahead. It appears that Vehicle #2 sped up as Vehicle #1 was attempting to change lanes to the left, resulting in the collision between the two vehicles. Therefore, Vehicle #1's decision to change lanes without ensuring a safe gap and misjudging the speed of Vehicle #2 led to the accident.
