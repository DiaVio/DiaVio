The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that it struck the right side of the 2004 Saturn Ion, causing it to lose control and enter a counter clockwise rotation. The impact was severe, with a calculated delta-v of 52 kmph (32 mph), which is consistent with the observed vehicle damage. This indicates that V2's actions were significant enough to cause the accident. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the case occupant, including a posterior fracture of the right #11 rib with pneumothorax, a liver laceration, diffuse axonal injury, bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages in the cerebrum, brain edema, and loss of consciousness with neurological deficit, were a result of contact with the beltline of the right-front interior door. This suggests that the impact from V2's collision played a significant role in causing these injuries. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
