The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before turning left. The driver stated that they looked both left and right to monitor for cross traffic but did not see V2 (the motorcycle) before pulling into the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming motorcycle, resulting in the collision.
