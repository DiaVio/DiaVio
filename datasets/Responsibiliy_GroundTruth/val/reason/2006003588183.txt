The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive action by swerving to the right to avoid the bicyclist on his left side. This evasive action was inappropriate and unsuccessful, resulting in the collision with the parked vehicle (V2). Additionally, factors such as fatigue, lack of sufficient sleep, work-related stress, and external distraction (the bicyclist) contributed to the driver's incorrect evasive action.
