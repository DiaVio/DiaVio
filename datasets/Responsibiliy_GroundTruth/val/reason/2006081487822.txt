The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was reported to be asleep prior to the impact. The investigating officer's report states that the driver was actually asleep while driving, which is a driver-related factor. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not alert and in control of the vehicle, leading to the vehicle drifting off the roadway and colliding with the parked Vehicle 2 (V2).
