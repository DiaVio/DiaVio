The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the left northbound through-lane of the intersecting 4-lane roadway, which was controlled by a yellow-flashing overhead light. V1, on the other hand, was traveling in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and had the right of way at the intersection, as indicated by the stop sign and overhead flashing red light. Since V2 failed to yield to V1 and struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration, it can be concluded that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
