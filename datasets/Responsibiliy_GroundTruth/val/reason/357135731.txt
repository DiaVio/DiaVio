The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver drifted off the roadway, over-corrected, and lost control of the vehicle. This resulted in the vehicle entering a counterclockwise yaw, crossing through the northbound lane, and ultimately rolling over multiple times before coming to rest on its roof. The driver's actions of drifting off the road and over-correcting indicate a lack of proper control and attention, leading to the accident.
