The driver of V1 changed lanes to the left in order to pass a city transit bus that was stopped in his travel lane. However, the driver of V1 failed to slow down in time as he approached the congested traffic in front of him. As a result, the front of V1 made contact with the back of V2 (the Volvo S60), which then caused the front of V2 to make contact with the back of V3 (the Porsche Boxster). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident because the driver failed to maintain a safe following distance and did not slow down in time to avoid a collision with the vehicle in front of him.
