The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was turning left at the intersection, which is a potentially risky maneuver. V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the Acura 3.2), which was traveling in a straight line in its designated lane. This failure to yield resulted in the front of V2 making contact with the right side of V1's vehicle. Additionally, V1's driver mentioned that people always get hit in that intersection, implying a lack of caution or awareness of the potential dangers associated with turning at that location. V1's driver also mentioned that people try to beat the light, suggesting a possible disregard for traffic signals. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection.
