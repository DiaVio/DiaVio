The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver mentioned in the interview that she could not see around a large trash truck opposite her, but she still proceeded to turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and caution on the part of V1. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Stratus) was traveling in the correct lane and had the right of way with a green signal. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance while making a left turn.
