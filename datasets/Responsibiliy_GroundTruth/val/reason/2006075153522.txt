The driver of V1 swerved the vehicle in an attempt to avoid hitting the deer, which caused the vehicle to lose control and ultimately roll over. Additionally, the driver's high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.213 indicates that they were impaired at the time of the accident. The combination of poor directional control and impaired driving contributed to the driver's inability to safely navigate the situation, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
