The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the intersection from the west (from the northbound roadway) and collided with the front of Vehicle 1, the 2007 BMW 328i. The damage to the vehicles suggests that Vehicle 2 rode up on Vehicle 1's hood and struck its left side A-pillar and trunk area. Vehicle 1, on the other hand, departed the roadway and rolled over as a result of the impact from Vehicle 2. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the damage sustained, it can be concluded that Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
