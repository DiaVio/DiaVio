The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver suffered a medical emergency, rendering him unconscious while negotiating the uphill left curve. As a result, the vehicle veered off the road, struck the guardrail, and ultimately launched off the overpass, leading to the serious accident. The driver's loss of consciousness and inability to control the vehicle due to the medical emergency make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
