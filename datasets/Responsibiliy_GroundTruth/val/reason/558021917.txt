The reason for this is that the case vehicle was traveling on a snow-covered roadway and began to fishtail, indicating a loss of control. The driver was unable to regain control, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle suggests that they were not driving in a manner appropriate for the road conditions, which makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
