The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way and was struck by V2 (the 2004 BMW 530i) on the right side. V1's driver was found to be at fault due to inattention (daydreaming) and not realizing that he entered the intersection on a red light. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic signal and failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
