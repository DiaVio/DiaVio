The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 96 kmh (60mph) on a road with a speed limit of 89 kmh (55mph), indicating that they were exceeding the speed limit and traveling too fast for the conditions. The witness reported that V1 began to spin and observed the driver braking, suggesting that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to their excessive speed. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine, which impaired their judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. The driver's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of drugs in their system indicate that they were not in a fit state to drive. Additionally, the driver was driving with a suspended and expired license, which is a violation of traffic laws and shows a disregard for the rules of the road. Overall, the combination of excessive speed, impairment, and driving with a suspended license makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
