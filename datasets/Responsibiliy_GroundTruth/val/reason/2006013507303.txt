The driver of V2 stated that he saw the traffic light change from green to yellow and assumed that V1 would continue through the intersection. However, when V1 suddenly stopped, V2 was unable to avoid the collision. The critical event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of the other driver. Additionally, V2 was traveling too fast for the conditions and was following too closely (keeping up with traffic). These factors indicate that V2 did not maintain a safe distance from V1 and failed to react appropriately to the changing traffic situation. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to following too closely and failing to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
