The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to take extra precaution when turning into the army base due to the strong glare from the sun. The driver stated that he did not see V2 prior to impact, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver did not stop prior to initiating the left turn, which further contributed to the collision. While V2's driver had a medical condition (glaucoma) and was using prescription eye drops, the lack of interview and information about other factors prevent assigning primary responsibility to V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to take extra precaution in the presence of sun glare and lack of proper observation before making the left turn.
