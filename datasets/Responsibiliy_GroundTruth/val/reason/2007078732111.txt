The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the accident was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). Additionally, V1 was distracted by looking at the vehicle in front of her, which further contributed to the accident. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as other vehicle encroachment, specifically from the opposite direction over the left lane line. However, the critical reason for the accident was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
