The driver of V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions, assuming that V2 would stop at the red phase of the traffic signal. This false assumption led to V1 entering the intersection without taking appropriate precautions, resulting in the collision. Reason: V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's false assumption of V2's actions, which led to the failure to yield the right of way and the subsequent collision.
