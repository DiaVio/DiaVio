The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was arrested at the scene for driving under the influence and was impaired. The police report also indicated that V1 had been drinking. This impairment likely contributed to V1 traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, which was the critical pre-crash event. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and failure to stay within the lane led to the collision.
