The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver reportedly fell asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to veer off the left side of the roadway and enter the grass median. This indicates a lack of attention and control on the part of the driver, leading to the subsequent chain of events that resulted in the crash.
