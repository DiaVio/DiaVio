The reason for this is that the non-contact vehicle changed lanes to the left, into the continuing southbound lane, without yielding or giving sufficient warning to the case vehicle. This sudden lane change forced the case vehicle to take evasive action by steering sharply to the left, resulting in the collision with the center concrete divider. Therefore, the actions of the non-contact vehicle directly led to the accident.
