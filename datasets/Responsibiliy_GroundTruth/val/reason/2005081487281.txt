The driver of V1 made an other recognition error by mistakenly thinking that the right turn arrow turning green was her signal to proceed straight through the intersection. This indicates a failure to properly recognize and interpret the traffic signals, leading to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to check for cross traffic before entering the intersection. These factors contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
