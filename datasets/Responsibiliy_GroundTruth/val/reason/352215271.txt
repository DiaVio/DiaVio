The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was in the rightmost left turn lane and intended to turn left at the intersection. However, it was struck by Vehicle 2 (the 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe) in the front right corner area. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight through the intersection. Additionally, after being struck by Vehicle 2, Vehicle 1 spun counterclockwise and was then struck by Vehicle 3 (the 2008 Honda Ridgeline) on its left side. This suggests that Vehicle 1 was not able to safely complete its left turn before the collision occurred. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the failure to yield the right of way, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
