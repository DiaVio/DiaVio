The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 failed to notice the stop sign at the intersection, indicating a lack of attention and awareness of the surroundings. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway, which could have contributed to her failure to stop at the stop sign. These factors indicate that V1 did not exercise proper surveillance and caution while approaching and crossing the intersection, leading to the collision with V2.
