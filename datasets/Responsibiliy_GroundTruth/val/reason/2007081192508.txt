The reason for this is that V2 encroached into the opposite lane, crossing over the left lane line. This action by V2 caused the collision with V1, which was in the process of making a left turn. V1's visibility of V2 was obstructed by a large truck, which further contributed to the accident. However, V2's encroachment into the opposite lane was the critical pre-crash event that led to the collision.
