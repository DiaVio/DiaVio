The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, who is not licensed to drive, took inappropriate evasive maneuvers in response to the non-contact vehicle that was potentially pulling out into their lane. This driver's inexperience and incorrect evasive action led to the loss of directional control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
