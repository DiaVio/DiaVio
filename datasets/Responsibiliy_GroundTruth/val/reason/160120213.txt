The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the occupant was the driver of the vehicle involved in the collision. The description of the accident suggests that the vehicle rolled over, and the occupant sustained injuries due to the movement and impact within the vehicle. Therefore, the driver's actions or control of the vehicle likely played a significant role in causing the accident.
