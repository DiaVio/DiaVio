The driver of V1 misjudged the gap distance and the speed of V2, resulting in a collision while attempting to make a left turn. Additionally, the driver of V1 was operating the vehicle without a valid driver's license, had a vision impairment as he was not wearing his glasses, and was driving a vehicle in poor condition. These factors contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
