The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and traveled off the right side of the roadway. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, V1 crossed over all lanes before impacting the median wall, suggesting a lack of proper judgment and awareness of the surroundings. The driver's statement of blacking out the events of the crash further supports the notion of driver error and a failure to maintain control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control and stay within the designated lane.
