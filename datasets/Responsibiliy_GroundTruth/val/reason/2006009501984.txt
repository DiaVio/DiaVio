The reason for this is that V1 began to depart its lane to the right for unknown reasons, and as a result, made contact with V2 (the 2001 Toyota Highlander) in lane two. V1 then continued to travel across all travel lanes and the oversized shoulder before departing the roadway and rolling onto its left side. Since V1 initiated the lane departure and made contact with V2, it can be concluded that V1's actions were the primary cause of the crash.
