The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of the driver of V2. The driver of V1 thought that V2 would yield the right-of-way as the traffic light turned yellow, but V2 was intending to continue straight through the intersection. As a result, V1 turned left and collided with the left side of V2. Additionally, V1 proceeded with insufficient clearance, which further contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the false assumption of the other driver's actions and proceeding with insufficient clearance.
