The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while traveling at a high rate of speed. The driver's inability to maintain control and over-correcting led to the vehicle rotating counterclockwise, crossing all lanes of eastbound traffic, and ultimately colliding with the curbed median and a tree on the median. The police reported travel speed of 113 kmph (70 mph) indicates that V1 was exceeding the speed limit of 64 kph (40 mph), which further supports the conclusion that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions.
