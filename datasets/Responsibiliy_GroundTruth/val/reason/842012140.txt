The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the left side of Vehicle 1 (the 2004 Chevrolet Aveo LS 4-door sedan) while it was attempting to turn left onto the roadway. This collision resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1 and caused it to rotate clockwise and come to rest on the south pavement edge of the roadway. Vehicle 2 also came to rest in the middle of the roadway. Since Vehicle 2 was westbound and negotiating a left curve, it had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic, including Vehicle 1. However, it failed to do so and collided with Vehicle 1, causing the accident.
