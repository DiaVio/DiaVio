The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, exceeding the posted speed limit by 10 mph. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the road was very slippery due to rain, indicating that she did not adjust her speed accordingly. The driver's decision error of driving too fast for the wet and curved roadway conditions led to the loss of control and crossing into the opposing lane, ultimately resulting in the collision with the concrete wall.
