The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to not noticing that the traffic in front of him had stopped for the traffic signal. This indicates a lack of attention and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver. Additionally, it is mentioned in the police report that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, which further impairs their ability to operate the vehicle safely. While V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chrysler 300) is mentioned to have been traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, there is no indication that their actions contributed to the cause of the accident. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2 is not coded to this vehicle, suggesting that V2's actions were not a contributing factor. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and driving under the influence of alcohol.
