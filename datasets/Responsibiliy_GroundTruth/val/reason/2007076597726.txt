The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling off the roadway on the right side, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle within the designated lane. - The driver stated that they swerved right to avoid a non-contact vehicle over the centerline, but this action resulted in V1 impacting a stem wall and losing control. - The driver's claim of swerving to avoid another vehicle suggests a failure to properly assess the situation and make appropriate decisions. - The driver's internal distraction, specifically the argument with the passenger, likely contributed to their impaired judgment and inability to react effectively to the situation. - The driver's positive test for alcohol indicates that they were under the influence, which further supports their responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, swerving off the roadway, internal distraction, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
