The reason for this is that V1 ran the red light at the intersection, which is a clear violation of traffic laws. The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by holding her cell phone and being involved in a conversation. This distraction likely contributed to her failure to notice the red light and the approaching V2 (the 1998 Dodge Grand Caravan) from the right. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and her distracted driving are the main factors that led to the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
