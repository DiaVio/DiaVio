The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 initiated a left turn through an opening in the stopped traffic, entering the intersection at the same time as Vehicle 2 (the 1995 Freightliner Luverne fire truck). The frontal plane of Vehicle 2 subsequently struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1, causing a severe near-side impact. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
