The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she overcompensated while trying to avoid the non-contact vehicle that encroached into her lane. This overcompensation led to the loss of control of her vehicle, resulting in the collision with V2 (the Chevrolet Corvette). V1's actions of swerving into the bike lane and then abruptly steering back into her lane at a high rate of speed contributed to the critical pre-crash event and the subsequent collision.
