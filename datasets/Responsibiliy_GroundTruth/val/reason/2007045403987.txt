The driver of V1 made a left turn without a protected left turn arrow into the path of V2 (the Buick LeSabre). The driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 was going to turn right based on the right turn signal, which led to the driver of V1 proceeding with the left turn. However, V2 was actually going straight, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to yield the right of way.
