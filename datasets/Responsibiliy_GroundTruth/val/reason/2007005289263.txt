The reason for this is as follows: - V1 departed the right side of the roadway and continued for a significant distance before the first impact with a tree stump, indicating poor directional control. - V1 continued partially off the right side of the roadway for another distance before the second impact with a mailbox, further demonstrating a lack of control. - V1 then hit two trees before rolling over on the driver's side, indicating a complete loss of control. - The driver of V1 had a BAC of 0.298, which is significantly above the legal limit and indicates alcohol intoxication. - The driver was also taking prescription medications for depression and sleep deprivation, which may have impaired their ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to poor directional control, alcohol intoxication, and the use of prescription medications that may have impaired the driver's ability to safely operate the vehicle.
