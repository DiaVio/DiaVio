The reason for this is that the driver of V1 veered off the right side of the roadway, indicating a driver-related error. Additionally, the driver admitted to drinking alcohol throughout the day at a music festival, which likely impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. The researcher found no evidence of any roadway deficiency, suggesting that the crash was solely caused by the driver's actions.
