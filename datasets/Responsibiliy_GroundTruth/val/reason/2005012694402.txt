The driver of V2 reported that V1 (the Pontiac Montana minivan) changed lanes in front of him and suddenly stopped. However, V2 was traveling at a speed of 64 kmph (40 mph), which may have been too fast for the conditions. This indicates a decision error on the part of V2, as they were unable to respond to the unexpected actions of V1. Additionally, V2's inadequate evasive action suggests that they did not take appropriate measures to avoid the collision. The fact that V2 came to a rest in its original lane of travel also indicates that they were unable to stop in time, further supporting their primary responsibility for the crash. In contrast, V1's actions of changing lanes and decelerating to make a left turn, while potentially unexpected to V2, do not appear to be the primary cause of the crash. V1's unfamiliarity with the area and physical factors such as myopia, hearing impairment, and taking prescription medications may have contributed to the situation, but V2's excessive speed and inadequate response are the main factors leading to the collision.
