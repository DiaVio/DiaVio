The driver of V1 was making a left turn across the eastbound lanes of the roadway. It was reported that the opposing vehicle in the first travel lane had stopped to let V1 turn. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the area and did not see V2, which was traveling in the first travel lane. As a result, V1 turned in front of V2, causing the collision. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within their lane and attempted to brake to avoid the collision but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1's failure to properly recognize and surveil the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
