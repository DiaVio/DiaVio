The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway at a T intersection, drove through a raised concrete curb and uphill grass embankment, struck a parked vehicle, and then continued to strike multiple curbs before ultimately colliding head-on with a tree and coming to a final rest after hitting a chain-link fence pole. This sequence of events suggests that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to navigate the roadway properly, resulting in the series of collisions.
