The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one was stopped at the stop sign, waiting to make a left turn. However, her view of westbound traffic was obstructed by the buses that were stopped in lane one of the westbound roadway. Despite the obstructed view, the driver of vehicle one entered the intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. As a result, the front of vehicle two (the 2005 Ford F-350 pickup truck) struck the left side of vehicle one. Therefore, the inadequate surveillance by the driver of vehicle one is the critical reason for the accident, making them primarily responsible.
