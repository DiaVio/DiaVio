The reason for determining the Nissan Versa as primarily responsible is that the occupant was the driver of the vehicle involved in the impact with the stone and mortar pillar/lamp post. The injuries sustained by the case occupant, including head trauma, chest injuries, rib fractures, and lacerations, were a direct result of the impact with the pillar.
