The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down at a picture just prior to the crash. This internal distraction caused the driver to veer to the right and collide with the parked V2 (1996 Nissan Pathfinder). Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 was not maintaining proper lane position. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain lane position make them primarily responsible for the accident.
