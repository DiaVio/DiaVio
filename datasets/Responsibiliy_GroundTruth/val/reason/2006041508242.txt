The driver of V1 swerved into V2's travel lane, resulting in a head-on collision. The driver of V1 claimed that a minivan at the intersection pulled out and then suddenly stopped, causing him to swerve. However, it was determined that the minivan did not actually pull into the intersection. The driver of V1 panicked and made an irrational and impulsive action when no action was required. Several factors contributed to the driver's error. The driver was engaged in a social conversation with the passenger in the back seat, which likely distracted him from focusing on the road. Additionally, the driver had taken medication prior to his shift, which may have affected his ability to drive safely. The driver was also fatigued, having worked 75 hours that week, and had no formal driver education. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's performance error, panic/freezing, and the presence of multiple contributing factors that impaired his ability to drive safely.
