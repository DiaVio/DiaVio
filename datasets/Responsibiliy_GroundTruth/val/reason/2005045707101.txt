The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to running a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a decision error. This action directly contributed to the collision with Vehicle #2 (the 1995 Ford E-250 cargo van). Additionally, rain was mentioned as an associated factor for both vehicles, but the decision to run a red light was the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1.
