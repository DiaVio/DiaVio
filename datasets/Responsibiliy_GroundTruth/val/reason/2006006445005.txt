The reason for this is that V2 was driving with a suspended license, without insurance, and in an unregistered vehicle. These violations indicate a disregard for traffic laws and safety regulations. Additionally, V2's statement to the police that he had the green light contradicts the statement of V1 (the driver of the 2006 Chevrolet Equinox) who claimed to have had the green light. Without any physical evidence to support either driver's claim, V2's violations and lack of credibility make him the more likely responsible party.
