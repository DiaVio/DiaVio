The driver of V1 attempted to change lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. They falsely assumed that the driver of V2 (the Ford F750 straight truck) would slow down and allow them to make the lane change. This false assumption of the other driver's actions led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their driver-related factor of false assumption of other's actions.
