The driver of V1 was driving in reverse at a high rate of speed, which is considered aggressive driving. This behavior, combined with the fact that the driver was fleeing from an altercation and had bricks thrown at his vehicle, shows a lack of caution and control. Additionally, the driver attempted to make a quick turn into a driveway without applying the brakes, resulting in the vehicle sliding into a utility pole. The driver's actions of driving aggressively, not applying the brakes, and being distracted by looking out the rear back light of the vehicle demonstrate negligence and a failure to exercise reasonable care. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
