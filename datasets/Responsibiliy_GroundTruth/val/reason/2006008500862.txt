The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right and struck a telephone pole, indicating poor directional control. The driver of V1 had a blood alcohol content of 0.177, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. Additionally, the driver had a history of alcoholism and was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash. These factors suggest impaired judgment and reduced driving abilities, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
