The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle two failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She looked left and saw the parked truck obstructing her view of the westbound lanes, but instead of looking left again, she looked right to check for traffic in the eastbound lanes. This failure to recheck the left side of the intersection resulted in her entering the intersection without noticing vehicle one approaching in the westbound lanes, leading to the collision.
