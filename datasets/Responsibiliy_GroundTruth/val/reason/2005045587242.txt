The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before attempting to turn left. The driver stated that she didn't see any approaching traffic, but this lack of proper surveillance led to her turning left when it was not safe to do so. This resulted in the front of Vehicle #1 colliding with the left side of Vehicle #2 (the blue 1995 Nissan Altima), causing the crash.
