The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 left the road on the left side and struck a small metal sign post and a utility pole. - The Critical Precrash Event coded to V1 was 'this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side.' - The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a recognition error of 'internal distraction' as the driver was engaged in kissing the passenger in the center front seat prior to and at the time of the crash. - The driver of V1 was found to have acute alcohol intoxication, which was a contributing factor to the crash. - No avoidance actions were taken by V1. - Police coded 'speed too fast' as a Hazardous Action, indicating that V1 was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the road conditions. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
