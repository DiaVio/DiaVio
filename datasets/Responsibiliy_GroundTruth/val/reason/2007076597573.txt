The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she turned left at the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. Although she stated that she could see behind the turning truck and did not see any other vehicles, she failed to notice the truck coming from the west in the #2 travel lane, which was hidden behind the non-contact truck making the right turn. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event coded for V1 was that she turned with an obstructed view, further highlighting her failure to adequately assess the situation before making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way and turning with an obstructed view.
