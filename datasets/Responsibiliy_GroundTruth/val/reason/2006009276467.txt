The reason for this is that V1 failed to slow down and come to a stop behind V2 (the 1998 Buick LaSabre) when V2 was already stopped in lane one at the intersection. This indicates that V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead and did not see V2 stopped at the intersection. Since no interview was obtained with the driver of V1, it is unclear why they did not see V2. However, the fact that V1 struck the rear of V2 suggests that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or was not paying attention to the traffic ahead. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to stop and avoid colliding with the stopped vehicle in front of them.
