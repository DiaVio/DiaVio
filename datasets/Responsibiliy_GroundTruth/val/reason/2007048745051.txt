The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 stated that she did not see V1 prior to the crash, indicating a failure to properly look and assess the situation before making the left turn. This driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance is the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V2. Additionally, V2's failure to obey the traffic control signal, as indicated by the associated factor of the driver of V1's failure to obey the traffic control signal, further supports V2's primary responsibility for the accident.
