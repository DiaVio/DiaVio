The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at the scenery on the sides of the road instead of paying attention to the traffic ahead. This distraction caused her to not notice that V2 (the 1998 Mercury Grand Marquis) was traveling slower in front of her. Although V1 attempted to brake to avoid the crash, the fact that she was distracted and not maintaining a safe following distance indicates her negligence in causing the collision.
