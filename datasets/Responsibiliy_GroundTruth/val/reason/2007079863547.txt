The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted an illegal maneuver by making a U-turn in an area where the roadway narrows from three lanes to two. This action created a hazardous situation for other vehicles on the road, including V2 (the driver of the Toyota Avalon sedan). While V2 chose an inappropriate avoidance action by passing on the left over double yellow lines, their frustration with V1's driving does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for initiating the illegal maneuver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their illegal U-turn, which resulted in the impact with V2.
