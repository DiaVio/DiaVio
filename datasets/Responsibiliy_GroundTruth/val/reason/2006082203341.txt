The driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road while entering the intersection. He admitted to looking inside the vehicle to drink his coffee and was not expecting a red light. This internal distraction caused him to fail to stop for the traffic control device and fail to look far enough ahead. Additionally, the driver's medical problems and financial issues may have contributed to his lack of focus on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factors of internal distraction and failure to stop for a traffic control device.
