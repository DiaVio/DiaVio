The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection without looking for clearance in the cross street. The driver was distracted by eating and not paying attention to the road, which led to the collision. Additionally, V1 did not attempt to avoid the collision, according to a witness statement. These factors indicate that V1's actions directly caused the accident.
