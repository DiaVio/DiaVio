The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which is classified as a driver-related critical non-performance error. This indicates that the driver's fatigue and lack of sleep directly contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver stated that he normally sleeps only four hours per night and is always tired, further highlighting the driver's negligence in operating the vehicle while fatigued. While there are contributing factors such as the driver's hearing loss, medication side effects, and wet road conditions, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's admission of falling asleep and the direct correlation between fatigue and the crash.
