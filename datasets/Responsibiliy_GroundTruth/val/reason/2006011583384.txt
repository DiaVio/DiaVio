The driver of V1 made a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2, leading to the decision to pull out and turn left in front of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been drinking beer prior to the accident and tested just below the legal state limit for driving under the influence. This impaired judgment likely contributed to the driver's decision-making and ability to accurately assess the situation. While V2 was traveling above the speed limit and stated that he thought V1 was going to stop, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe left turn without properly assessing the oncoming traffic.
