The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a sudden left turn at the last moment without giving the driver of V2 enough time to react and avoid the collision. This abrupt maneuver caused V1 to cross into the path of V2, resulting in the near-side impact. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
