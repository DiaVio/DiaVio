The reason for this is that V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving and drifting across the middle turn lane into the westbound lane, where the collision with V2 (the Honda Accord) occurred. This is supported by the critical pre-crash event for V1, which states that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1's vehicle had crossed into the wrong lane. V2, on the other hand, was driving within their lane and had no time to react or avoid the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 states that the other vehicle (V1) encroached from the opposite direction over the left lane line, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver falling asleep and drifting into the wrong lane, while V2 was an innocent party who had no time to react.
