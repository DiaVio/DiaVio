The driver of V1 stated that they thought the light was green and proceeded into the intersection, ultimately colliding with V2 (2004 Chevy Trailblazer) while making a left turn. The witness at the scene also reported that V1 ran the red light. The Critical Pre-crash Event coded for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling through an intersection, and the Critical Reason coded for V1 is a recognition error, specifically inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe the traffic signal and the presence of V2 before entering the intersection, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to obey the traffic signal and adequately surveil the intersection.
