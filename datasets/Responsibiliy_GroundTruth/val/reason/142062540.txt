The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was traveling in a 'slight' left curve and then crossed into the eastbound lane, traveled off the road, and ultimately collided with a signpost and a large tree. The tire marks indicate that there was no braking during the crash sequence, suggesting that the driver did not attempt to regain control of the vehicle. Additionally, it is mentioned that the front right passenger of Vehicle #1 was not wearing the available manual lap and shoulder belt, which could have contributed to their injuries. Overall, the actions and trajectory of Vehicle #1 indicate that it was the primary cause of the accident.
