The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), which was approaching from the northbound direction without any traffic controls. V1 was making a right turn into the northbound lane without properly assessing the oncoming traffic, resulting in a collision with V2.
