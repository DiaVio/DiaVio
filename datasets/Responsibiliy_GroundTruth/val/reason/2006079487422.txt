The reason for this is that V1 impacted the rear of V2, indicating that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. Additionally, V1's driver refused to be interviewed, providing no information or explanation for their actions leading up to the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," suggesting that V1 failed to react appropriately to the presence of a stopped vehicle in their lane. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2001 Honda Passport) attempted to steer left to avoid the collision, indicating that they were aware of V1 approaching and took evasive action. However, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed," suggesting that V2 may have been traveling at a higher speed than V1, which could have contributed to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and react appropriately to the presence of a stopped vehicle in their lane.
