The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for a traffic control device, specifically running a yellow light, and also had an inadequate surveillance error by not properly looking or seeing V1 approaching the intersection. Additionally, V2 was driving without a valid driver's license, which is an illegal maneuver. These factors indicate that V2's actions and negligence contributed to the collision.
