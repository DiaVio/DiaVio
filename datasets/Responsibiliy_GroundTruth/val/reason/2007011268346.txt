The reason for this is that V1 swerved to the right to avoid hitting the deer but ended up clipping it with the front left corner of the vehicle. As a result, V1 lost control and left the road, ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's decision to swerve instead of maintaining control of the vehicle contributed to the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver was potentially experiencing side effects from her prescribed medication could have impaired her judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the crash.
