The reason for this is that V2 pulled into the path of V1, causing V1 to collide into V2. V2 was turning left at the intersection and entered the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic. It is unclear whether or not V2 saw V1 before entering the intersection. However, V2's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and causing the collision makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
