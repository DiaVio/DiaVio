The reason for this is that V2 departed the right side of the southbound lane, impacting the snow bank, and then overcorrected by swerving to the left, crossing through the turning lane and into the lane of oncoming traffic. This action caused the collision with V1, the 2006 Kia Spectra sedan, which was traveling in the northbound lane and attempted to avoid the impact but was unsuccessful. Therefore, V2's actions of leaving its lane and crossing into oncoming traffic led to the collision and subsequent injuries to the driver of V1.
