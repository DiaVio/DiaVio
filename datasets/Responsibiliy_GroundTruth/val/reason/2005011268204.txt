Reason: V2 was traveling at a speed of 35-40mph on a snow-covered road with icy conditions, which was too fast for the conditions. V2 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not notice V1 slowing down to make a right turn. As a result, V2 collided with the rear of V1. Additionally, it was found that V2 was operating the vehicle with a suspended driver's license, which is a contributing factor to the accident.
