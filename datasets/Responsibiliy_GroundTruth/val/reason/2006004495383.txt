The driver of V1 failed to stop for a posted Stop sign and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event for V1, which states that the vehicle was traveling/crossing over the intersection, and the critical reason for the event was inadequate surveillance - the driver looked but did not see. Additionally, V1 was also engaged in an illegal maneuver by failing to stop for the traffic control device. The driver of V1 was inexperienced, as it was his first time on that road, and had a short time with his license. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the Stop sign and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
