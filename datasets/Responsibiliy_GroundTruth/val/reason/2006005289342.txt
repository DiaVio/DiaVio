The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2 (the Chevrolet pick-up) while it was stopped in the northbound lane. The driver of V1 admitted to attempting to hit the brakes but claimed that she could not stop in time. However, it was determined that brake failure was not the cause of the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .14, which is above the legal limit for driving. The driver was charged with driving under the influence. Therefore, V1's failure to stop, combined with the presence of alcohol in the driver's system and insufficient braking inputs, makes V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
