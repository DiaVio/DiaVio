The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when a small animal ran across the roadway, causing the vehicle to swerve left and subsequently collide with the curb, a tree, and support wires. This overcompensation can be considered a performance error on the part of the driver. Additionally, it is worth noting that the driver was found to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .18 less than an hour after the crash, which is above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. The driver's use of prescription medications and the fact that he was operating the vehicle with an expired driver's license are also contributing factors. Overall, the driver's overcompensation, impaired state due to alcohol, expired license, and use of prescription medications all point to V1 being primarily responsible for the crash.
