The driver of V1 admitted to daydreaming and not paying attention while driving. He stated that he thought he had a green light and drove through the intersection without knowing where he was coming from or where he was going. This indicates a lack of focus and awareness on the part of the driver, which contributed to the collision. Additionally, a witness traveling behind V2 (the driver of the 2004 Ford Taurus) stated that V2 had the green light as it traveled through the intersection. This further supports the conclusion that V1 failed to yield the right of way and entered the intersection when it was not safe to do so. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and failure to obey traffic signals.
