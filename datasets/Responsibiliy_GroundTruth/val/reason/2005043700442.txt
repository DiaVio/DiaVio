The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was driving recklessly and was unlicensed. The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be higher than the posted speed limit, indicating that V1 was driving at an excessive speed. Additionally, V1 steered left of center to avoid parked cars on the narrow roadway, which resulted in the collision with V2. The lack of an interview with the driver of V1 further supports the unknown driver error as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. While V2 (the 2003 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor sedan) had factors such as encroachment from the opposite direction and being in a hurry to respond to a police call, V1's reckless driving and unlicensed status make them primarily responsible for the accident.
