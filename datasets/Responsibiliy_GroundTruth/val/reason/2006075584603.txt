The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol (arrested for DUI) and was distracted at the time of the crash. The driver admitted to looking away from the road and reaching for something, and when he looked up, he realized the vehicles ahead were stopped and applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time. Additionally, information from V1 indicated that the vehicle was exceeding the speed limit by at least 48 kmph (30 mph). These factors, along with the fact that the frontal airbags deployed at impact, suggest that V1 was traveling at a high speed and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, resulting in the rear-end collision.
