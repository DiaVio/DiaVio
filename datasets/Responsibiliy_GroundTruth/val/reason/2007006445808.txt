The reason for this is that V2 driver made an improper left turn, which was confirmed by the police report. Additionally, V2 driver had an obstructed view due to the location of the stopped trolley, which further contributed to the accident. The fact that V2 driver was under the influence of medications that can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and slowed motor skills also raises concerns about their ability to operate a vehicle safely.
