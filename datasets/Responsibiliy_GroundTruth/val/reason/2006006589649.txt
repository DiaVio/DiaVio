The reason for V1's responsibility is that it crossed over the center median and collided with the front of Vehicle two (V2), causing a head-on collision. This action suggests that V1 made an evasive maneuver to avoid the phantom vehicle that allegedly exited a driveway from V1's right. However, in doing so, V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and crossed into oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. It is important to note that the critical pre-crash event coded to V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, suggesting a potential lane departure. This further supports the notion that V1 was not in proper control of the vehicle, leading to the accident. Overall, V1's actions of crossing the center median and colliding with V2 indicate a failure to exercise proper caution and control, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
