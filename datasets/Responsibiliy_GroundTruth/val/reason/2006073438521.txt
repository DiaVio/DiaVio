The reason for this is that V1 lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions, specifically the icy and snow-covered pavement. Additionally, the tread depth of both rear tires of V1 was less than 1 mm, which likely contributed to the lack of traction on the slippery surface. The driver of V1 stated that the vehicle lost control as she entered the curve of the ramp, indicating that she was unable to maintain control of the vehicle in the given conditions.
