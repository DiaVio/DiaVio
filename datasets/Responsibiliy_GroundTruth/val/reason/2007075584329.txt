The driver of V1 admitted to dozing off while driving, which is a clear indication of driver fatigue. This caused him to miss the left curve in the road and run off the right side. Additionally, the driver's medical conditions, such as sleep apnea, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, may have contributed to his drowsiness and impaired ability to react appropriately in the situation. The driver's failure to take necessary precautions, such as using his CPAP machine for sleep apnea, further demonstrates his negligence in ensuring his own alertness and safety on the road.
