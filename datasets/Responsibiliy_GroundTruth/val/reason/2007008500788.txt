The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically on wet roads and in heavy fog. This driver-related factor contributed to V1 losing control, rotating counterclockwise, and ultimately exiting the roadway. Additionally, the driver stated that she had been traveling below the speed limit, but it is mentioned that the curve could have been easily traversed at a slower speed.
