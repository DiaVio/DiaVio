The driver of V1 admitted to glancing down for an unknown reason while driving, which resulted in her not noticing that V2 (the 2004 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 Z71 4x4 pick-up truck) was stopped in the lane ahead. Despite applying full ABS braking, V1 still collided with the back of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and distraction, as well as the false assumption that V2 would continue to proceed.
