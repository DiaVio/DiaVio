The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that he was surprised by the whiteout-like conditions and the vehicles ahead braking. Despite being aware of the poor road conditions and the need to slow down, the driver failed to adjust his speed accordingly. This is evident from the associated factors mentioned, such as driving too fast for the conditions and the presence of black ice on the roadways. Additionally, the driver's loss of vehicle control and subsequent rotation suggests a lack of proper handling and control of the vehicle in adverse weather conditions. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
