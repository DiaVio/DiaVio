The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed of 40 kmph, which was the same as V2's speed. - V1 failed to stop and collided with the back of V2, indicating a lack of attention or inattention on the part of V1. - The driver of V1 admitted to being worried about work-related issues and potentially being on the phone while driving, which suggests a distraction from the task of driving. - Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned fatigue as a factor, having only slept for about four hours. These factors, including inattention, potential distraction, and fatigue, contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
