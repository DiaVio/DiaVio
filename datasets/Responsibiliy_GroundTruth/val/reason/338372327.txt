The reason for this is that V1 departed the right side of the road while negotiating a left curve, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. This initial departure from the road led to a series of subsequent events, including impacts with cinder blocks and a tree, as well as a rollover. The driver of V1, a 27-year-old belted male, suffered minor injuries, suggesting that the severity of the accident was primarily borne by the 23-year-old female right front passenger in V1.
