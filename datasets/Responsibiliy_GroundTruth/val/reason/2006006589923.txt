The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn across the path of V1, which had the right of way. V2 misjudged the gap distance and the speed of V1, assuming that V1 would allow her to continue making the turn. However, when V2 observed V1 seemingly accelerating, she panicked and hit her brakes, resulting in the collision. V1, on the other hand, was traveling within the speed limit and did not have any associated factors coded against the driver. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for making a decision error and false assumption of other's actions. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to misjudgment and a decision error, while V1 did not contribute to the cause of the collision.
