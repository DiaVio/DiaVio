The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver admitted to not seeing V2 (the 1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan) and did not take any avoidance actions. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in a conversation with her passenger and was not completely focused on the driving task. These factors, including inexperience as a driver, contributed to the driver of V1 failing to properly assess the situation and avoid the collision.
