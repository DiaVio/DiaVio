The driver of V1 was preparing to turn left at the intersection and claimed to have checked for oncoming traffic before starting the turn. However, she failed to see V2 approaching from the opposite direction and struck V2 on the left side. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a recognition error, inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 did not adequately observe the traffic before making the left turn. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that she assumed V1 would remain stopped and was taken by surprise when V1 suddenly turned left and hit her on the left front. While V2 made a false assumption, it was V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic that led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
