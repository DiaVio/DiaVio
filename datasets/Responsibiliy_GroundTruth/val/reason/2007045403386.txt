The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap and speed of V2 (the Mazda B2200) approaching from the left. Despite seeing several vehicles approaching, V1 decided to turn right anyway, resulting in V2 striking the left side of V1. This driver-related misjudgment of the gap and speed of the other vehicle led to the collision. Additionally, it should be noted that V1's driver denied any existing health conditions but was taking medications prescribed for various health conditions, which may have affected her judgment and driving ability.
