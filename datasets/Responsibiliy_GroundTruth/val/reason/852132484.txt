The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it became mechanically disabled and was driven to the south shoulder. However, as V1 came to a stop angled southwesterly on the shoulder, it began to roll backwards due to the upgrade in the road. This resulted in V1 crossing lane 3 and entering into lane 2, where it was subsequently impacted by Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1990 Toyota Camry wagon. Therefore, V1's mechanical failure and subsequent movement into the active lanes of traffic contributed to the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
