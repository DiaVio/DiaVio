The reason for this is that the case occupant, who was the unrestrained driver of Vehicle 1, sustained severe injuries including aorta lacerations, atrial lacerations, pulmonary laceration, hemothorax, pulmonary vein laceration, rib fractures, pericardial laceration, and sternum fracture. These injuries were attributed to the chest contacting the steering wheel during the impact. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not properly restrained and failed to take necessary precautions to protect themselves in the event of a collision.
