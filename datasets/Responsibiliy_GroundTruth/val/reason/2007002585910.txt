The reason for this is that V1 drove off the right side of the roadway, struck a pole, crossed over both north and southbound lanes, and ultimately came to rest facing in a northerly direction. The driver of V1 stated that she "blacked out," indicating a loss of consciousness while driving. This suggests that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the multiple collisions and ultimately causing the accident.
