The driver of V2 stated that he was moving to the middle of the lane to properly fit in the tunnel and was checking his mirrors to the back to ensure proper alignment. However, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating inadequate surveillance and poor directional control. On the other hand, V1 (the driver of the 2001 Mercury Sable) was traveling in the first travel lane and attempted to continue in that lane. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, from the adjacent lane over the left lane line. The critical reason for this event was not coded to V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and poor directional control, which resulted in the collision with V1.
