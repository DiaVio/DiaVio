The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was unable to avoid striking the deer, which initiated the sequence of events leading to the crash. The driver's attempt to steer right to avoid the deer was unsuccessful, resulting in the initial impact with the deer. Subsequently, the vehicle started skidding in a clockwise yaw and traveled off the right side of the roadway, ultimately colliding with a wooden mailbox post and a large tree.
