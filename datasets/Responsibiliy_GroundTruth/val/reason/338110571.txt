The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the left road edge and onto the bridge support wall, resulting in the initial impact with the concrete base and subsequent impact with the barrier wall. This driver error led to the counterclockwise rotation and lateral motion of Vehicle 1, causing the center of gravity to shift and initiating the rollover event. Therefore, the actions of the driver of Vehicle 1 directly contributed to the sequence of events leading to the accident.
