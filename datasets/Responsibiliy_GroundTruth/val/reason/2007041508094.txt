The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and entered the intersection without properly looking for oncoming traffic. This is evident from the witness accounts stating that V1 accelerated rapidly from a stop, squealing tires, and the physical evidence at the scene. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by writing a text message, which contributed to the recognition error and inadequate surveillance. While there is no information available about the critical reason for V2's critical event, it is important to note that V2 was traveling in the correct lane and had the right of way at the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and enter the intersection without proper observation makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
