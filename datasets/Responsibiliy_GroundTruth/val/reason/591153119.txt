The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 may have false started, meaning they started to move before it was safe to do so, and continued across the intersection into the path of V2, the 1999 Acura Integra. This action resulted in the left side of V1 being struck by the front of V2, causing the collision.
