The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was not wearing the seatbelt, which is a violation of traffic laws and a contributing factor to the severity of the injuries sustained. Additionally, the driver lost consciousness due to a pre-existing medical condition, which impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. This resulted in V1 driving off the roadway and colliding with the non-breakaway pole.
