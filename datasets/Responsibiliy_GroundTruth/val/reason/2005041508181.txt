The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize that the vehicles in front of him were gradually slowing down. Despite following closely behind V2, V1 did not respond appropriately to the normal deceleration pattern of the lead vehicles. This inattention and recognition error led to V1 being unable to stop in time and colliding with the back of V2, which then pushed V2 into V3.
