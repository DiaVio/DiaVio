The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed (145-177kmph or 90-110mph) and making many lane changes before losing control of the vehicle. The passenger's statement about the driver swerving in and out of traffic further supports the conclusion that the driver of V1 was not exercising the skill ordinarily expected to control the vehicle. Therefore, the driver's performance error and failure to control the vehicle with skill are the primary reasons for the accident.
