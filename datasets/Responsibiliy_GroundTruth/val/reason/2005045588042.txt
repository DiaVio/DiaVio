The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a decision error by assuming that the non-contact vehicle would continue its left turn. This led to incorrect evasive action, causing Vehicle #1 to brake with lockup and lose control. The driver overcompensated, resulting in the vehicle sliding off the right side of the road and colliding with a tree. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the wet conditions, which were further exacerbated by the rain. The wet roads and rain were contributing factors to the crash. It is also worth noting that the driver of Vehicle #1 wears contacts for a nearsighted condition, which may have affected their ability to accurately assess the situation and make appropriate decisions. Overall, the combination of decision errors, incorrect evasive action, traveling too fast for conditions, wet roads, rain, and potential visual impairment due to the driver's nearsightedness all point to Vehicle #1 being primarily responsible for the crash.
