The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was turning left onto the road from a driveway and her view was obstructed by other vehicles. Despite being waved out by another driver, V1 failed to adequately assess the oncoming traffic and did not see V2 (the driver of the 1999 Pontiac Grand Am) until it was too late. V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly judge the traffic conditions resulted in the collision.
