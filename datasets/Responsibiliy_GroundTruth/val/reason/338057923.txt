The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 began to depart from the north pavement edge and attempted to reenter the road, but in doing so, redirected the vehicle back across the travel lanes and into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2006 Chevrolet C2500 HD Silverado). This maneuver caused the collision between the front left areas of both vehicles.
