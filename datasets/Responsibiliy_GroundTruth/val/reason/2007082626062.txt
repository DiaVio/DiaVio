The reason for this is that V1 ignored the yield sign and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2002 Kia Sportage SUV). V1's failure to yield resulted in V2 impacting the right side of V1, causing it to deflect and ultimately collide with a utility pole. Additionally, V1's inadequate surveillance, as evidenced by not seeing V2 until just prior to impact, further supports their responsibility for the collision.
