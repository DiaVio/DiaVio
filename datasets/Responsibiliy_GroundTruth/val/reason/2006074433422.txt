The reason for this is that Vehicle Two was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle Two failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with Vehicle One. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, turning into opposite direction." This suggests that another vehicle, not involved in the accident, turned left in front of Vehicle Two, which may have distracted the driver of Vehicle One. However, this does not absolve the driver of Vehicle Two from their responsibility of ensuring it was safe to make the left turn. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle Two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance while making the left turn at the intersection.
