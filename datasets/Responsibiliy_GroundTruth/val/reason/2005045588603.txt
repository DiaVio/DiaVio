The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 rear-ended Vehicle #2 (the Oldsmobile) just west of the crossover. Vehicle #1 was traveling at a higher speed (85kmph or 52mph) compared to Vehicle #2 (61kmph or 38mph) at the time of the collision. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for Vehicle #1 was a decision error, specifically being too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. This indicates that Vehicle #1 was unable to slow down in time to avoid the collision, suggesting that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or paying adequate attention to the road ahead.
