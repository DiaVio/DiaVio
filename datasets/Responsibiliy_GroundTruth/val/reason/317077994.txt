The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted a left turn into oncoming traffic, which is a violation of traffic laws and a dangerous maneuver. This action directly led to the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1997 Ford Crown Victoria, which was traveling in the correct lane on the divided highway. V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly judge the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision and subsequent injuries.
