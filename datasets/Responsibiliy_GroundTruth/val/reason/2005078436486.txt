The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an external factor, specifically an unknown noise coming from his vehicle. The driver admitted to looking down to his left to investigate the noise, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle and veer off the left side of the roadway. This distraction ultimately led to the rollover accident.
