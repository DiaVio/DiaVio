The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign, waiting for traffic to clear before crossing the eastbound lanes. However, V1 entered the eastbound lanes without ensuring that it was safe to do so, and was struck by the front of V2 (the driver of the Nissan Altima). This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
