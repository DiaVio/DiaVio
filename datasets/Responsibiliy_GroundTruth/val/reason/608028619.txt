The reason for this is that V2 drifted off the edge of the east shoulder and the driver lost control while attempting to return to the roadway. This loss of control resulted in V2 crossing the center line and colliding with the front of the case vehicle (V1). The actions of V2 caused the accident and subsequent injuries to the case occupant.
