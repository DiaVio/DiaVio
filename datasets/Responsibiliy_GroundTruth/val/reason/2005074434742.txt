The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. V2's driver was focused on the turning semi-trailer, which caused an external distraction and resulted in inadequate surveillance. Additionally, both drivers were affected by the sight line restriction caused by the semi-trailer.
