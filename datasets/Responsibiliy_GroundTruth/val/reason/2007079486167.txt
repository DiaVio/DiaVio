The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, illegally passing a slower moving non-contact vehicle on the left, and failed to maintain control of the vehicle while attempting to navigate the curve on the on ramp. This resulted in V1 departing the roadway, colliding with the concrete sound wall, and ultimately causing the subsequent collisions with V2 and V3. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, excessive speed, and poor directional control are all contributing factors to the accident.
