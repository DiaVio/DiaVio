The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 lost control in the slush and ice conditions on the road, indicating a lack of caution and appropriate driving behavior for the road conditions. - The driver of V1 stated that control loss began when a strong gust of wind moved the car, suggesting a lack of control and inability to handle unexpected situations. - The driver of V1 had little experience driving regularly in the area and expressed discomfort and reluctance to discuss her lack of experience. - The dirty windshield of V1 may have contributed to the collision, as it could have hindered the driver's visibility of the road conditions. - The tires of V1 had very little tread, which would have further compromised traction on the icy road. Overall, V1's lack of caution, inability to handle the road conditions, and potential visibility issues due to a dirty windshield make them primarily responsible for the accident.
