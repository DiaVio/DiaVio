The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that they looked left and saw that the light was red, assuming it was safe to proceed. However, they did not look to the right, where Vehicle two (V2) was approaching. This inadequate surveillance by the driver of V1 led to the collision with V2. While V2 was also involved in the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, turning into same direction." This indicates that V2 was already in the intersection and proceeding straight, while V1 turned left into the same direction as V2. Therefore, V2's actions were not the primary cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, which resulted in the collision with V2.
