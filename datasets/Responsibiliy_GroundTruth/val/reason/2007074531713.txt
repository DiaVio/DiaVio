The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling crossing over passing through intersection" and the critical reason for this event was "inadequate surveillance". This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to adequately observe the intersection before proceeding, leading to the collision with V2. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 (the 1995 Ford Explorer) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path", indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, which resulted in the collision with V2.
