The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a right turn from the left right turn lane, which indicates a failure to properly navigate the intersection. As a result, V1 ran off the left side of the roadway and struck the concrete wall head-on. This suggests that the driver of V1 did not follow the appropriate lane positioning and failed to maintain control of the vehicle while making the turn.
