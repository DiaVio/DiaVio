The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1997 Nissan Pathfinder) when attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. V1 stopped at the stop sign and waited for a gap in traffic before proceeding, but misjudged the speed of V2 and pulled out in front of them too suddenly. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, V1 admitted to having known brake problems with his vehicle since he bought it, which could have contributed to the accident. The fact that debris from broken headlights was found in lane two (where V2 was traveling) also suggests that V1 may have crossed into V2's lane during the collision. Overall, V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the gap in traffic, combined with the potential brake problems and evidence of crossing into V2's lane, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
