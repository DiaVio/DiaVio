The reason for this is that V1's brakes had failed, and the driver attempted to steer between V2 and V3 to avoid a serious crash. However, in doing so, V1 made contact with both V2 (the Chevrolet Tahoe) and V3 (the 2005 Pontiac Sunfire), causing the crash. The driver of V1 admitted to realizing the brake failure and trying to prevent a serious crash, but the fact remains that the brake failure ultimately led to the collision.
