The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead (V2) and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. The driver of V1 observed V2 stopped ahead and began to slow down, but due to being unfamiliar with the manual transmission, initially used the clutch instead of the brake. This delay in applying the brake resulted in V1 striking the back of V2.
