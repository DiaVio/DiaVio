The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the 2003 Dodge Caravan mini van). This indicates a driver-related factor and suggests that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was an unlicensed driver with only 1 year of driving experience. This lack of experience may have contributed to the driver's misjudgment and inability to properly assess the situation. Although V2 is mentioned to have encroached over the left lane line, this is categorized as an "other vehicle encroachment" and is not considered the critical reason for the accident. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the collision.
