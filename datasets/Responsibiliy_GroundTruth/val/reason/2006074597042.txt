The driver of Vehicle one was under the influence of alcohol, tested positive at .254, which is significantly above the legal limit. Additionally, the driver was taking prescription medications that may have impaired their ability to perform the driving task as normally expected. The driver's medical conditions, including bipolar disease and intermediate explosive behavior, may have also affected their ability to control the vehicle. Furthermore, the driver was in a hurry and driving in a reckless manner, attempting to change lanes abruptly without proper control. This resulted in Vehicle one departing the roadway and colliding with a utility pole. The poor condition of the vehicle's transmission, which could only be put in first gear, may have also contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control. Overall, the combination of impaired driving, reckless behavior, and potential medical conditions make Vehicle one primarily responsible for the crash.
