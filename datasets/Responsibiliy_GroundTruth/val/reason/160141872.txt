The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a U-turn from the southbound lanes onto the northbound lanes, causing the trailer to take up all three northbound lanes. This action created an obstruction in the roadway, which V1, the 2002 Toyota Corolla sedan being driven by the 19-year-old occupant, collided with. V2's U-turn maneuver without ensuring a clear path for oncoming traffic resulted in the crash.
