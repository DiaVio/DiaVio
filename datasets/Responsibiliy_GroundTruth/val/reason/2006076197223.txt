The reason for this is that V1's brakes failed, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. The driver, who did not possess a driver's license, was aware of the brake issue as she had to pump them several times to stop the vehicle. Despite this, she continued to drive the truck and failed to use the emergency brake when the brakes completely failed. This lack of experience and failure to take appropriate action in response to the known brake issue contributed to the rear-end collision with V2 and subsequently V3.
