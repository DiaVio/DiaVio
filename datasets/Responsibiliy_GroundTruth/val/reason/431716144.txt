The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the right side surface of Vehicle 1, causing moderate damage and re-directing both vehicles towards the southwest sector of the intersection. The impact occurred as both vehicles entered the intersection, indicating that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way or violated a traffic signal.
