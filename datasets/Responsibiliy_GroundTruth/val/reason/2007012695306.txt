The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, who was approaching the intersection in the opposite direction. V2's decision to turn with an obstructed view, due to the line of cars waiting to turn northbound, and his distraction of talking on his cell phone contributed to the collision. Additionally, V2 stated that he did not see V1 prior to impact, indicating a lack of awareness and failure to exercise caution while making the left turn.
