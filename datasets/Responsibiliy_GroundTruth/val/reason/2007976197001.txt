The reason for V1's responsibility is the "degraded braking capability" of the vehicle. The driver stated that when she tried to brake, the pedal went to the floor and did not respond. Brake fluid was found leaking at the crash location, indicating a potential issue with the braking system. The fact that the brakes did not respond and the vehicle rotated clockwise off the road edge suggests a failure in the braking system, leading to the loss of control and the subsequent crash.
