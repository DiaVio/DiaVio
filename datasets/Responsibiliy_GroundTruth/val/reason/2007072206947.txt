The driver of V1 was traveling the wrong way on a one-way roadway, which was a driver-related factor and an associated factor in the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not realize she was on a one-way roadway and did not see V2 prior to the crash. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1.
