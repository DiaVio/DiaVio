The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not looking at the roadway at the time of the crash. The police accident report states that the driver of V1 was reaching down for a dropped item, which indicates an internal distraction. This distraction caused V1 to strike the rear of V2 (the Nissan Quest minivan) while it was stopped in traffic. Additionally, the associated factors of inexperience and rush hour congestion on the roadway contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
