The driver of V1 was traveling in the wrong direction, crossing over the center lane towards oncoming traffic, and ultimately colliding with V2 (the 2007 Kia Spectra) and V3 (the 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe). The critical reason for V1's involvement in the collision was determined to be driver-related factors, specifically inattention and poor directional control. The driver of V1 was daydreaming, distracted by personal problems, fatigued, and had trouble sleeping, which led to their failure to observe V2 prior to impact and their subsequent incorrect positioning on the roadway.
