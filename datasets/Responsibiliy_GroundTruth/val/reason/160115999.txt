The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1's driver lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle yawing and rotating clockwise. V1 then ran off the left side of the road, causing the left side tires to dig into the ground and the vehicle to roll. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the roadway ultimately led to the collision with the trees.
