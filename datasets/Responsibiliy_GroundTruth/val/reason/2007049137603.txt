The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed (between 80-97 kmph or 50-60 mph) as he approached the intersection and attempted an abrupt left turn. This indicates that V1 was driving too fast for the curve/turn, which was the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver's statement about being chased by an unknown vehicle does not absolve him of responsibility for driving at an excessive speed and making an unsafe maneuver. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factor of driving too fast for the curve/turn.
