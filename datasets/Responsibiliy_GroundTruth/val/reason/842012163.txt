The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the pavement edge, sideswiped a street sign post, sideswiped a stop sign post, and ultimately collided with a large diameter tree. These actions indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the series of impacts and the severe damage caused by the collision with the tree.
