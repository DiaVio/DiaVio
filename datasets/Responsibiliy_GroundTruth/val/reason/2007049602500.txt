The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe distance from V2 and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. V1 admitted to being distracted by singing with her children, which likely contributed to her failure to notice V2 stopped in front of her. Additionally, V1 did not detect V2 until it was right in front of her, indicating a lack of attention and failure to look far enough ahead. Since V2 left the scene without identification, it is not possible to assign any responsibility to the driver of V2.
