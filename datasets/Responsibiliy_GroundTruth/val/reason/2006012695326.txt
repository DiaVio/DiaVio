The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed (153kmph or 95 mph) in response to a call, which is significantly above the posted speed limit. Additionally, V1 attempted to pass V2 on the left while V2 was in the process of making a left turn into a commercial driveway. This indicates a failure to yield the right-of-way and a lack of proper judgment and caution on the part of the driver of V1. While V2's driver was cited for inadequate surveillance, it is important to note that V2 was traveling at a much slower speed (2-16kmph or 1-10 mph) and had its blinker on to indicate the intention to make a left turn. V2 did not see V1 approaching at a high speed, which suggests that V1's excessive speed and sudden attempt to pass were contributing factors to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to excessive speed, failure to yield the right-of-way, and a lack of proper judgment and caution.
