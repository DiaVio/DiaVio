The driver of Vehicle #1 attempted to turn left across the southbound lanes of the road, relying on the motion of the non-contact vehicle to proceed. However, the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately survey the intersection and did not see Vehicle #2 approaching. This decision error, along with the obstructed view caused by the non-contact vehicle, led to the collision. While Vehicle #2 was cited for driving on a revoked license, it is important to note that the critical reason for the crash was not coded to this vehicle. Vehicle #2 did not see Vehicle #1 until impact and made no avoidance actions, suggesting that Vehicle #2 was unable to react in time due to the obstructed view and the traffic flow pattern. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the decision error and inadequate surveillance, while Vehicle #2's involvement was a result of the obstructed view and traffic flow pattern.
