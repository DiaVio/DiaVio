The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, but failed to yield the right of way to V2, who was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's driver admitted to being distracted by talking on the phone and not seeing anyone coming before making the turn. Additionally, V1's driver stated that he accelerated in an attempt to avoid the collision, indicating that he was aware of the potential danger but failed to take appropriate action in a timely manner. On the other hand, V2's driver stated that she applied the brakes and steered left in an attempt to avoid V1, indicating that she took evasive action to prevent the collision. However, despite her efforts, she was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their driver's distraction.
