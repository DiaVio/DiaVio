The reason for this is that the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #1 was "Driver Related Factor, Misjudgment of Gap or Other's Speed." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a mistake in judging the speed or distance of Vehicle #2, resulting in the collision during the left turn. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 refused to return messages and a message left at his door, which suggests a lack of cooperation and responsibility. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment and failure to yield.
