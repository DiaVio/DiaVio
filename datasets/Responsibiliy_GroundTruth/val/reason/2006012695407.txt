The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to see and recognize that V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet pick-up) was stopped at the stop sign due to the glare from the setting sun. V1 admitted that they did not see V2 until the last second and could not avoid the collision. Additionally, V1 stated that they thought V2 had already merged onto the highway, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness of their surroundings. While V2 also mentioned that the sun glare made it hard to see, they were stationary and had not proceeded before being hit from behind. Therefore, V2's responsibility is secondary in this case. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to observe and recognize the stationary vehicle in front of them, resulting in the collision.
