The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. The driver of V1 stated that a non-contact vehicle immediately ahead of them swerved into another lane, revealing the stopped car (V2) in their lane. However, V1 failed to avoid the collision and struck the back of V2. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the sudden appearance of the stopped car. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other vehicle in lane traveling in the same direction with lower steady speed," further suggesting that V1 was not maintaining an appropriate distance from the vehicle ahead. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to respond to the unexpected actions of the vehicles ahead.
