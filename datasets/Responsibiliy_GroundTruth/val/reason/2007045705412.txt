The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included overcast skies, moderate rainfall, and wet roads. Additionally, the driver had low tire tread and pressure on one separate tire, which further contributed to the loss of control. The driver's medication for high blood pressure and asthma may have also affected their ability to react appropriately in the situation.
