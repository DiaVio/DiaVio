The reason for this is that V2 lost control on the icy roadway and began a counter-clockwise yaw, partially entering the left lane in front of V1. This action by V2 caused V1 to skid longitudinally and partially enter the right lane, resulting in the impact between the front of V1 and the left back corner of V2. Therefore, V2's loss of control and subsequent movement into the path of V1 initiated the chain of events that led to the accident.
