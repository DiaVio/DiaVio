The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the center turn lane, then veered into southbound lane two, back into the turn lane, and then back into the southbound lanes before ultimately going off the right side of the road and striking a utility pole. This indicates poor directional control by the driver of V1, which is a driver-related factor and a violation of the skill ordinarily expected while operating a vehicle. Additionally, the driver's positive results for benzodiazepines, cocaine, and opiates suggest that drug use was an associated factor in this crash, further contributing to the driver's impaired ability to control the vehicle.
