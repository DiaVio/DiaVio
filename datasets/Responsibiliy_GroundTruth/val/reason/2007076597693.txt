The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down at the windshield wiper control, which caused her to veer into the parking lane and collide with V2 (the parked 1983 Ford F150 pickup). This distraction is considered a driver-related factor and indicates that V1 was not paying proper attention to the road. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of her vehicle and her distraction while driving make her primarily responsible for the accident.
