The driver of V1 admitted to consuming a significant amount of alcohol before getting behind the wheel, with a BAC level of 0.189%. This indicates that he was driving under the influence, which impaired his judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, he stated that his view of V2 was obstructed by a camper shell on his truck, further contributing to his misjudgment of the gap or speed of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impaired state, misjudgment of the gap or speed of V2, and obstructed view.
