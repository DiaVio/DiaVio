The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she did not notice V2, even though there were no sight restrictions. This indicates that she did not properly check for oncoming traffic before entering the intersection. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," further supporting the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
