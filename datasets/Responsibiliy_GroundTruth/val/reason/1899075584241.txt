The driver of V1 was distracted and reached for her cigarettes and lighter on the front seat, taking her attention away from the road. This internal distraction caused V1 to veer off the right side of the road and collide with the guardrail. The driver's actions directly led to the initial impact and subsequent collision with the second guardrail. Additionally, the driver's previous involvement in a crash and the medications she was taking may have impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle.
