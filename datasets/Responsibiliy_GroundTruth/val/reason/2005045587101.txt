The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to not maintaining a safe following distance and not paying enough attention to the road ahead. He stated that he glanced over his right shoulder to check for a break in traffic and when he looked forward again, he realized that the traffic ahead had come to a stop. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of Vehicle #1's driver. Additionally, the police charged the driver of Vehicle #1 with following too closely, further supporting the conclusion that Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
