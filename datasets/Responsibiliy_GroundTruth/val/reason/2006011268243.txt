The reason for this is that the driver of V1 ignored the red traffic signal and entered the intersection, despite all other traffic stopping for the left turn portion of the signal. The witness also stated that V1 entered the intersection as if she never noticed that the light was red. Violating the traffic control device was coded as an associated factor for V1.
