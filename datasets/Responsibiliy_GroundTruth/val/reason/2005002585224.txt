The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 entered the roadway from the right into the path of Vehicle #2 (GMC Vandura) to execute an illegal U-turn. Vehicle #2 braked and steered left to avoid a collision, but still ended up striking Vehicle #1. Although Vehicle #2 could have potentially contributed to the crash by not coming to a complete stop at the traffic light, the main responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for making an illegal maneuver and failing to adequately surveil the road before executing the U-turn.
