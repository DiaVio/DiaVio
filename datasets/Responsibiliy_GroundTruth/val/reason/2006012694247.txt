The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was stopped at the stoplight in lane two, intending to turn left at the intersection. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before starting the left turn. - V1 was distracted by talking to her friend and looking at her passenger, which contributed to her inadequate surveillance. - V1's inexperience as a driver also played a role in the crash. - V1 did not have enough time to attempt an avoidance maneuver when she noticed V2 approaching quickly. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance, internal distraction, and driver inexperience make her primarily responsible for the crash.
