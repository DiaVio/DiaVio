The reason for this is as follows: - V2 was speeding through the intersection at the time of the crash, which indicates a violation of the speed limit and a disregard for traffic laws. - The driver of V2 admitted to consuming alcohol and taking sleeping pills in an attempt to harm himself, which impaired his ability to operate a vehicle safely. - V2 had a minor crash prior to this incident, suggesting a pattern of reckless driving behavior. - The driver of V2 had Tetrahydrocannabinol (marijuana) and Benzodiazepines in his system, further impairing his judgment and reaction time. These factors demonstrate that V2's actions and condition significantly contributed to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
