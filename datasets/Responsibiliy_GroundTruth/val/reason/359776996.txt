The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which involved an approximately 140-degree turn. V2, the 1998 Buick Century four-door sedan, was southbound and entered the intersection. The front of V2 impacted the right side of V1, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1 rotated clockwise and rolled backwards towards the southwest corner of the intersection, indicating that V1 was not able to complete the left turn safely. The impact with the stop sign post further suggests that V1 was not able to complete the turn properly. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the actions of the vehicles involved, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
