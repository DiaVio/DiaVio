The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of other road users. They thought that the other vehicle (V2) had a red light and would yield the right of way to them. However, this assumption was incorrect, as V2 was approaching the intersection intending to go straight. As a result, V1 proceeded to make a left-hand turn just seconds before V2 entered the intersection, leading to the collision between the two vehicles.
