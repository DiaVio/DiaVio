The reason for this is that the driver of the Case Vehicle allowed the vehicle to drift to the left, crossing lanes and mounting the raised curb. This indicates a lack of control and attention on the part of the driver, leading to the collision with the steel sign/lamp post. Additionally, evidence at the scene suggests that the driver began braking as the vehicle mounted the curb, indicating a delayed reaction to the situation.
