The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before initiating the left turn. She looked right, saw the road was clear, then looked left and saw that the road was clear as well. However, she failed to look left again before pulling out, which resulted in her not noticing the approaching traffic from the nearby light. This inadequate surveillance led to her initiating the turn when it was not safe to do so, causing the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's attempt to avoid the collision by accelerating and turning left was unsuccessful, further contributing to the accident. The force of the initial acceleration caused V1 to continue forward on its collision course, resulting in the vehicle running off the road and ultimately colliding with a tree. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and inadequate evasive action.
