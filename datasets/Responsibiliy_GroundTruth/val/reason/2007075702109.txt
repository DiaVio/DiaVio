The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see that the traffic light was red. This failure to observe the red light led to V1 entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that the sun glare made it difficult to determine the color of the traffic light. However, this does not absolve the driver of their responsibility to ensure that it is safe to proceed through the intersection. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the red light and proceed with caution makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
