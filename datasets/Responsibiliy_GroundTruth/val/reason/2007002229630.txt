The driver of Vehicle #1 was making a left turn from a retail driveway and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver's medical conditions and the use of medications with side effects of drowsiness, dizziness, and sleepiness may have impaired her ability to properly assess the situation and make a safe left turn. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
