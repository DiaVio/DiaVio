The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop when it crested a hill and found V2 and V3 stopped in a long line of traffic. As a result, V1's front impacted the rear of V2, causing a chain reaction where V2 was forced forward and impacted the rear of V3. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles in front, resulting in the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was unable to stop despite being equipped with a 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt, as well as having the available airbags deploy. This suggests that the driver of V1 may have been driving at an excessive speed or not paying sufficient attention to the road conditions, contributing to the accident. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the driver's inability to stop in time, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
