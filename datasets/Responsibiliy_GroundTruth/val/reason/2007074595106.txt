The driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by eating ice cream while driving and stated that she did not see V1 prior to the crash. This indicates a lack of attention and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," further suggesting that V2 was not properly observing the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1. Therefore, V2's distracted driving and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
