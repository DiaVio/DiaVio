The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to taking her eyes off the road and being internally distracted while placing an object on the dashboard. This distraction likely caused her to veer off the right side of the road, striking a mailbox, and then subsequently veer off the left side of the road, striking a tree. The driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the accident.
