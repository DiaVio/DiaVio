The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed and failed to stop or slow down in time to avoid colliding with the rear end of V2, which had stopped at the intersection due to the traffic light. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or paying attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision.
