The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it crossed the double yellow center lane lines, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), the metro bus. This indicates that V1 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain its proper position on the road, leading to the accident. Additionally, V1's front left impact with V2 suggests that V1 was the one who initiated the collision.
