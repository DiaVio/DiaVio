The driver of V1 made a left turn from the left turn only lane and crossed into the southbound lanes, striking the left side of V2 (the Ford F150 pick-up truck). The driver of V1 admitted to not realizing that he had crossed into the southbound lanes, indicating a performance error of poor directional control. Additionally, the driver of V1 had been driving a vehicle the size of the Blazer for 18 months, suggesting that they should have been familiar with its handling and dimensions. On the other hand, V2 was driving in their designated lane and was in the process of changing lanes when the collision occurred. The driver of V2 stated that they observed V1 fishtailing and heading towards their vehicle, indicating that they were not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their poor directional control and failure to stay within their designated lane while making a left turn.
