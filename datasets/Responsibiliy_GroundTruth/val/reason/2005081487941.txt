The reason for this is that Vehicle One lost control and departed the on-ramp, crossed all three lanes, and impacted the concrete median. The presence of snowy and icy road conditions, combined with the low tread depth on the left front tire of Vehicle One, likely contributed to the loss of control. However, since there is no driver interview and the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event is unknown, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the control loss. Nonetheless, Vehicle One's actions and the condition of the vehicle suggest that it bears primary responsibility for the collision.
