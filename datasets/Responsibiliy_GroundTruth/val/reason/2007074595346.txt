The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the roadway.

Additionally, the driver's focus on her dental problems and the distraction of the dog were associated factors in the crash, further indicating that the driver's actions contributed to the loss of vehicle control and subsequent collision with the utility pole.
