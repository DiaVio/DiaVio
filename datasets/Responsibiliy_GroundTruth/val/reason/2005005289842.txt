The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was intoxicated, as indicated by the smell of alcohol on the driver and the failed field sobriety test. Intoxication impairs judgment, reaction time, and overall driving ability, making it highly likely that the driver's impairment contributed to the misjudgment of the other vehicle's gap or speed, resulting in the collision.
