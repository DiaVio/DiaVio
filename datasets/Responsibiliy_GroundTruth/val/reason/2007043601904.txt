The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 23-year-old male without a driver's license, entered the westbound lane and struck the left side of V2. This action caused V2 to spin and collide with a mailbox. Following the sideswipe collision with V2, V1 continued east in the westbound lane and struck V3 head-on. V1's actions of crossing into the opposite lane and causing the initial collision with V2 demonstrate a clear violation of traffic laws and negligence. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted internally, which further supports their responsibility for the crash.
