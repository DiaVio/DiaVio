The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle fell asleep at the wheel, which resulted in the case vehicle striking V2 in the back end. Falling asleep while driving is a negligent act and can be considered a form of driver inattention or impairment. As a result, the driver of the case vehicle is primarily responsible for the accident.
