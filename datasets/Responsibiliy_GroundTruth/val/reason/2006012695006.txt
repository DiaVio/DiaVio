The reason for this is that V2 made an unsafe maneuver by attempting to make a U-turn without adequately surveilling the surrounding traffic. This action caused confusion for the driver of V1 (the Buick Lesabre) who believed V2 would continue in lane one. As a result, V1 collided with the left side of V2. Therefore, V2's inadequate surveillance and unsafe U-turn attempt led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
