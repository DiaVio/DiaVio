The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was making a left turn from a private driveway onto the roadway and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver admitted to looking right and left but not checking back to the right before proceeding with the turn. This lack of proper surveillance resulted in the collision with Vehicle two (the 2004 Dodge Neon). Therefore, the inadequate surveillance by the driver of Vehicle one led to the collision and makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
