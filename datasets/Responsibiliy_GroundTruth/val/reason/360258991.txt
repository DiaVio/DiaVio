The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 encountered a deer in the road and made a series of steering maneuvers that resulted in the vehicle losing control. The driver initially braked and steered left, causing V1 to partially enter the northbound lane. However, the driver then overcorrected by steering right, leading to a clockwise yaw and V1 veering towards the west shoulder. V1 ultimately departed the roadway, impacting the embankment and causing the vehicle to rotate and rollover. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and respond appropriately to the presence of the deer. The driver's overcorrection and subsequent loss of control resulted in the accident and subsequent injuries to the occupants.
