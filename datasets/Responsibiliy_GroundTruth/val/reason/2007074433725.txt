The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 "lost control" of the vehicle, as stated by the driver herself. The driver's poor directional control, failing to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, was identified as the critical reason for the crash. This indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle traveling off the left side of the road and ultimately colliding with the jersey barrier.
