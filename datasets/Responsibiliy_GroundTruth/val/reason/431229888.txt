The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control while trying to avoid a deer in the road. This resulted in V1 crossing over into the northbound travel lane and ultimately colliding with a tree. The loss of control and subsequent collision were the direct consequences of V1's actions in response to the deer in the road.
