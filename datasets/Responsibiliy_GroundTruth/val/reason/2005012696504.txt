The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Chevrolet Cavalier, was turning left at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V1, the Oldsmobile Alero. V2 thought that they could beat V1 through the light, but ended up being struck by V1's front side. Therefore, V2's decision error and misjudgment of the situation led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
