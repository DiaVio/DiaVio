The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the police vehicle and stated that the stairs and elevator used to access the overhead rail blocked his view. Additionally, the police report and witness account both stated that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, indicating a disregard for the traffic signal. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver and failure to obey the traffic signal make them primarily responsible for the accident.
