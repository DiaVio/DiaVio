The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection and continued through the intersection, ultimately leaving the street and colliding with parked cars in a parking lot. V1 then proceeded to collide with a fixed compactor and various other objects before coming to a final rest. The driver of V1 was the only person in the vehicle and sustained serious injuries. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and subsequent collisions indicate that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
