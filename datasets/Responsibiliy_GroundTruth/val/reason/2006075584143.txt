The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high speed of 72 kph (45 mph) on a wet road with poor visibility due to darkness and rain. Additionally, the driver was distracted by adjusting the CD player and was under the influence of alcohol with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.244. The driver's actions of passing vehicles on both the left and right sides, as well as crossing a double yellow line, further demonstrate a disregard for traffic laws and safety.
