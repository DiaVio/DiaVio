The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, an eighteen-year-old female, failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. She steered to the right at the last minute to avoid a non-contact vehicle, but ended up departing the eastbound lane and striking a tree. This indicates poor directional control on the part of the driver. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver did not see the other vehicle, which suggests a lack of awareness and attentiveness while driving. The driver's inexperience, as she had only been driving for about one year, and the distraction caused by the conversation with her sister about driving a rental vehicle further contribute to her responsibility for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and other driver-related factors.
