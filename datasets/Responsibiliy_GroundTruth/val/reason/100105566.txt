The driver of V1 pulled into the intersection intending to turn left without yielding the right of way to the oncoming Vehicle 2 (V2). This resulted in V2 colliding with the left side of V1. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and make a safe left turn.
