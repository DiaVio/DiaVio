The driver of V1 admitted that he did not realize that V2 was stopped in front of him because he was distracted, looking to his right at other vehicles stopped to exit the cemetery. This external distraction caused him to fail to notice the stopped vehicle in front of him, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was stopped in lane one, waiting to make a left turn into a private driveway. Although he mentioned being upset due to a family matter (the death of a relative), this emotional state does not appear to be a contributing factor to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to notice the stopped vehicle in front of him.
