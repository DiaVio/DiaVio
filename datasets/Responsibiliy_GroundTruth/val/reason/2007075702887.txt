The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were driving in the left turn lane and proceeded with the left turn without properly observing the oncoming traffic. This is evident from the fact that V1 impacted the front of V2, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, which was traveling straight in the opposite direction. Additionally, there is compelling evidence to suggest that the driver of V1 was under the influence of marijuana at the time of the crash. The driver's bloodshot eyes, talkativeness, and the statement made by one of the occupants of V1 about turning themselves in all indicate possible impairment due to drug use. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn and the potential impairment from marijuana use.
