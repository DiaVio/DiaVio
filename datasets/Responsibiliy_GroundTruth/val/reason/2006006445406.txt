The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was distracted and engaged in conversation with the passenger, which contributed to the inattention and inability to regain control of the vehicle. Furthermore, the driver's lack of experience and discomfort with driving the SUV also played a role in the crash.
