The reasons for this are as follows: 1. V1 departed its lane to the left, crossed all travel lanes, and impacted V2 head-on. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle and failed to stay within their designated lane. 2. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded as "This vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." This further supports the fact that V1 was not driving within their lane. 3. The critical reason for the event was attributed to V1 and coded as "Driver-related decision error, too fast for curve/turn." This suggests that V1 was driving at a very high rate of speed, which was inappropriate for the curved stretch of the road they were on. 4. The blood test results for the driver of V1 showed a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) of 0.28, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This indicates that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, impairing their ability to drive safely. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to maintain their lane, driving at a high rate of speed for the curve, and being under the influence of alcohol.
