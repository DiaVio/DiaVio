The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn. Despite briefly stopping and looking left and right, the driver did not see V2 until just before the impact. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming traffic. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was disabled and taking a strong prescription pain killer. This could have impaired the driver's judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the inadequate surveillance and inability to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and the presence of oncoming traffic, combined with potential impairment, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
