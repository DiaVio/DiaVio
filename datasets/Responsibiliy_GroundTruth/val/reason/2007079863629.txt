The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted a u-turn without adequately surveilling the road, which is classified as a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. This means that V1 failed to look or looked but did not see the approaching motorcycle (V2) before making the u-turn. Additionally, V1 was conversing with a passenger and looking rearward at an unspecified location, further contributing to their failure to notice the motorcycle. Therefore, V1's illegal u-turn and inadequate surveillance, along with their inattention and the darkness, led to the collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
