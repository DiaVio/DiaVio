The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep while driving, which led to the vehicle veering off the right side of the roadway, hitting a rock wall, and rolling over. Falling asleep while driving is a critical non-performance error and a clear violation of safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver had only been awake for 6 hours before the crash, indicating possible fatigue and lack of sufficient rest.
