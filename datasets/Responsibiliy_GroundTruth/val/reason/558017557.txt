The reason for this is that V2 was approaching the intersection on the intersecting roadway while the case vehicle, V1, was already stopped at the four-way stop controlled by stop signs. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 and collided with V1's left side as it entered the intersection. This indicates that V2 did not adhere to the traffic rules and regulations governing the right of way at a four-way stop intersection.
