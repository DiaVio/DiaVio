The reason for this is that V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from adjacent lane (same direction) - over left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the lane of V1 (the 1990 Saab 900). As a result, V1's right side struck the left side of V2. Although the driver of V1 was also involved in a critical pre-crash event, the reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown." Without further information about V1's actions or behavior, it cannot be determined if V1's actions contributed significantly to the crash. Therefore, based on the available information, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to encroaching into the adjacent lane and causing the collision with V1.
