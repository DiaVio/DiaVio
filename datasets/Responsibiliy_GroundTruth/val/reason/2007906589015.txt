The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound and failed to stop for a traffic control device, which is an illegal maneuver. This indicates that V2 ran a red light, causing the collision with V1, which had the right of way. Additionally, the driver of V2 fled the scene after the crash, further suggesting their responsibility for the incident.
