The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that she did not notice V2 traveling ahead of the two vehicles she saw coming from her left. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to properly assess the traffic situation before proceeding with the turn. As a result, V1 collided with the right rear side of V2, causing it to roll over. In summary, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to notice the presence of V2 led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
