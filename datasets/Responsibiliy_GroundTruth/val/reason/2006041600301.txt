The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 48kmph (30 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 40kmph (25 mph). Additionally, V1 was found to be driving too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the associated factor coded in the report. Furthermore, V1 was also found to be at fault due to driver inattention, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to pay proper attention to the road and the actions of the vehicle in front (V2), resulting in the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Neon) was stopped in lane one, waiting to turn left into the gas station. Although V2 was cited for inexperience, as she had only been driving for a year, the critical reason for the crash was not coded to this vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to exceeding the speed limit, driving too fast for the conditions, and driver inattention.
