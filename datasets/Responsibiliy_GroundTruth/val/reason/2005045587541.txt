The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 admitted to looking down at his cell phone momentarily and not paying attention to the road. When he looked back up, Vehicle #1 (the 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier) was approaching from his front left. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that he could have applied his brakes sooner but assumed that Vehicle #1 was going to stop. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle #2's distraction and failure to react in a timely manner contributed to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
