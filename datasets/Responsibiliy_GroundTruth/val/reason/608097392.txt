The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it crossed the center-line, drove off the left side of the road, and ultimately collided with a tree in a left, off-set, frontal-impact mode. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which may have contributed to the severity of the impact.
