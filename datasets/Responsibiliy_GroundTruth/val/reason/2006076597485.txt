The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep before the crash occurred. Falling asleep while driving is a serious driver-related factor that significantly impairs a driver's ability to safely operate a vehicle. In this case, the driver's drowsiness caused her to drift off the road and ultimately crash into a rock embankment and a guardrail. The fact that the driver was on a long trip and felt sleepy further supports the conclusion that driver fatigue was a contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of 113 kmph for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling above the posted speed limit, which may have also played a role in the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
