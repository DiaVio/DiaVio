The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to not adequately surveilling the roadway before making a left turn at the intersection. She stated that she looked both ways but did not see any vehicles or lights. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as "driver related factor, inadequate surveillance, failed to look, looked but did not see." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2. On the other hand, the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 (1991 Toyota Corolla) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment, from crossing street turning into opposite direction." However, the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle, suggesting that Vehicle #2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance.
