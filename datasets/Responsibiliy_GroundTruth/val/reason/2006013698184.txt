The driver of V1 admitted to being tired and not having slept in 24 hours, which likely impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. Additionally, she was distracted by reaching down to put a CD in the CD player, which further diverted her attention from the road. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to notice the stopped utility vehicle in front of her. Furthermore, the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol level of .209, which is significantly above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This suggests that she was driving under the influence of alcohol, further impairing her judgment and reaction time. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2006 International utility vehicle) was properly stopped with its yellow warning lights on, indicating that it was not at fault for the crash. The driver of V2 even noticed that V1 was not going to stop and braced for the impact, indicating that he took appropriate action to mitigate the consequences of the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to a combination of fatigue, distraction, and driving under the influence of alcohol.
