The driver of V-1 admitted to entering the intersection on a red light, which is an illegal maneuver and a disregard of the traffic control device. This action directly caused the collision with V-2. Additionally, the witness corroborated this statement by confirming that V-1 failed to stop for the red light. Therefore, V-1's failure to obey the traffic signal and stop at the red light makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
