The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a seventeen-year-old female, was traveling above the speed limit and admitted to driving 16-32 kmph (10-20 mph) over the speed limit, which is normal for her. Additionally, she stated that she steered to the right to avoid a non-contact vehicle encroaching into her lane, but ultimately lost control of her vehicle and struck the guardrail and a tree. The driver's excessive speed and inadequate evasive action, along with poor directional control and overcompensation, were identified as driver-related factors contributing to the crash. Furthermore, the driver's lack of experience was considered an associated factor. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and lack of control.
