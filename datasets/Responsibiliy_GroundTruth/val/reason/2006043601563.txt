The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 admitted to not properly checking for traffic before entering the intersection. Despite claiming that the sunset obscured her view, the researcher determined that the bright sunlight was not the critical cause of the crash. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 16 kmph, indicating that the driver did not have enough time to react and avoid the collision. V2, on the other hand, had the right of way as indicated by the stop sign for V1's direction. The driver of V2 assumed that V1 would stop, which was a false assumption. However, V2's assumption does not absolve V1 of responsibility for not adequately surveilling the intersection before proceeding. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
