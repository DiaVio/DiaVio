The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by dialing his cell phone and failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red. This distraction caused V1 to enter the intersection when it was not safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1994 Chevrolet G-series van). Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was fatigued and had only had four hours of sleep, which could have impaired the driver's ability to react appropriately to the changing traffic conditions. On the other hand, V2's driver was also distracted by talking on his cell phone, but it is stated that he did not see V1 prior to the impact and therefore had no time to attempt any avoidance actions. This suggests that V2's driver may have had less opportunity to prevent the collision. Overall, V1's failure to stop at the red light due to distraction and fatigue makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
