The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle # 2 was coded as "other Vehicle in Lane, other vehicle stopped," and the critical reason for the event was coded as a "vehicle related factor, braking system deficiency." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle # 2 failed to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle # 1, which was stopped for traffic. Additionally, the associated factors of rush hour congestion and sun glare may have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time.
