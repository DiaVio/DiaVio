The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn. Even though the left turn arrow had turned green, the driver of V1 did not adequately surveil the intersection and failed to look far enough ahead to ensure that her path was clear. This resulted in V1 crossing into the path of V2 (the 2005 Jeep Wrangler) and causing the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was cited for driving with a suspended license, which further indicates a lack of responsibility and adherence to traffic laws. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance.
