The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the Ford F250 pickup) was traveling straight on the eastbound lane and had the right of way. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 and proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the statement given by the driver of V1 to the police supports the fact that she thought she had enough room to make the turn, indicating a misjudgment on her part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure to yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
