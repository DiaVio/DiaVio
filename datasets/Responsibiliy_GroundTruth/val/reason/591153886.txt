The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to avoid colliding with the vehicle in front of them. This is evident from the fact that the driver had to brake and steer to the left, ultimately resulting in the vehicle traveling off the left side of the roadway and into the median. The driver's failure to react in time and maintain control of the vehicle led to the subsequent overturning and serious injuries.
