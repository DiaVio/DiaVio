The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 relinquished control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, causing it to drift off the road, sideswipe a guardrail, and ultimately collide with a utility pole. This loss of control and subsequent actions by the driver led to the accident.
