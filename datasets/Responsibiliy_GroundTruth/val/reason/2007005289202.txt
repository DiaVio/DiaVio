The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a right turn. The driver claimed to have looked left but did not notice any approaching vehicles. However, V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Intrigue) was heading east on the roadway in lane one, intending to continue straight. V1 pulled into the intersection directly in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the accident.
