The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the entrance ramp. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and critical reason codes provided. Additionally, the driver's inexperience with driving a manual transmission vehicle may have contributed to the loss of vehicle control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed and lack of experience in handling the vehicle.
