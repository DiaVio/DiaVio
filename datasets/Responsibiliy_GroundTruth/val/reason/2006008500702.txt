The reason for this is that V1 crossed from the second lane to the first lane and then continued off the roadway to the right, ultimately colliding with the rear of the disabled vehicle (V2). The driver of V1 claimed that a phantom vehicle caused her to swerve, but there is no evidence to support this claim. Additionally, the driver's high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.189 indicates impaired driving, which likely contributed to the poor directional control and the subsequent collision.
