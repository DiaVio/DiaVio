The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, an 80-year-old male, was unconscious minutes before the crash occurred. This critical non-performance error of being unable to act led to V1 departing the right side of the travel lane, striking the right curb, and ultimately colliding with a utility pole. The driver's unconsciousness indicates a lack of control over the vehicle, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
