The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 ran into the rear end of Vehicle #2 (2000 Audi A4), which then pushed Vehicle #2 into the back of Vehicle #3 (1993 Plymouth Voyager). This indicates that Vehicle #1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was observed to have an open fast food bag and a drink in the cup holder, suggesting that he was engaged in a non-driving activity of eating and drinking while driving. This non-driving activity likely contributed to the driver's inattention and recognition error, leading to the crash. Furthermore, the driver of Vehicle #1 was on several medications for a heart condition and diabetes, which may have impaired his ability to react quickly and appropriately to the traffic flow interruption caused by the debris in the roadway. Overall, the combination of the driver's inattention, non-driving activity, failure to maintain a safe following distance, and potential impairment from medications makes Vehicle #1 primarily responsible for the accident.
