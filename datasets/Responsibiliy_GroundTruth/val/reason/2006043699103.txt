The reason for this is that V2 made a false assumption of V1's actions. V1 slowed suddenly to turn right onto the side street, which V2 did not anticipate. Instead of maintaining a safe distance and being prepared for any sudden movements by V1, V2 steered right and braked abruptly to avoid a rear-end collision. This resulted in V2 losing control, going off the right side of the road, and ultimately colliding with the right side of V1. Therefore, V2's false assumption and failure to react appropriately to V1's actions led to the accident, making V2 primarily responsible.
