The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 disregarded the stop sign on the residential road and accelerated, turning left onto the arterial road. - V1 lost control and crossed the northbound travel lane, ultimately crashing into a privacy fence. - The driver of V1 was charged with driving on a suspended license. - The driver's aggressive driving behavior, due to fear of her husband who was in the bed of the truck, contributed to the crash. - The driver was also fatigued and inattentive, further impairing her ability to safely operate the vehicle. - V1 had low tread on the left rear tire, which could have affected its traction and control. Overall, V1's actions, including disregarding the stop sign, losing control, and the driver's aggressive and impaired driving behavior, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
