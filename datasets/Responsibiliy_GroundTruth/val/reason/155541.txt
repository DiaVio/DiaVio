The reason for this is that V2 struck the right-side of V1 in a T-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, but V2's impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and depart the road, resulting in more severe damage and injuries.
