The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which indicates that V1 had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V2, on the other hand, was traveling straight and had the right of way. V1's failure to yield and the fact that V1 fled the scene without exchanging information further supports their responsibility for the accident.
