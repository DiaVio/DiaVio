The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left turn at the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2, who was traveling straight through the intersection. This is evident from the statement of the driver of V2, who mentioned that V1 came to a stop at the intersection and then proceeded to make a left turn as V2 entered the intersection. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering right, but was unable to do so. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene of the crash and abandoned the vehicle, which further indicates their responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and fleeing the scene.
