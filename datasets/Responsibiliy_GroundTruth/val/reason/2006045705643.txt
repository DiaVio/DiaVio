The reason for this is that V2 hit V3 in the rear-end, causing V3 to then rear-end V1. V2's driver was coded as being fatigued and failing to look far enough ahead to see traffic stopping. Additionally, following too closely in heavy rush hour traffic was attributed to V2. The driver of V2 was also unfamiliar with the roadway. These factors indicate that V2's driver was not exercising proper caution and attention, leading to the collision.
