The reason for this is that V2 encroached over the left lane line, which caused the collision with V1. Additionally, V2's driver had been working on the brakes of the motorcycle immediately before the crash, which could have contributed to a braking system deficiency. These factors indicate that V2's actions and potential mechanical issues played a significant role in causing the accident.
