The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at pedestrians on the southwest corner of the intersection and failed to notice V2's brake lights in time to avoid the collision. This distraction caused her to rear-end V2, which then pushed V2 forward into V3. Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention to the road and react in a timely manner is the primary reason for the accident.
