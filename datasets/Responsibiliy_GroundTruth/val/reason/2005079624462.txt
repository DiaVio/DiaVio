The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted that his attention was diverted from the forward view to the rear-view mirror, where he was looking at the vehicle immediately behind him. This distraction caused him to not notice the stopped vehicles ahead in time to stop and avoid the collision. The critical reason for the event, as attributed to V1, is a driver-related factor of external distraction.
