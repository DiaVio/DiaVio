The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by arguing on the phone with her boyfriend, which caused her to not see V2 (the driver of the Saturn Vue) who was stopped at the red traffic signal. V1 then departed her lane and struck the back of V2's vehicle. Additionally, contributing factors to V1's responsibility include emotional factors (being upset with her boyfriend), inadequate surveillance (failing to look far enough ahead), and the driver's own admission of being fatigued and taking medication that may have caused side effects such as drowsiness. On the other hand, V2 was stopped at the red traffic signal and began to accelerate when the signal turned green. V2 was not at fault for the accident as she was following traffic rules and was not aware of V1's presence before the impact. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving and other contributing factors.
