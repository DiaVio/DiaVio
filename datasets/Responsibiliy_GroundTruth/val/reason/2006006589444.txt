The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that they failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection. This is evident from the fact that V1 was already in the intersection and V2 turned directly into its path, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," further supporting their responsibility for the accident.
