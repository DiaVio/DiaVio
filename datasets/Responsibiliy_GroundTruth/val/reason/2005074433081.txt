The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was distracted by helping the right front passenger adjust his seat, which caused her to lose focus on the driving task. This distraction led to a misjudgment of the proximity and velocity of the heavy truck (V1), resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being emotionally/mentally consumed by a previous argument with a relative and feeling fatigued, further contributing to her lack of attention on the road.
