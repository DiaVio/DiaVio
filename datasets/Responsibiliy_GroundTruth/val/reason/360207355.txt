The reason for this is that V1 drove off the roadway to the right, striking the curb and continuing onto a sidewalk and grassy area before ultimately impacting a brick/concrete base of a resident sign. This indicates that V1 was not properly maintaining its lane and veered off the road, resulting in the collision.
