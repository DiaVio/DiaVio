The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain proper direction control of the vehicle, resulting in overcompensation and ultimately losing control. This is evident from the driver's actions of steering right and then left to avoid the NCV, which led to V1 traveling off the roadway and colliding with the jersey barrier. The critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side further supports the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
