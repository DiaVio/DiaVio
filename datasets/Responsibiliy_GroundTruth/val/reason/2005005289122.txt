V1 admitted to driving through a red light just prior to the crash, indicating a violation of traffic laws. This action directly caused the collision with V2 (2000 Ford Focus), which had the right of way with a green light at the intersection. V1's failure to stop at the red light and yield to oncoming traffic is the main reason for the accident.
