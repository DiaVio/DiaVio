The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to daydreaming and not paying attention to the traffic ahead. When the driver realized that the traffic was stopping, instead of applying the brakes, he steered right and accelerated, causing V1 to travel off the right side of the roadway and collide with a building and a low concrete wall. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control (e.g. failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected)." This indicates that the driver's lack of attention and poor control of the vehicle were the main factors leading to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to control the vehicle properly.
