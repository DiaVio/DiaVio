The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to detect V2 (the 1994 Chevrolet C-1500 pickup) stopped in front of him, despite V2 being stationary for more than 10 seconds. This indicates that V1 was not paying attention and was daydreaming while driving, which is a driver-related factor and a form of inattention. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and react to the stopped vehicle in front of him makes him primarily responsible for the collision.
