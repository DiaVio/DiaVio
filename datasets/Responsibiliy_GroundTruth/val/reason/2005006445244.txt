The driver of vehicle one admitted to being in a hurry and thought that vehicle two was going to stop. This indicates a lack of caution and an aggressive driving behavior, which led to the collision. Additionally, vehicle one was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, the driver of vehicle two stated that he was traveling north on the roadway and had a green traffic light. This suggests that he had the right of way and was proceeding through the intersection legally. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of aggressive driving behavior and failure to yield, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash.
