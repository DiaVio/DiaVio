The reason for this is that V2 was parked in a parking stall in the parking lot where V1 (the 1999 Lincoln Town car) came to its final rest after losing control. V2 did not have any involvement in the initial incident where V1 lost control and departed the roadway. Therefore, V2 cannot be held responsible for the accident.
