The reason for this is that V1 was traveling southbound on the one-way roadway and failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection. V2 (the Lexus GS300) was traveling eastbound through the intersection and had the right of way since there was no traffic control device on their roadway. V1's failure to yield and stop at the stop sign resulted in the collision with V2. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by the parked minibus at the northwest corner of the intersection may have contributed to the accident for both drivers. However, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign is the primary reason for the collision.
