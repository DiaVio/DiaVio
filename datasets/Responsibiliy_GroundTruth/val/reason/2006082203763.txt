The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by turning left at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. The driver stated that his sight line was obstructed by in-transport vehicles, which prevented him from seeing V2 (the 2005 Toyota Scion XB) until the collision was imminent. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that it was safe to proceed with the left turn. While it is mentioned that V2 may have encroached over the left lane line, it is not clear if this was a contributing factor to the collision. Without further information, it cannot be determined if V2's actions were a result of not looking for turning vehicles or not paying attention to the road ahead. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1.
