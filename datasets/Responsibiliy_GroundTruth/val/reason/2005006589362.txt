The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that V2 failed to stop at the stop sign and crossed in front of V1, which had the right of way. Additionally, V2 was distracted by adjusting the radio while entering the intersection, which contributed to the driver's failure to notice the stop sign. The driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway and apprehension about entering the intersection also played a role in the accident.
