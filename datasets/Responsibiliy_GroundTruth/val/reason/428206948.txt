The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and impacted the left side of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2002 Chevrolet K2500 pickup, which was attempting to execute a left turn. V1's failure to yield the right of way to V2, who had the right of way while making a left turn, indicates that V1 was at fault for the collision.
