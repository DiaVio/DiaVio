The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is a violation of traffic laws. The driver of V1, who did not have a driver's license, claimed that the brakes failed, but this was not verified as the vehicle was towed without the brakes being checked. Additionally, the driver of V1 was uncooperative with the investigating officer and EMS. On the other hand, V2 (the 1997 Honda CR-V) stopped at the stop sign and waited for almost 10 seconds before making a left turn. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 approaching from the left but assumed it would stop for the stop sign. V2 did not try to avoid the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the illegal maneuver of failing to stop at the stop sign.
