The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being exhausted and distracted at the time of the accident. He stated that he hadn't slept well due to a cold and long working hours, and he was looking at a building on the left side of the road instead of paying attention to the vehicles in front of him. This distraction and fatigue likely contributed to his failure to notice V2 and V3 slowing down until the last minute, resulting in the collision. V2 and V3 were both traveling in front of V1 and decelerating due to traffic conditions, indicating that they were following the normal flow of traffic. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with higher speed," suggesting that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2. However, V2's higher speed alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility, as V1's distraction and failure to react appropriately were the primary factors leading to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash due to driver-related factors, including distraction and fatigue.
