The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to recognize that V2 was stopped ahead. The driver of V1 also exhibited driver-related factors such as inattention, inadequate surveillance, and a misjudgment of the speed of the forward vehicle. These factors suggest that V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and failed to react appropriately to the stopped vehicle ahead.
