The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right and struck an embankment, indicating that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's conflicting statements about the cause of the crash (initially claiming to have suffered a seizure and then claiming to have fallen asleep) suggest a lack of attentiveness or impairment while driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the uncertainty surrounding their condition at the time of the incident.
