The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention to the traffic and stated that she never saw V2 prior to the crash. This indicates a clear case of driver inattention and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was identified as inattention or daydreaming. On the other hand, the driver of V2 stated that he did not see V1 prior to the crash. While V2 was coded for other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction, the critical reason for this event was not specifically coded to V2. Therefore, V2's role in the accident seems to be more of a result of V1's actions rather than any fault on the part of V2. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and inadequate surveillance, which led to the collision with V2.
