The reason for this is that the case vehicle, a 2003 Kia Rio four-door sedan, was turning left at the intersection, which means it had the right of way. V2, traveling eastbound, struck the right fender of the case vehicle, indicating that V2 failed to yield to the turning vehicle. This failure to yield resulted in the collision and subsequent damage to both vehicles.
