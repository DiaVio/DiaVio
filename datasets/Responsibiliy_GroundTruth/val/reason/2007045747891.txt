The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention to the road and being distracted by adjusting the CD player and looking down at the speedometer. He also failed to look to either side ahead as he approached the intersection. Evidence at the scene, including the point of impact and the fact that two other eastbound vehicles passed through the intersection ahead of V2, suggests that V1 most likely had a red light and failed to stop for it. This indicates an illegal maneuver on the part of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of prescription medication to control diabetes, which may have impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. Work-related stress due to work hazards was also mentioned as a contributing factor. In contrast, the driver of V2 (the Cadillac Seville) reported that she had a green light and was accelerating as she approached the intersection. She stated that she did not see V1 and took no evasive actions before being struck. While she was unfamiliar with the roadway, this alone does not appear to be a significant contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to distracted driving, failure to stop for a red light, and potential impairment from medication and work-related stress.
