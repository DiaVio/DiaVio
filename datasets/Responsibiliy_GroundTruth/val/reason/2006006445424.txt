The reason for this is that V1 was traveling behind V2 (the 2006 Pontiac Vibe) and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a rear-end collision. V1 drove directly into the rear of V2 while V2 was stopped at a red light, indicating that V1 was not able to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, there were no associated factors coded to the driver of V1, suggesting that there were no external factors that contributed to the accident. V2, on the other hand, was stopped at a red light and was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and avoid a rear-end collision.
