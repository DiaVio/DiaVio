The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the center yellow lines and clipped the left front side of V2 (the 2002 Subaru Impreza sedan). This initial impact caused V2 to lose control and spin off the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. V1 then continued in the opposing lane and was headed directly at V3 (the 2006 BMW 3-series sedan), which had to veer to the right to avoid the crash and ended up striking a utility pole. Although V1 claimed that a cat darted out in front of her vehicle, causing her to swerve and clip V2, the investigation determined that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. The critical reason for V1 was incorrect evasive action. Additionally, factors such as fatigue, use of prescription medication to control asthma, unfamiliarity with the vehicle, and the wet roadway were associated with V1. Therefore, V1's actions and the associated factors make her primarily responsible for the crash.
