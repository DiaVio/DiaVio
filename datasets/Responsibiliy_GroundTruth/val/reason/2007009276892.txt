The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a sharp steering maneuver to the left, which caused the vehicle to skid off the left side of the roadway and collide with the guardrail. The driver stated that she made this maneuver to avoid a non-contact SUV encroaching into her lane from the right. However, this evasive action was deemed incorrect because it resulted in the loss of vehicle control. Additionally, the wet road conditions likely contributed to the driver's inability to regain control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and traveling too fast for the wet road conditions.
