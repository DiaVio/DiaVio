The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by talking on her handheld mobile phone, which was identified as an internal distraction. This distraction caused her to lose control of the vehicle and make a sharp steering maneuver, resulting in the vehicle skidding off the road, rolling over, and ultimately causing the crash. Additionally, it was mentioned that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions and did not realize that caution was required. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. Overall, the driver's distraction and failure to adapt to the traffic conditions make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
