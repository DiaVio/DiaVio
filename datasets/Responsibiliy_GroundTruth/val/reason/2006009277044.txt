The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a burst water pump, causing the windshield to cloud up and impairing their visibility. Despite this, the driver continued to travel on the roadway without attempting to pull over onto the shoulder. This decision error, combined with the driver's inexperience (having only been licensed for a year), led to the rear-end collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1987 Chevrolet Pick-up) is not considered to have contributed to the crash, as there are no associated factors coded to V2 and the driver stated that they saw V1 come up behind them and fail to stop before crashing into them.
