The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the 1999 Ford F350). V1 assumed that V2 would yield the right of way, even though V2 had already stopped at the intersection. This false assumption led V1 to start making a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with her son in the backseat and had limited experience driving on this particular roadway. These factors likely contributed to her failure to properly assess the situation and make a safe turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption, distraction, and inexperience.
