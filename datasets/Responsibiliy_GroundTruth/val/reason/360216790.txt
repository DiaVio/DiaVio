The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway and impacted concrete steps, resulting in the deployment of both frontal airbags. V1 then ramped up the steps, completed two quarter turns, and came to a final rest on its top on the sidewalk. This indicates that V1 was not under proper control and failed to stay on the roadway, leading to the accident.
