The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 experienced brake failure and failed to properly assess the situation before reentering the roadway. The driver did not look to see if there was traffic coming, which resulted in V2 (the 2002 Pontiac Gran Prix) colliding with the left rear quarter panel of V1. This indicates that V1's actions directly contributed to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a hearing impairment that could have prevented him from hearing the brake sensors, indicating it was time to replace the brakes. This further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that V2 also had a critical pre-crash event, which was "other vehicle encroachment from driveway, intended path not known." However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2's actions were not a significant contributing factor to the accident.
