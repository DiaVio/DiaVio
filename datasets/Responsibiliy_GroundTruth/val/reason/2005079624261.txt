The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. Despite seeing V2 approaching, V1 believed that there was enough distance to safely complete the turn. However, V2 was not able to stop in time and collided with the left side of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 may have been distracted internally by the passengers, particularly the children who were still buckling their seat belts. This internal distraction could have diverted her attention from properly assessing the oncoming traffic. Furthermore, sun glare was present for V1 as she traveled westbound, which could have affected her visibility and perception of the approaching vehicle. Overall, V1's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, internal distraction, and potential impact of sun glare contribute to her primary responsibility for the collision.
