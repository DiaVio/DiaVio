The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to slow down sufficiently and rear-ended V1. The driver of V2 was looking over his shoulder to see if it was clear to change lanes, and as a result, did not see that V1 had stopped in front of him. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V2. Additionally, the associated factors of following too closely and an exterior factor (the sudden stop of the non-contact vehicle) further contribute to the responsibility of V2 for the accident.
