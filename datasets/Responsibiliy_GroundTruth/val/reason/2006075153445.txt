The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, the driver's inexperience and unfamiliarity with the vehicle and the route were associated factors. V2 (the driver of the 1994 Toyota 4Runner) was traveling straight and was encroached upon by V1, who turned left in the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." However, the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V2 was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that V2 did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and inexperience.
