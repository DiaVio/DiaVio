The driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of other road users. He assumed that when he saw a green light, it was for a left turn arrow and that all oncoming traffic would yield the right of way to him because they would have a red light. However, the traffic signal was actually green for both north and southbound traffic. This false assumption led the driver of V1 to proceed with the left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only recently obtained his driver's license and may have lacked the necessary experience to accurately assess the situation and make the correct decision at the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's false assumption and lack of experience.
