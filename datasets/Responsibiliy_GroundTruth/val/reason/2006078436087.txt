The driver of V1 made a left turn in front of V2 (the driver of the Honda CRX) without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, causing V2 to collide with the right side of V1. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the gap or other's speed makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
