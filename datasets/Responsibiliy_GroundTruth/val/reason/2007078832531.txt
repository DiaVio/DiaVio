The driver of V1 made two U-turns, crossing the northbound lane onto the east shoulder and then re-entering the northbound roadway without adequately surveilling the area. This indicates a failure to exercise proper caution and awareness of other vehicles on the road. Additionally, the driver admitted to consuming alcohol before the crash, with a BAC test result of 0.151, which is above the legal limit. This impaired the driver's judgment and ability to safely operate the vehicle. V2 (the driver of the 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV) was traveling within the speed limit and had the right of way. The driver of V2 observed V1 crossing the road onto the east shoulder and almost stopping, but mistakenly believed that V1 would yield the right of way. V2 did not contribute to the critical events leading to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance, impaired driving, and failure to yield the right of way.
