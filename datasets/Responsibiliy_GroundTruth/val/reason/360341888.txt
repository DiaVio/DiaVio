The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in lane one on the intersecting street and impacted the left side of V1, the 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe compact utility vehicle, which was traveling west in lane one. V2 continued traveling forward after the initial impact, indicating that it failed to yield the right of way to V1.
