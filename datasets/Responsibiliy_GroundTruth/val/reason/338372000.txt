The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 traveled left over the center line into the direction of travel of Vehicle 2 (the 2011 Honda Civic). This resulted in a head-on collision between Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 2. Additionally, after the initial impact, Vehicle 1 continued in the oncoming lane and struck Vehicle 3 (the 2005 Dodge Neon) head-on. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 1, crossing over into the opposite lane of travel and causing two separate head-on collisions, indicate that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
