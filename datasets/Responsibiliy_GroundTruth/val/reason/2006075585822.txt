The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one misjudged the speed of vehicle two (2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse) and proceeded to make a left turn at the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This misjudgment of the other vehicle's speed led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of vehicle one was not wearing prescription lenses, despite being required to do so for an unknown vision impairment. This could have potentially affected the driver's ability to accurately assess the distance and speed of oncoming vehicles. Therefore, based on the driver's misjudgment and failure to take necessary precautions, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident.
