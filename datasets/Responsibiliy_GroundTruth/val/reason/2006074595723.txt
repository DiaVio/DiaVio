The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to notice V2 (the light tan 2002 Buick Lesabre sedan) in front of her, despite V2 having its brake lights on and right turn signal activated. V1's internal distraction, specifically looking at the clock on the dash and not paying attention to the road, caused her to be unaware of the proximity of V2 and ultimately resulted in the collision.
