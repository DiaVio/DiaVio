The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while driving on the icy road. Despite driving below the speed limit, the driver was still traveling too fast for the conditions, which resulted in the vehicle skidding off the roadway and colliding with the parked vehicle (V2). The driver's decision to let up on the brakes also contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust their driving behavior to the icy road conditions.
