The driver of Vehicle #1 misjudged the velocity of Vehicle #2 (the 1996 Ford Explorer) while attempting to cross the road from the private drive on the south side to the private drive on the north side. This misjudgment of the other vehicle's speed led to the collision. Vehicle #2 (the 1996 Ford Explorer) also had contributing factors to the crash, such as excess speed and a sight line restriction due to a pickup truck traveling in the left lane in front of it. However, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for misjudging the gap and causing the collision.
