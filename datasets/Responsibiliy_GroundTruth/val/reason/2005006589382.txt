The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1, a 17-year old male, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite stopping at the corner and looking both ways, the driver of V1 did not see Vehicle two (V2) approaching from the left. This inadequate surveillance led to V1's left side contacting the front of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
