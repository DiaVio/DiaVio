The driver of V1 fled the scene, which is an act of negligence and a violation of traffic laws. By fleeing the scene, the driver of V1 failed to fulfill their legal obligations and did not provide any information or assistance to the other party involved in the accident. Additionally, the driver of V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Blazer) stated that he saw V1 approaching the intersection but assumed that V1 would yield the right-of-way. While this assumption may have contributed to the accident, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for fleeing the scene and not taking proper precautions while turning left at the intersection. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their act of fleeing the scene, while V2 may have made a false assumption about V1's actions.
