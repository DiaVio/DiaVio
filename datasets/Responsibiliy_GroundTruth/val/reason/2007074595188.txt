The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 had a seizure just before the crash, which impaired his ability to act and caused him to strike the back of V2. This initial impact set off a chain reaction, causing V1 to continue striking the back of V3, V4, and V5. Therefore, V1's driver's physical impairment due to a seizure is the critical reason for the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
