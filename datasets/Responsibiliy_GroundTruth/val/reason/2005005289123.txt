The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her and did not react in time to avoid the collision with V2. The driver of V1 stated that there was another car directly in front of her and that car went around V2, which was waiting to make a left turn. However, instead of maintaining a safe distance and being prepared to stop, the driver of V1 continued to follow closely behind the car in front and only hit the brakes when she realized the impending danger. This recognition error and failure to maintain a safe distance contributed to the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1's speed was estimated to be between 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph) suggests that she may have been traveling too fast for the conditions, considering the slight rain and the need to be prepared for unexpected stops. Overall, V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and react in a timely manner to the situation ahead makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
