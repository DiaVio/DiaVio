The driver of V1 admitted to traveling between 82-96kmph (51-60mph) on slick snow-covered roads, which indicates that she was driving too fast for the conditions. This decision error of traveling too fast for the poor weather conditions led to the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent crash into a breakaway signpost. Additionally, the driver of V1 left the scene of the crash and went to work without reporting it, which is a violation of the law and shows a lack of responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to travel too fast for the conditions and leaving the scene without reporting the accident.
