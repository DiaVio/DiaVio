The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was a decision error. The driver admitted to going approximately 60 mph, which is 10 miles over the posted speed limit, while negotiating a leftward curve on a wet roadway. This excessive speed, combined with the wet conditions, caused V1 to lose control and hydroplane, resulting in the initial impact with Vehicle 2 (V2). Additionally, V1's driver stated that she did not realize she was following too closely and was talking to passengers, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving. These factors contribute to V1's responsibility for the crash.
