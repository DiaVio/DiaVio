The reason for this is that V1's driver drove over the curb on the west side of the street, struck a pole, and then backed away from the pole, crossing both lanes of the roadway and crashing into a closed garage door on the east side. This indicates a loss of control and failure to maintain proper lane position by the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver's potential falling asleep at the wheel and high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .320 further contribute to their responsibility for the crash.
