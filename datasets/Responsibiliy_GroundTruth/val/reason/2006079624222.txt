The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the traffic signal and made an illegal maneuver by encroaching into the left lane of the opposite direction. Additionally, the driver of V2 was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.164, well above the legal limit. These factors indicate that V2 was not following traffic laws and was impaired at the time of the collision.
