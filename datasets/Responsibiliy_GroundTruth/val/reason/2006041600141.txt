The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that cut the corner short and sideswiped a utility pole. V1 then continued out of control and struck a large tree. The witness at the scene confirmed that V1 attempted a right turn, hit a telephone pole, and then drove off the roadway to make contact with the tree. The physical evidence on the scene also supports the witness's statement. Additionally, the driver of V1 appeared to be inebriated, with slurred speech and difficulty standing on her own. The presence of alcohol was evident, and it was coded as an associated factor in the crash.
