The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve on the exit ramp, as indicated by the Critical Pre-crash Event being "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions" and the Critical Reason being coded as "too fast for curve". Additionally, the driver's fatigue, tire deficiency (screw in tire), insufficient braking inputs, and steering with only one hand when the vehicle did not respond all contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle and avoid the crash.
