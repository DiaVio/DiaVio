The reason for V1's responsibility is that it struck the back of V2 (the 2000 Sterling A9500 M/H truck) while V2 was stopped at the intersection with a red traffic control signal. V2 was following the rules of the road by decelerating and coming to a complete stop at the signal. V1, on the other hand, failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the back of V2. Additionally, the lack of interview with the driver of V1 prevents us from determining any potential factors that may have contributed to the accident. However, regardless of the circumstances, V1 is responsible for the collision as it was the striking vehicle.
