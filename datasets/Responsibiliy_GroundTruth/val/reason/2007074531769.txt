The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating a lack of control. - The critical reason for this pre-crash event was determined to be the driver-related factor of driving too fast for the curve/turn. - The driver of V1 was a sixteen-year-old male with only six months of driving experience, indicating a lack of skill and experience in handling the vehicle. - Additionally, the driver mentioned that he was not comfortable with the vehicle due to mismatched tires/wheels, which could have further compromised the vehicle's handling and control. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
