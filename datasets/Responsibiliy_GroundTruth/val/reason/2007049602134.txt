The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that they let several cars cross in front of them before starting their left turn, but they did not look to their right again before proceeding. This indicates a lack of proper surveillance and failure to see the approaching V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way to V2 resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
