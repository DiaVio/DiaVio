The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to see the approaching vehicle (V1) due to traffic obstruction. V2 was turning left in front of stopped traffic and did not adequately assess the situation before proceeding. This failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V1. Additionally, V2's acceleration in an attempt to avoid the collision led to the loss of control and the vehicle ending up in a ditch.
