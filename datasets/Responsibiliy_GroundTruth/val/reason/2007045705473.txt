The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included rain, a wet road, and darkness. This is evident from the driver's statement that she hit some water and began to spin out while steering left and braking. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was the vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions. Other contributing factors include the driver's fatigue, as she had been on the road for almost four hours and had been up the whole day leading up to the crash. The driver's untreated mild form of diabetes may have also contributed to her feeling shaky and potentially impacting her ability to control the vehicle. Furthermore, tire deficiency was coded based on low tread depth measurements on the rear tires of V1, which could have affected the vehicle's traction on the wet road. The presence of a small dog riding in the right front position may have also been a distraction for the driver. Overall, V1's primary responsibility for the crash can be attributed to the driver's excessive speed for the prevailing conditions, combined with factors such as fatigue, untreated diabetes, tire deficiency, and potential distractions.
