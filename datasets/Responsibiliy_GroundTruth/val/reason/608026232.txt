The reason for holding the driver primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle after the right wheels dropped off the roadway. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control and stay within the designated lane. Additionally, the driver's attempt to return the wheels to the roadway resulted in a counterclockwise yaw and subsequent rollover, suggesting a lack of proper corrective action. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver and the right-rear passenger were unrestrained, which is a violation of safety regulations. This lack of restraint likely contributed to the severity of their injuries. Therefore, based on the information provided, the driver of the case vehicle is primarily responsible for the accident.
