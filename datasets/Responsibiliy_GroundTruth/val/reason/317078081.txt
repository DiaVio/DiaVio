The reason for this is that V1 was traveling on a two-lane two-way roadway and was required to stop at a controlled intersection. V2 (the 2008 Honda Accord) was traveling on a three-lane one-way roadway, which means it had the right of way and did not have any traffic control devices to obey. V1 attempted to pass through the intersection without yielding to the oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way and violated the traffic rules, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
