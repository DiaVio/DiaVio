The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, specifically trying to get around slower vehicles and becoming upset when they would not let him pass. This aggressive behavior likely led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and driving off the right side of the road. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a speed of 89 kmph (55 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). These factors indicate that the driver's actions and behavior were the main cause of the crash.
