The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was changing lanes from lane two to lane three without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This action caused V1 to cross into the path of V2 (the 2006 Mack CV7 dump truck), resulting in the collision. V1's misjudgment of the gap or speed of V2 led to the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to rarely driving on this road, which may have contributed to his misjudgment and lack of familiarity with the traffic patterns. The driver's inattentiveness and possible health conditions, such as high blood pressure and sleep apnea, could have also affected his ability to safely change lanes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly change lanes and yield to oncoming traffic.
