The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes from lane three to lane one without maintaining proper control of their vehicle. They braked with lock-up, causing their vehicle to skid and collide with the back of V2 (the 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser) which was stopped behind V3 (the 2007 Honda Pilot). This initial impact then pushed V2 forward, causing it to collide with the rear of V3. V1's actions of changing lanes without proper control and failing to stop in time to avoid a collision indicate that they were not driving in a safe manner for the congested traffic conditions. Additionally, the associated factors coded to V1, such as inadequate surveillance and traveling too fast for conditions, further support their primary responsibility for the crash.
