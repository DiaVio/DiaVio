V1 failed to slow down for traffic and impacted the rear of V3, which was stopped ahead of it. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and did not exercise adequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that the vehicle in front of her suddenly appeared, possibly from a parking lot, but this does not absolve her from the responsibility of maintaining a safe distance and being aware of the traffic conditions ahead. Rush hour traffic was also identified as an associated factor, suggesting that V1 may have been following too closely to keep up with the flow of traffic.
