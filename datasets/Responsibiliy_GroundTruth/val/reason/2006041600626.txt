The driver of V1 was attempting to change lanes into the HOV lane (lane five) to respond to a disabled vehicle on the left side paved emergency shoulder. However, he failed to notice V2, the Mitsubishi Eclipse, traveling in lane five at the speed limit. As a result, V1 sideswiped V2, causing V2 to lose control and collide with the concrete median wall. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 was not properly maintaining his lane position. The critical pre-crash reason for V1 was an external distraction, as he was looking for the location of the disabled vehicle, which distracted him from noticing V2 in his path. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to his improper lane change and failure to notice the presence of V2 in the HOV lane.
