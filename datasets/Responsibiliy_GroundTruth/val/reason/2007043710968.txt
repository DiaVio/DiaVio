The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive action by steering right when braking alone would have been sufficient. This driver error led to V1 departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a utility pole. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, seasonal allergies, and possible distraction from listening to the radio may have contributed to the incorrect evasive action taken.
