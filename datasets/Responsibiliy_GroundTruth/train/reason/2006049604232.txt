The reason for this is that V2 cut into V1's lane of travel, crossing from lane two into lane three in front of V1. This unexpected action by V2 forced V1 to take evasive action by steering to the left, causing V1 to depart the roadway and collide with the concrete median. V1's driver tried to avoid the collision, but the sudden lane change by V2 made it difficult for V1 to respond in time. Therefore, V2's actions of cutting into V1's lane can be considered the primary cause of the crash.
