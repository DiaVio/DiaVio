The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2, the 1998 International truck). This resulted in V1's front contacting the rear of V2, causing the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to have been feeling unwell and may have blacked out before the crash. The driver's brother stated that she had mentioned the last thing she remembered was the truck being several hundred feet ahead of her vehicle. This suggests a possible loss of consciousness or impaired awareness, which would further support V1's responsibility for the crash. It is important to note that V2 (the 1998 International truck) was not found to have any contributing factors or errors that led to the crash. The driver of V2 was traveling at a reasonable speed and had checked his mirrors and lanes before the crash occurred. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's high speed, failure to maintain a safe distance, and potential loss of consciousness or impaired awareness. V2 does not bear any responsibility based on the information provided.
