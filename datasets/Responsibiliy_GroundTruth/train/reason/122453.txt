The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 drifted off the left side of the road, lost control while attempting to re-enter the travel lane, and ultimately collided with the embankment. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane, resulting in the accident.
