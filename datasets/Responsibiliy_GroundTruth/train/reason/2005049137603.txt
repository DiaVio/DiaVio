The driver of V1 did not stop for the traffic signal and entered the intersection, which is considered an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by conversing with a passenger, which may have contributed to her failure to see V2 (the 1996 Ford Ranger pick-up) until after the impact.
