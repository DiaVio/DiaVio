The driver of V1 attempted to change lanes without adequately checking for other vehicles in the adjacent lane. This is evident from the fact that V1 was coded with a critical reason of "inadequate surveillance" and the driver admitted to not turning his head to check lane three before moving to the left. This lack of proper observation and failure to ensure the lane was clear before changing lanes led to the collision with V2 (the Kia Optima).
