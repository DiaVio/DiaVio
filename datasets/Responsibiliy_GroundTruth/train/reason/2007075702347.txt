The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 105 kmph (65 mph) on a roadway with icy conditions. This indicates that the driver was driving too fast for the conditions, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, with only three months of driving experience, and the fact that she attempted to correct the vehicle's rotation by steering right and then left, resulting in overcompensation, were also contributing factors to the crash.
