The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right-of-way to V1, which was approaching from the opposite direction. The driver of V2 was found to be daydreaming and not paying attention, which was identified as a critical reason for the accident. Additionally, V1's assumption that V2 would wait until the intersection was clear before turning was an associated factor in the crash, but the primary responsibility lies with V2 for not yielding the right-of-way.
