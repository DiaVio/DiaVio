The driver of V2 admitted to being distracted by talking on the CB radio and reading directions just before the near impact. This distraction likely caused him to cross the center line into V1's lane, forcing V1 to take evasive action to avoid a head-on collision. Although V1 (the Honda Accord) was also traveling at the posted speed limit and negotiating a left curve, the driver's decision to steer right and brake to avoid the oncoming truck was a reasonable and appropriate evasive action given the circumstances. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the crash lies with the driver of V2 due to their distraction and failure to maintain their lane.
