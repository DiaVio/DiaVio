The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to hitting the accelerator instead of the brake. This resulted in V1 reversing and colliding with multiple objects, including traffic signals, a picnic table, and ultimately crashing into a restaurant. The driver's admission of his reaction time not being what he thought it should be further supports the conclusion that the driver was not able to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
