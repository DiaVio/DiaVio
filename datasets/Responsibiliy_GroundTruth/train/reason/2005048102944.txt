The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control exhibited by the driver. The driver initially veered off the right road edge, then overcorrected by steering left and subsequently departed the left side of the traffic lane. This erratic steering and inability to maintain control of the vehicle led to the clockwise rotation, tripping of the tires, and ultimately the rollover onto the driver's side. The driver's poor directional control and inability to stay within the traffic lane contributed to the crash.
