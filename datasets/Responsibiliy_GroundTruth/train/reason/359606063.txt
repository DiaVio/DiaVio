The reason for this is that V2 was traveling eastbound and failed to avoid striking Vehicle 3 (V3), the 1999 Chrysler Town and Country, which was decelerating and preparing to make a left turn. V2's front right impacted the back left of V3, resulting in minor damage to both vehicles. V2 then continued east and crossed over the center lane line, entering the westbound lane where Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan, was traveling. V1 attempted to steer to the right to avoid the collision, but the front of V1 impacted the front of V2, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise and depart the north side of the highway. Therefore, V2's failure to avoid striking V3 and subsequently colliding with V1 makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
