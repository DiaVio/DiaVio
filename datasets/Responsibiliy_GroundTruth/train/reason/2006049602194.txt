The driver of V1 was attempting to make a left turn into the northbound lanes of traffic but was traveling at a higher rate of speed than necessary for the turn. This is evident from the physical evidence at the scene, such as the extent of crush and the fact that V1 partially departed the roadway to the right before impacting a utility pole. Additionally, the driver's statement that the right front tire blew up during the turn does not explain or justify the excessive speed. Therefore, V1's driver-related factor of being too fast for the curve/turn is the reason for their primary responsibility in the accident.
