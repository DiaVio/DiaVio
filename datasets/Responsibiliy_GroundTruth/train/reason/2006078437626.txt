The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that they looked left, right, and left again, but still failed to notice Vehicle two (V2) approaching from their right. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the V1 driver, leading to the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: crossing over [passing through] intersection" and the critical reason for this event was attributed to the driver-related factor of "inadequate surveillance." This further supports the conclusion that V1's failure to properly observe the intersection was the main cause of the crash. It is important to note that there is no known sleep or work information on the driver of V2, and they were not interviewed. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be determined if V2 bears any responsibility for the crash.
