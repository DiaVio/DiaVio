The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "Other Vehicle Encroachment: from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, resulting in the impact with V1. Since V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, it can be assumed that V1 had the right of way, and V2 failed to yield or maintain their lane, causing the collision. However, it should be noted that the driver of V1's pre-crash factors are unknown, as they were unable to be reached for an interview. Without this information, it is difficult to determine if there were any contributing factors from V1's side.
