The reason for Vehicle #1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to an internal distraction. The driver was reaching down to retrieve coins from the front right floorboard, which caused him to lose control and depart from the road. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced and rarely drove on that particular road, indicating a lack of familiarity with the road's conditions and potential hazards. The driver's estimated speed of 45 mph (72 kmph) also suggests that he was traveling too fast for the conditions, as the posted speed limit was 30 mph (48 kmph). Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's internal distraction, inexperience, excessive speed, and lack of familiarity with the road.
