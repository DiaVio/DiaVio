The reason for this is that V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. Additionally, V2's inadequate surveillance was an associated factor in the crash, suggesting that she did not properly observe the intersection before proceeding. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance make her primarily responsible for the accident.
