The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to daydreaming and not paying attention to his driving, which led to his vehicle going off the roadway. When he attempted to correct this by turning the wheel, the vehicle continued straight across the roadway, ultimately colliding with a guardrail. This indicates a recognition error and inattention on the part of the driver, which was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was not wearing his seatbelt, which could have contributed to the severity of his injuries. However, it is important to note that the police did not consider alcohol or illegal drugs to be a factor and did not order any testing of the driver.
