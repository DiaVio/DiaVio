The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing any approaching traffic before making the left turn. This indicates a driver-related error of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the rush hour traffic was coded as an associated factor, suggesting that the heavy traffic flow may have contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the situation before turning. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was unable to be interviewed and there is no information suggesting any critical reason or associated factors that would attribute responsibility to V2. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the traffic conditions before making the left turn.
