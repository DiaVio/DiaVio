The reason for VI's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by focusing on the vehicle stopped at the stop sign from the east roadway. This distraction caused VI to proceed with the left turn without checking for oncoming traffic again. VI failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), which was traveling straight through the intersection. VI's inexperience, lack of attention to oncoming traffic, and inadequate tire conditions also contributed to the accident.
