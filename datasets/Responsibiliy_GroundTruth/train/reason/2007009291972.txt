The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while driving, which is a critical non-performance error. This resulted in V1 drifting off the road to the right and hitting the guardrail. The driver's attempt to correct the direction of the vehicle by steering left and braking led to oversteering, causing V1 to veer across all three lanes and crash into the guardrail on the left side of the road. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was not wearing his lap belt, which could have contributed to the severity of his injuries when he was thrown head-first into the windshield. Overall, the driver's fatigue and falling asleep while driving, combined with the failure to wear a lap belt, are the primary reasons for V1's responsibility in the crash.
