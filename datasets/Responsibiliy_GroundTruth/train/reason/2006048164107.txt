The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while negotiating the curve, causing the vehicle to veer off the road. This driver-related factor of critical non-performance error, specifically sleeping, was the critical pre-crash event. Additionally, the driver's fatigue, combination of drugs (Adderal, Xanax, and Lortab), and overcompensation while trying to steer back onto the road contributed to the accident. The lack of a rumble strip in the immediate vicinity of the intersection and the drop-off between the improved asphalt shoulder and the sod roadside were contributing factors, but the primary responsibility lies with the driver's actions.
