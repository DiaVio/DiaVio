The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn on a blinking yellow light, assuming that V2 (the driver of the Toyota Highlander) would slow down or stop for the yellow light. However, V1 misjudged V2's speed and intentions, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's false assumption that all lights were turning yellow further contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of V2's actions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
