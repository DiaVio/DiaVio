The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. This decision error led to the loss of control of the vehicle and ultimately resulted in the accident. The driver's statement that she started to lose control at the top of the hill suggests that she was not adequately prepared for the road conditions and did not adjust her speed accordingly. Additionally, the driver's reported speed range of 34-48kmph (21-30mph) indicates that she was traveling at a relatively high speed for icy gravel roads. This further supports the conclusion that she was driving too fast for the conditions. While there are some associated factors such as deteriorated road edges that may have contributed to the accident, the primary responsibility lies with V1 and its driver for not adjusting their speed appropriately for the icy road conditions.
