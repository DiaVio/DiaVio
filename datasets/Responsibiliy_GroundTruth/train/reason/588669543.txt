The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control and departed its travel lane to the left. The driver attempted to correct the steering by initiating a right maneuver but oversteered, causing the vehicle to slide back across the roadway and ultimately collide with a tree on its left side. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
