The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at a red light, resulting in the collision with V2 (the driver of the Chrysler 300 sedan) who had the right of way and was making a left turn with a green light. V1's failure to stop at the traffic signal indicates a violation of traffic laws and a disregard for the safety of other road users.
