The driver of V1 stated that a deer ran out into the roadway from his right, causing him to swerve right and then veer left, ultimately resulting in the crash. However, several factors contribute to V1's responsibility: 1. Alcohol intoxication: Medical records indicated that the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .21, which is significantly above the legal limit. This suggests that the driver was impaired at the time of the crash, which likely affected his ability to react appropriately to the deer in the roadway. 2. Inadequate evasive action: The police report mentioned that there was no evidence of heavy braking on the part of the driver. This lack of braking, combined with over-steering, suggests that the driver did not take adequate evasive action to avoid the crash. This could be attributed to the driver's impaired judgment and coordination due to alcohol intoxication. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's alcohol intoxication and inadequate evasive action.
