The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in V1 rotating counterclockwise and moving into the travel path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2008 Chevrolet Silverado large pickup. The impact occurred when the front of V2 collided with the left side of V1. This indicates that V1's loss of control and subsequent movement into the path of V2 initiated the crash.
