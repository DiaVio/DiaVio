The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to avoid traffic in front. This resulted in V1 traveling off the right edge of the roadway, rolling over, and ultimately coming to rest on its roof. The wet road conditions and rain may have contributed to the driver's loss of control, but ultimately it was the driver's actions that led to the accident.
