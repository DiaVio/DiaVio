The reason for this is that V1 turned left without slowing or stopping, failing to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the red Chevrolet Cavalier) who was going straight. V2 had the right of way as they were traveling in the first lane and V1 should have waited for a safe opportunity to turn left. Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to be inattentive, which was identified as the critical reason for the accident. The driver's lack of understanding of the rules of the road, signs of fatigue, and consumption of alcohol further contribute to their responsibility for the accident.
