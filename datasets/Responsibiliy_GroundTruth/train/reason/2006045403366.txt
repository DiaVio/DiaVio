The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. Evidence at the scene indicates that V1 was about to enter a curve to the right, but the driver failed to realize this and drifted off the roadway. This suggests that the driver was not paying attention and was inexperienced, as he had only been driving for six months. These factors, combined with the driver's statement that he felt the right side tires go off the road and his attempt to steer to the left instead of applying the brakes, further support the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the crash.
