The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 (the driver of the 1994 Pontiac Grand Am) had stopped in lane two to make a left turn. V1's driver admitted to not realizing that the car ahead was stopped until it was too late to stop. This indicates a driver-related error of inattention on the part of V1's driver. Additionally, V1's driver mentioned that her brakes felt stiff, which suggests a possible issue with the vehicle's braking system. However, it is still the responsibility of the driver to maintain a safe distance and be attentive to the traffic ahead, regardless of any potential vehicle issues. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and failure to notice the stopped vehicle ahead.
