The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling off the road edge and entered the center median area, ultimately colliding with the end section of a W-beam guardrail. The sustained contact with the guardrail caused damage to the vehicle's front end structure, and a section of the guardrail detached and struck the vehicle's right front side surface. This event resulted in additional damage and the guardrail segment penetrated the interior passenger compartment, severely injuring the front right passenger. Therefore, Vehicle 1's actions of leaving the road and colliding with the guardrail directly led to the injuries sustained by the front right passenger, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
