The driver of V1 was traveling above the posted speed limit and failed to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of him. When the car in front of him slowed down to turn right, V1's driver applied the brakes, locking the left front tire. This caused V1 to skid across the double yellow line and collide with V2 (the 2003 Toyota Avalon) head-on. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported that his vehicle started to pull to the left due to a brake malfunction. However, the investigation found that the critical reason for the accident was the driver of V1 being too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others, indicating a decision error. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to speeding, failure to maintain a safe distance, and a decision error in not being able to respond to the car in front of him slowing down to turn.
