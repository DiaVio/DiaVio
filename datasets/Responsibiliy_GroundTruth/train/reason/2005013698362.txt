The driver of V1 admitted to running a red light, indicating a decision error and an illegal maneuver. This decision to run the red light directly led to the collision with V2 (the Buick Park Avenue). While V2's driver stated that she did not see V1 until it was too late and attempted to steer to the right, the primary cause of the accident was V1's illegal maneuver of running the red light.
