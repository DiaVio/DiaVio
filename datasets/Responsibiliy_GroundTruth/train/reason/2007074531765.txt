The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 did not see V1 approaching and therefore did not yield the right of way, resulting in the collision.
