The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to notice V2 (the 1993 Dodge Caravan) and began the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. The driver of V2 applied the brakes and steered right in an attempt to avoid the collision, indicating that they were taking appropriate action to prevent the accident. However, the right side of V1 was still struck by the front of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 claimed that they were not able to see around the non-contact truck that was turning left. While this may have obstructed their view, it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure it is safe to proceed with a left turn. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and ensure it was safe to make the left turn.
