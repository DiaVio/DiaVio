The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 78-year-old male, suffered a diabetic episode, which was identified as a driver-related factor. This physical impairment, likely a result of the diabetic episode, impaired the driver's ability to act and control the vehicle properly, leading to the erratic driving behavior observed by the witness and ultimately causing V1 to swerve, strike a light pole, and roll over.
