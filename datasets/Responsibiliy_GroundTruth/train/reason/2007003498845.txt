The witness, who was traveling southbound and had stopped for the red light, reported that V1 ran the red light and was traveling too fast to have been able to stop. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic control device and was traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Honda CR-V) reported that she was traveling through the intersection with a green light. Although there is no interview obtained from V2, the lack of evidence suggesting any wrongdoing on her part indicates that she was likely following the traffic rules. Therefore, based on the witness statement and the fact that V1 failed to stop for the red light and was traveling too fast, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
