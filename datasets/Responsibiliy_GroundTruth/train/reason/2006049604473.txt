This impairment likely caused her to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in multiple instances of departing the roadway and ultimately crashing into a concrete pillar. Additionally, the driver tested positive for PCP, indicating the presence of drugs in her system, which may have further impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely.
