The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a decision error by falsely assuming that V2 (the driver of the 2003 BMW X5) would turn left at the intersection and yield the right of way. V1 proceeded halfway across the intersection and stopped in the middle, waiting for traffic to clear. However, V2 continued straight through the intersection, resulting in the collision. V1's false assumption and misjudgment of V2's actions led to her starting her avoidance maneuvers and accelerating just as V2 was approaching, causing the collision. Therefore, V1's decision error and false assumption of V2's actions make her primarily responsible for the accident.
