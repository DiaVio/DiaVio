The driver of V1 failed to stop at the intersection and swerved left to avoid a phantom vehicle, causing V1 to collide with V2 (the Nissan Altima) and subsequently pushing V2 into V3 (the Dodge Ram). The driver of V1 admitted to not stopping at the intersection and stated that the vehicle started to slide when he applied the brakes on the wet road. Additionally, the investigation revealed that the tires on V1 were severely degraded, compromising the driver's ability to control the vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the intersection, swerving to avoid a phantom vehicle, and the compromised control of the vehicle due to degraded tires make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
