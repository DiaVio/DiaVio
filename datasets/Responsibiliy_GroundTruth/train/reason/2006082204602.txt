The reason for this is that V1 had a stop sign at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1998 Ford Windstar minivan). V1 made a decision to turn left from the stop sign without having a clear view of oncoming traffic due to the obstructed view caused by the transit bus. This decision error led to V1 pulling out into the intersection and colliding with V2, who was unable to take any avoidance actions due to the sudden appearance of V1. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision because they failed to yield the right of way and made a decision to turn with an obstructed view caused by the transit bus.
