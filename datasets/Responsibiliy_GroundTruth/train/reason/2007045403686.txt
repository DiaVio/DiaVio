The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it ran a red light while V2 had a green light. Despite having its emergency lights on, V1 failed to ensure that other drivers had seen it and that it could safely clear the intersection. The driver of V1 falsely assumed that other drivers would yield the right of way to him because of the emergency lights. This false assumption, along with other factors such as listening to the police radio and being in a hurry, led to V1 running the red light and causing the collision with V2.
