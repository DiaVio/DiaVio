The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver exhibited poor directional control, failing to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. The driver's correction of steering right with full brake application for the initial trailer swing caused the trailer to swing in the opposite direction, ultimately leading to the power unit overturning and the trailer rolling over. This indicates a lack of proper handling and control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash.
