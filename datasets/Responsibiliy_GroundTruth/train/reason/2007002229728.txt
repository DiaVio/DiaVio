The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was traveling north and collided with the left rear of Vehicle #1 (Chrysler Cirrus) while it was making a left turn at the intersection. Vehicle #2 stated that they observed Vehicle #1 at the intersection stop sign and assumed they would yield the right of way. However, it is the responsibility of the driver making a left turn to yield to oncoming traffic, regardless of whether they have a stop sign or not. Therefore, Vehicle #2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #1, resulting in the collision.
