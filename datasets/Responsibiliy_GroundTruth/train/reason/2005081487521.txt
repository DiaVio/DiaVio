The reason for this is that V1 veered right to avoid colliding with the stopped traffic in the fourth lane and entered the third lane, where it impacted the back of V2 (the 1978 Chevrolet half-ton pickup). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and did not exercise proper caution when changing lanes, resulting in the collision.
