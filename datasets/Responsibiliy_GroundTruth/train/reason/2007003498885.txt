The driver of V1 reported that a non-contact vehicle cut him off, causing him to lose control and impact the guardrail. However, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was "This vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "incorrect evasive action."
