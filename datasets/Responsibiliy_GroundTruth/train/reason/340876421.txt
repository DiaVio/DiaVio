The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that it struck the left side of the case vehicle (the Subaru Legacy) on the left doors and fender, engaging both the A- and B-pillar. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to the case vehicle, which was already in the intersection. The impact caused the case vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and come to rest in a different direction, while V2 also yawed counterclockwise and came to rest in the eastbound through-lane.
