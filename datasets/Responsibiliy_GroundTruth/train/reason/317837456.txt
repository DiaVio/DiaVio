The reason for this is that V2 attempted to overtake and pass V1, but then abruptly moved back into its original lane, encroaching into V1's lane. This sudden maneuver by V2 forced the driver of V1 to steer right onto the roadside in an attempt to avoid contact. This evasive action ultimately led to V1 losing control, contacting a culvert, tripping on a dirt mound, and rolling multiple times before coming to rest. Therefore, the actions of V2 in attempting to overtake and then abruptly moving back into its original lane without ensuring a safe distance or clearance for V1, directly contributed to the sequence of events that led to the accident.
