The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed greater than the posted speed limit and was driving too fast for the conditions. V1 attempted to steer left to avoid the impact with V2 (the Honda CR-V), but lost control of the vehicle and ultimately caused the collision. Additionally, the report mentions that V1 misjudged the gap and speed of the forward vehicle (V2) and did not adjust her speed accordingly, indicating a lack of attentiveness and awareness on the part of V1.
