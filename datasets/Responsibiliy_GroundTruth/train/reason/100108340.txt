The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made abrupt steering maneuvers, first steering left abruptly and then steering right abruptly, which caused the vehicle to leave the roadway and travel across the westbound lanes in a diagonal fashion. This sudden and erratic movement created a dangerous situation and ultimately led to the collision with vehicle two (V2), the 2003 Nissan Sentra. While the actions of the driver of V2, who made lane changes and came up along the right side of V1, may have contributed to the circumstances leading up to the accident, it was ultimately the actions of the driver of V1 that caused the collision and subsequent rollover. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of vehicle one (V1).
