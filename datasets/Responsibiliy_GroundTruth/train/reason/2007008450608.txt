The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions, which were described as snowy and icy. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being "too fast for conditions - icy roads." Additionally, the driver's statement that he saw a deer that might have startled him suggests that he may have been distracted or not fully focused on the road. Furthermore, the driver's fatigue could have also contributed to the crash. Working a full day as a union carpenter and then driving home after 15 hours of being awake could have impaired the driver's reaction time and decision-making abilities. While alcohol does not seem to be a factor in this case, the combination of excessive speed, poor road conditions, and possible fatigue ultimately led to the loss of control of V1 and the subsequent crash.
