The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which caused the vehicle to hit the right curb and barrier. Additionally, the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. The fact that the driver was issued a summons for speeding further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
