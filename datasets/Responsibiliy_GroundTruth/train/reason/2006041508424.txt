The driver of V1 made several errors that led to the accident. Firstly, instead of using the cul-de-sac to turn the vehicle around, the driver chose to reverse the vehicle in a northbound direction. This decision, combined with poor directional control, caused the vehicle to drive off the right side of the roadway and make contact with a concrete planter. Additionally, the driver's aggressive driving and unfamiliarity with the roadway likely contributed to the crash. The driver's account of being followed by another vehicle and reversing aggressively in response also raises questions about their state of mind and potential distraction or anger while driving. Overall, the driver's poor decision-making, lack of control, and potential emotional state make them primarily responsible for the accident.
