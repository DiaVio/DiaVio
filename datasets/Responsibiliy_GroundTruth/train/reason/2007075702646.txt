The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by a conversation with his friend and failed to pay attention to the road and the actions of other vehicles. He admitted to looking to his right and missing his intended turn, which caused him to enter the intersection without noticing that V2 (the 2005 Honda Odyssey) had already entered. Additionally, V1's inexperience as a new driver and unfamiliarity with the vehicle and the roadway likely contributed to his inability to properly assess the situation and take appropriate action to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's distracted driving, inattention, and failure to stop for the traffic control device make him primarily responsible for the accident.
