The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for the red traffic signal and entered the intersection illegally. This is evident from the police-reported travel speed, which indicates that V1 was traveling at 72 kmph (45 mph) when the traffic signal was red for their direction. The driver of V1 admitted that they did not realize the light was red until after entering the intersection. This disregard for the traffic signal resulted in the collision with vehicle two (V2), which was lawfully turning left on a green left turn light.
