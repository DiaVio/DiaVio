The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at 97 kmph (60 mph), which is the posted speed limit for the highway, but not the advisory speed limit for the ramp. The advisory speed limit for the ramp was 64 kmph (40 mph), indicating that a lower speed was recommended due to the wet road conditions and the curve of the ramp. Additionally, the right rear tire of V1 was underinflated and had a tread depth of only 1 mm, which could have contributed to the loss of control on the wet road. The driver's refusal to be interviewed also suggests a lack of cooperation in determining the cause of the crash.
