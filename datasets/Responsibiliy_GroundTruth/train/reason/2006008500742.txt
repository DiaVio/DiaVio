The driver of V2 recognized that V1 was stopped in his lane and came to a stop behind V3 while waiting for an opportunity to change lanes. However, the driver of V2 misjudged the situation and did not realize that V2 was completely stopped. As a result, when the driver of V3 came up behind V2 and realized that it was stopped, he did not have enough room to come to a complete stop due to the wet roadway. This led to V3 impacting the rear of V2 and pushing it forward along the right side of V1. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, which resulted in the collision.
