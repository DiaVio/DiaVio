The reason for V1's primary responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason coded in the report. The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed between 17mph and 21mph over the speed limit, which was considered too fast for the road conditions. Additionally, the driver had only owned the vehicle for two months and may have been less familiar with its handling characteristics. While the crumbling edge of the road was coded as a highway-related factor, it is believed that if the driver had maintained control of the vehicle, this would not have been an issue. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 and the driver's poor directional control.
