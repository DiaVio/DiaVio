The reason for this is that V2 was stopped at the intersection, preparing to turn left, and as V1 entered the intersection, V2 began its left turn. According to the driver of V1, he was not expecting V2 to pull out and there was not enough time to avoid crashing into it. Therefore, V2's action of turning left into the path of oncoming traffic can be considered as the main cause of the accident.
