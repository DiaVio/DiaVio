The reason for this is that the injuries sustained by the driver, such as the left periorbital contusion, open depressed vault skull fracture, base skull fracture, fracture of the right midshaft clavicle, cerebral lacerations, left neck abrasion, anterior mid torso contusion, bilateral hemothorax, hemomediastinem, liver laceration, comminuted right distal femur fracture, and closed dislocated left ankle fracture, are all attributed to various impacts within the vehicle during the accident. These injuries indicate that the driver was not properly protected by the vehicle's safety features, such as the three-point belt and steering-wheel airbag. The driver's movement forward and outboard relative to the vehicle interior suggests that she was not adequately restrained during the impact with the utility pole and subsequent collision with the tree. Additionally, the injuries to different parts of the body, such as the head, neck, torso, and lower extremities, indicate multiple points of impact within the vehicle, further suggesting that the driver's injuries were primarily caused by the dynamics of the accident and the vehicle's design. Therefore, V1, the 2009 four-door Mitsubishi Lancer, is primarily responsible for the accident.
