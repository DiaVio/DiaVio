The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted left and partially entered the left eastbound travel lane, heading west, while attempting to pass a non-contacted vehicle. This action caused Vehicle 1 (the 2005 Dodge Caravan minivan) to swerve left in order to avoid a collision, resulting in the offset frontal collision between the two vehicles. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2's failure to maintain their lane and drifting into oncoming traffic is the primary cause of the accident.
