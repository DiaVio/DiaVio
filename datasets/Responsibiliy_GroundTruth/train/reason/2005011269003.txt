The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made incorrect evasive actions when a non-contact vehicle swerved into her lane. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle and staying on the roadway, the driver of V1 swerved multiple times, ultimately leaving the roadway and entering the grassy median. This resulted in V1 rolling and colliding with V2 (the 2003 Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle) in the northbound lanes. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was also taking prescribed medication for depression, which could have potentially contributed to her incorrect evasive actions, such as dizziness or drowsiness. However, the primary responsibility still lies with V1 for not maintaining control of the vehicle and making multiple erratic maneuvers.
