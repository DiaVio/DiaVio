The reason for this is that V1 skidded off the right roadside and made contact with a sign with its right side. V1 then continued off the roadway and collided with an embankment, ultimately rolling onto its left side. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, failed to negotiate the switchback left curve, and ultimately caused the accident.
