The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling too fast for the curve, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. - The driver admitted to drinking half a beer and had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .04, indicating the presence of alcohol. - V1's tires were in bad condition, and the driver was aware of this fact but did not know the extent of the damage. - The driver was unfamiliar with the roadway, rarely driving on it, which could have contributed to her inability to negotiate the curve properly. These factors collectively indicate that V1's driver was negligent in her actions, including driving too fast for the curve, consuming alcohol before driving, and not maintaining the vehicle's tires in good condition.
