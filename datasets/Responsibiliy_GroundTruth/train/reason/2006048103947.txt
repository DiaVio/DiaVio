The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically while negotiating a curve. The police reported travel speed of 113 kmph (70 mph) indicates that V1 was exceeding the posted speed limit of 72 kph (45 mph). Additionally, the critical reason stated in the report is "driver related factor: too fast for curve/turn." Furthermore, the fact that V1 departed the roadway multiple times, re-entered, and then ultimately struck a tree suggests a loss of control due to excessive speed. The presence of alcohol in the driver's system, along with a history of alcohol abuse, may have impaired their judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the driver's inability to navigate the curve safely.
