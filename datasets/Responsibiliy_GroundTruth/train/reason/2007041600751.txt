The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was engaging in aggressive driving behavior, including weaving through lanes, making rapid lane changes, and experiencing road rage. These actions contributed to the driver's decision to steer to the left and hit the brakes in response to the phantom vehicle cutting into their lane and slamming on the brakes. This ultimately led to V1 departing the roadway and colliding with the concrete median wall.
