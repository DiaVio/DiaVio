The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, indicating a failure to yield to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "traveling, crossing over (passing through) intersection," suggesting that V1 was not following the proper traffic rules and regulations. On the other hand, V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Express van) was coded with the critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." This indicates that V2 was not at fault for the collision, as V1 was the one who entered the intersection without the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield and entering the intersection without the right of way.
