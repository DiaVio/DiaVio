The reason for this is that V1 lost control on the slushy roadway and started to rotate counter clockwise. V1 then crossed all travel lanes and ran off the left side of the road, impacting a jersey median barrier. The driver did not adapt her driving to the adverse weather and roadway conditions, which were described as slick due to the snow. This indicates that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions and had poor directional control, leading to the accident.
