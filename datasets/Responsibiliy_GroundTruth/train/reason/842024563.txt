The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 exited the curve and continued in a forward tracking mode across the centerline, entering the westbound lane and crossing the path of Vehicle 1. This resulted in the front left area of Vehicle 1 being impacted by the front left area of Vehicle 2. Vehicle 2's actions of crossing into the opposing lane and causing the collision indicate that it was primarily responsible for the accident.
