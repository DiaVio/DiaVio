The reason for this is that V1 experienced a blowout and subsequent loss of control due to tread separation in the right rear tire. This caused V1 to rotate and veer off the left side of the road, resulting in a rollover. While the driver of V1 was not interviewed and no further information is available, the critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as a driver-related factor: overcompensation. This suggests that the driver may have overcorrected their steering in response to the initial loss of control, exacerbating the situation and leading to the crash.
