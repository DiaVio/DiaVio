The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a left-hand turn onto the eastbound road at a high rate of speed, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. This is supported by the presence of yaw marks in the westbound lane and witnesses hearing rapid acceleration and tires squealing prior to the crash. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as he had never driven this vehicle before, and the fact that his license was revoked further contribute to his responsibility for the accident.
