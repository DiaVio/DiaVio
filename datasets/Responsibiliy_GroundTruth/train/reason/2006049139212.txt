The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection across the path of V2 (the 1999 Volkswagen Jetta driven by the 31-year-old female). V2 was already traveling in the intersection and had the right of way. V1's misjudgment of the gap or the speed of V2 led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 thought there was enough time to pass through the intersection, indicating a lack of awareness and understanding of the traffic situation. Therefore, V1's actions and misjudgment of the situation make them primarily responsible for the accident.
