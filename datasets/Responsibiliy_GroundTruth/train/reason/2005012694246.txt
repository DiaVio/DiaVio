The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to poor road conditions (slick road condition) caused by black ice. The driver's attempt to avoid the crash by steering right was unsuccessful, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (2004 Trail Blazer).
