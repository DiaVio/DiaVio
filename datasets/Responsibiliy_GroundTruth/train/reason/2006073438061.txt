The reason for V1's responsibility is due to the driver-related factors. The driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.191, which is significantly above the legal limit. Additionally, the driver was taking Ambien as a medication, which can impair cognitive and motor functions. These factors likely contributed to the driver's poor directional control, causing V1 to depart the roadway and collide with the utility pole.
