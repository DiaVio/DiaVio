The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an abrupt and unexpected change in direction without properly checking if the lane was clear. This is evident from the driver's statement that he initially signaled to turn left but then quickly changed his mind and attempted to turn right. This sudden change in direction without proper surveillance led to the collision with V2, which was attempting to pass V1 on the right. In summary, V1's inadequate surveillance and sudden change in direction without notice or checking for clearance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
