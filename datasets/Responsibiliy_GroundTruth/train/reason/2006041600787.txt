The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated while trying to avoid the crash that happened in front of her. This overcompensation led to V1 leaving the roadway and colliding with the concrete barrier wall. Although V1's actions were driven by the erratic behavior of the white Cadillac and the desire to avoid the crash, the driver's overcompensation ultimately resulted in the collision.
