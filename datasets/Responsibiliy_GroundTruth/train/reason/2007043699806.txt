The reason for V1's responsibility is the unknown recognition error, as stated in the critical reason for the vehicle. The driver of V1 may have misinterpreted the flashing yellow turn signal, which indicates that the corresponding traffic should yield the right of way when turning. This lack of recognition led to V1 turning left in front of V2, causing the collision. Additionally, the weather conditions of rain and wet roadway may have contributed to the driver's error in judgment. It is important to note that V2 (the Oldsmobile Intrigue) had the right of way as it was traveling straight through the intersection. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right, but was unable to do so due to V1's improper left turn. Overall, V1's failure to recognize the right of way and properly interpret the traffic signal, along with the adverse weather conditions, make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
