The reason for this is that V2 crossed the center lane lines and entered V1's travel lane, causing V1 to take evasive action to avoid a collision. V2 then returned to the southbound lane, resulting in the front-end impact with V1. This sequence of events indicates that V2 was the vehicle that initiated the dangerous maneuver by crossing into oncoming traffic, ultimately leading to the collision.
