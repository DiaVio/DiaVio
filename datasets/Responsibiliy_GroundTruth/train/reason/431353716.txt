The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and impacted the left side of V2, which was attempting to execute a left turn. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 continued in a southerly direction after the initial impact, suggesting that V1 may have been traveling at a higher speed than V2 or failed to take appropriate evasive action to avoid the collision. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unrestrained, despite the availability of a 3-point manual belt with a retractor type pretensioner. This lack of restraint may have contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries. Overall, the actions of V1 in failing to yield the right of way and the driver's lack of restraint make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
