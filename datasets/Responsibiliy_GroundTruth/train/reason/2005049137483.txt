The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a map while entering the intersection. This distraction likely caused him to fail to notice V2 (the 1994 Cadillac Deville sedan) until it was too late, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he was in a hurry, indicating a possible disregard for traffic rules and safety. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to yield to V2's right of way make him primarily responsible for the accident.
