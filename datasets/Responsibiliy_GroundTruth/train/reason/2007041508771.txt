The driver of V1 admitted to briefly taking his eyes off the road and being distracted by something, although he couldn't recall what it was. This distraction caused him to fail to recognize that he was overtaking the vehicle in front of him until it was too late. He locked his brakes but was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision with the back of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to a driver-related recognition error and external distraction.
