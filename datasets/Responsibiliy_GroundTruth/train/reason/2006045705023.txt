The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to look far enough ahead and falsely assumed that the minivan would yield the right of way. Additionally, Vehicle #1 chose an inappropriate evasive action by swerving left and braking, which resulted in a head-on collision with Vehicle #2. The driver of Vehicle #1 also had impaired vision, being nearsighted and not wearing corrective lenses at the time of the crash. These factors contribute to Vehicle #1's responsibility for the accident.
