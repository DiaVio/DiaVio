The reason for this is that V2 was traveling behind the unknown vehicle that had stopped in the eastbound lane to make a left turn. V2 began to swerve to the left while braking, causing it to rotate counterclockwise over the centerline into the westbound lane. The front of V1 impacted the front of V2 on the east side of the intersection, indicating that V2 was in the wrong lane at the time of the collision.
