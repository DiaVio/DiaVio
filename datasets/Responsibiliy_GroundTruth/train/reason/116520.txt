The reason for this is that the driver of V1 relinquished control of her car due to a medical condition, which caused V1 to drift to the left and cross the paved median, northbound lanes, and depart the left side of the road. This loss of control and subsequent actions led to the vehicle vaulting into the air and ultimately rolling down the embankment.
