The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the Lincoln MKX). V1 stated that she did not see V2 prior to making the left turn. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right-of-way to V2. On the other hand, V2 saw V1 turning in front of her and attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering to the right. This shows that V2 was aware of the situation and took appropriate evasive action. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
