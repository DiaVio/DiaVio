The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was under the influence of illegal drugs, as confirmed by police testing. - The driver of V1 was confused about the time of day, nervous, and frightened during the interview, indicating impaired cognitive function. - Witness one stated that it appeared the driver had fallen asleep, while witness two stated that V1 just drove off the right road edge. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: off the edge of the road on the right side" and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor: sleeping, that is, actually asleep". Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1's driver being under the influence of drugs and potentially falling asleep while driving indicates their primary responsibility for the crash.
