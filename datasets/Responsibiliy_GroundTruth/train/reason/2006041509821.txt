The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a recognition error and had inadequate surveillance. Despite looking carefully in both directions before crossing the roadway, V1 failed to see V2 (the driver of the Chevy Suburban) approaching and pulled out in front of them. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had been drinking alcohol prior to the crash, which is a non-performance error and further contributes to their responsibility.
