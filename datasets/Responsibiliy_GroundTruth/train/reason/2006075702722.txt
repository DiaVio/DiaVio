The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking for signage to get back onto the highway, which diverted her focus from the road. Additionally, the driver was fatigued due to lack of sleep and had already driven for a considerable amount of time that day. These factors likely contributed to her failure to notice the red light or properly assess the traffic situation, resulting in the collision with V2.
