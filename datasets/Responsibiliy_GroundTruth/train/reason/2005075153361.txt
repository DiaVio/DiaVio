The reason for this is that V1 was turning left across a double yellow lane line towards a private drive, which is a maneuver that requires caution and yielding to oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1 had an obstructed view due to the non-contact vehicles in the travel lanes, which further contributed to the driver's inability to safely complete the turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Ram pickup) was traveling in the correct lane and did not encroach into the opposite lane. Therefore, V2 cannot be primarily responsible for the accident.
