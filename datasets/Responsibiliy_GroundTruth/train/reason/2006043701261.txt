The reason for this is that V2, the Honda Accord sedan, was the vehicle that failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and entered the intersection without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 stated that he looked both ways but did not see the approaching V1, which indicates inadequate surveillance. Additionally, it was mentioned that the driver of V2 was taking Tylenol for flu symptoms at the time of the crash, which could have potentially affected his alertness and perception. Therefore, V2's failure to yield and inadequate surveillance are the main factors contributing to the crash, making V2 primarily responsible.
