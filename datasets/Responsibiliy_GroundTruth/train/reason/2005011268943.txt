The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event being coded as "This vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." Additionally, the driver's attempt to pass the pick-up truck while already traveling at a stated speed of 70mph suggests a lack of caution and awareness of the surrounding traffic. The driver's decision to swerve onto the left shoulder and then overcorrect by turning the steering wheel to the right further contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
