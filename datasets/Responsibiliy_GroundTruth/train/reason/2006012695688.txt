The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V2 was found to have inadequate surveillance, as she either failed to look or looked but did not see V1 approaching the intersection. These factors contributed to V2 encroaching into the path of V1, resulting in the collision.
