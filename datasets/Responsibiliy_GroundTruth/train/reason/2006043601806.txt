Reason: V1 failed to stop when the light turned red for him and entered the intersection, causing the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's driver license was suspended, indicating a history of traffic violations and non-compliance with traffic laws. The driver's inexperience with the rental car and unfamiliarity with the ABS braking system may have also contributed to the inability to avoid the crash.
