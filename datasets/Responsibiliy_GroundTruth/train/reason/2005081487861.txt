The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn with an obstructed view. The stopped traffic in the number one westbound lane created a sight restriction for both vehicles. V1 should have ensured that it had a clear view of oncoming traffic before initiating the left turn. By failing to do so, V1 entered the roadway and turned left without being able to see V2 approaching in the number two lane. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
