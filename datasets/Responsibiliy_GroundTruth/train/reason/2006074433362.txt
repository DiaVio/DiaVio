The driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of the oncoming V2 (the 2002 Nissan Sentra sedan) while attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. This misjudgment led to V1 being impacted on the right side by the front of V2. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and subsequent action of turning left without ensuring a safe gap or speed of oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
