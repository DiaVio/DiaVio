The reason for this is that V2 was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, which was identified as the Critical Precrash Event for V2. This indicates that V2 was not maintaining proper lane discipline and encroached into the adjacent lane, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V2's travel and impact speeds to be 96 kmph (60 mph), which is the posted speed limit for the roadway. This suggests that V2 was not exceeding the speed limit, further indicating that V2's failure to maintain lane position was the primary cause of the accident. It is important to note that both drivers were taking prescription medications, but there is no indication that these medications played a role in the accident.
