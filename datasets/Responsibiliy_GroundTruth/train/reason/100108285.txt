The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver allowed the vehicle to travel off the right side of the road, possibly due to fatigue. This indicates a lack of attention and control over the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's abrupt steering maneuver to regain the roadway caused the vehicle to lose control and initiate a counterclockwise yaw, leading to the rollover and subsequent crash. The deflated right front tire and the loading of that wheel into the soft dirt further contributed to the loss of control. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and lack of control, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
