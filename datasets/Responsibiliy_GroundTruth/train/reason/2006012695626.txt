The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by trying to close the door while driving, which led to her losing control of the vehicle and ultimately causing the crash. Additionally, the vehicle's door latch was found to be not working, indicating a vehicle deficiency that contributed to the driver's inability to properly secure the door. The driver's inexperience, insufficient braking and steering, and a wheel deficiency were also associated factors that contributed to the accident.
