The driver of V1 was traveling above the speed limit on a wet roadway, which led to poor directional control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was distracted by being on her cell phone and claimed to be chased by another unknown vehicle. These factors contributed to V1 sliding on the wet surface and ultimately colliding with the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2).
