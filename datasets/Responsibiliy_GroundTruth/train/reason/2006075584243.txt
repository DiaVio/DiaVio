The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver changed lanes into lane two and started to enter lane three without maintaining control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 losing control, rotating counterclockwise, and re-entering lane two where V2 (the 2006 Peterbilt tractor) was traveling. The impact between V1 and V2 occurred due to V1's loss of control and failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the driver of V1 was reported to be under the influence of Exlain, which may have impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. The driver's aggressive driving behavior, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as such, further supports V1's primary responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle, improper lane change, and potential impairment from Exlain.
