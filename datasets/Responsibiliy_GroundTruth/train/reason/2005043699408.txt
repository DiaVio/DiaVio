The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver knowingly entered the roadway with a vehicle that had a brake system failure. Despite realizing that the brakes were inoperable, V1 proceeded to cross the roadway, which ultimately led to the collision with V2 (the driver of the 2002 Ford Mustang). V1's decision to enter the roadway without functioning brakes directly contributed to the crash.
