The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 broke traction on the wet road surface and entered the center median area in a clockwise rotation, impacting a concrete "jersey" barrier. This initial impact resulted in moderate vehicle damage and subsequently re-directed Vehicle 1 back into the westbound travel lane. Vehicle 2 (the 1999 Chevrolet Silverado K2500) was traveling behind Vehicle 1 and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering right. However, Vehicle 2 still ended up striking the right side of Vehicle 1, causing severe damage and re-directing it back into the center median. Therefore, the actions of Vehicle 1 in losing traction and entering the median area initiated the chain of events that led to the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
