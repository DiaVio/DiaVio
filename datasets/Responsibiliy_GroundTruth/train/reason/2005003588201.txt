The driver of Vehicle #1 was attempting an illegal U-turn on a non-junction roadway, which is a decision error and an illegal maneuver. The Critical Pre-Crash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #1 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic in the left lane before attempting the U-turn. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
