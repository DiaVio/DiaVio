The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 78-year-old female, was asleep at the wheel. This was determined to be a driver-related factor and the critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. The driver's family had noticed that she was frequently dozing off due to recent changes in her medication, and she was also taking a sleep aid. Additionally, it is unknown whether she was wearing her corrective lenses at the time of the crash.
