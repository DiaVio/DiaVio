The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver claimed to have a green light, but the investigation revealed that V2 (the driver of the 1999 Mercury Sable) actually had the green light. V1's inadequate surveillance, coupled with their fatigue and medication for a sinus headache, contributed to their failure to see V2 approaching and resulted in the collision.
