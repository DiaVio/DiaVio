The reason for V1's responsibility is that the tread on the right rear tire separated, causing V1 to lose control of the vehicle. This tire/wheel failure was identified as the critical reason for the collision. Additionally, a witness following behind V1 stated that the vehicle was weaving back and forth on the roadway before running off the right road edge, indicating that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle prior to the tire failure.
