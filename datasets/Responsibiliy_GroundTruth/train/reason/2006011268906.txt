The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to completely stop at the stop sign and began a left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic. This is considered an illegal maneuver and indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver. Additionally, V1's statement that they rolled through the stop sign and only realized traffic was coming from their right after starting the turn further supports their responsibility. While V2 may have assumed that V1 would stop before entering the intersection, V1's failure to yield the right of way is the main contributing factor to the accident. The wet condition of the roadway may have played a role in the accident, but it does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for not following traffic rules and properly assessing the situation before making the left turn.
