The reason for this is that V2 was turning into the opposite direction of V1's travel, which is considered an encroachment. V2 stated that they had the green light, indicating that they had the right of way. However, V1 was in the left turn lane, which means they were intending to make a left turn at the intersection. V2 should have yielded to V1 before making their turn. Additionally, V2 mentioned that they were late for a football game and may have been in a hurry. This could have contributed to their failure to yield to V1. Overall, V2's failure to yield and encroachment into the path of V1 makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
