The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 initiated the sequence of events by veering off the road and colliding with a highway construction barrel. This initial impact did not alter the vehicle's trajectory, and Vehicle 1 continued on the shoulder before subsequently colliding with a W-beam guardrail. This collision caused moderate damage to Vehicle 1 and redirected it back into the westbound travel lanes, where it crossed the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2010 Toyota Rav4) and collided with its front right area. The impact with Vehicle 2 resulted in additional frontal damage to Vehicle 1 and compounded its rotation. Vehicle 1 then collided with the concrete barrier before coming to a final rest on the bridge overpass. Therefore, Vehicle 1's actions of veering off the road, colliding with the guardrail, and subsequently colliding with Vehicle 2 indicate that it is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
