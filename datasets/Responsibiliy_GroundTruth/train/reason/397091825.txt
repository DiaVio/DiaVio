The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that it struck the rear end of V3, causing V2 to jackknife and cross the centerline into the northbound travel lane. Subsequently, V1 struck V2 in the right saddle tank area. This sequence of events suggests that V2's initial impact with V3 led to the subsequent collision with V1.
