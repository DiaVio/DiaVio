The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was traveling straight in the eastbound lane. The driver of Vehicle 2 falsely assumed that Vehicle 1 would turn left (north) and did not have her left turn signal on. This false assumption led to the collision between the front of Vehicle 1 and the right side of Vehicle 2.
