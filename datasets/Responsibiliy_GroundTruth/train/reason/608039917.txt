The reason for this is that V1 was crossing through the intersection and entered the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2004 Toyota Camry, which was already traveling on the intersecting roadway. V1's failure to yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, V1's subsequent departure from the roadway and severe impact with the building further indicates V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
