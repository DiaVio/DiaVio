The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize that V2 had stopped at the intersection ahead. This is indicated by the driver-related recognition error, where V1 was looking at V2 but did not realize it had stopped. Additionally, V1 has only been driving for two years and has received no formal driver training, which may have contributed to the lack of awareness and recognition of the stopped vehicle. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1986 Mercedes-Benz) was engaged in conversation with the passenger and was commenting on another vehicle running a red light. However, this does not directly contribute to the cause of the accident, as V2 was stopped at the time of the impact. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related recognition error and lack of awareness of the stopped vehicle ahead.
