The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to the icy roadway conditions. V1 departed off the right side of the road, impacting the bottom of the muddy ditch and subsequently rolling over. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle on the icy road led to the sequence of events that caused the accident.
