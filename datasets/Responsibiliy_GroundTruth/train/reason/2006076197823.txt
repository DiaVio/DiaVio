The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver admitted to traveling too fast and losing control while trying to negotiate the right curve. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 89 kmph, which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 64 kph and the advisory speed limit of 56 kph for the curves. This indicates that the driver was exceeding the recommended speed for the curve, which contributed to the vehicle running off the road and ultimately crashing into the embankment.
