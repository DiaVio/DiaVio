The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 misjudged the gap and speed of Vehicle #2 and attempted to make a left turn across westbound traffic without stopping. This action resulted in Vehicle #1 being struck on its right side by Vehicle #2. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was reported to be inattentive and talking on a cell phone at the time of the crash, which further contributed to the misjudgment and failure to yield the right of way.
