The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, which is an associated factor in this crash. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and their inexperience contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
