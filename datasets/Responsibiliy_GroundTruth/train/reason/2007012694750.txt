The driver of V1 noticed a maroon vehicle drifting over the lane line from the right and attempted to avoid it by moving from lane 3 to lane 4. However, instead of successfully maneuvering back onto the roadway, V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway and lost control of the vehicle. The driver's poor directional control and inadequate evasive action contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver's work stress, as mentioned in the case summary, may have affected their ability to react appropriately in the situation. However, it is important to note that the responsibility for the crash lies with the driver of V1, as they failed to control their vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected and did not take sufficient measures to avoid the collision.
