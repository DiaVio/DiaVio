The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was not able to maintain its original southbound travel lane while negotiating the curved section of roadway. Despite the driver's attempts to counter-steer and maintain control, Vehicle 1 crossed over into the northbound travel lane and ultimately collided with a tree. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to properly navigate the curve and maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
