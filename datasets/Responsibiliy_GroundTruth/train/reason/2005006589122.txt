The reason for this is that Vehicle Two was cut off by another car traveling at a fast speed, which caused the collision. Vehicle Two lost control of the vehicle and ultimately hit the cement divider by the bridge support. The actions of the other car, which cut off Vehicle Two, can be considered as a contributing factor to the accident. However, without further information about the circumstances leading to the control loss of Vehicle Two, it is difficult to determine any additional factors that may have played a role in the crash.
