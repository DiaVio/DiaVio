The driver of V1 admitted to being sleepy and made a left turn into a driveway without adequately surveilling the road. This driver recognition error, combined with the possibility of being focused on the turn destination and not observing V2, led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, which likely impaired their ability to react appropriately. V2 (the Ford Taurus) cannot be primarily held responsible for the accident as the critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. Although the driver of V2 was using prescription medication, it is not directly linked to the cause of the accident. V2's involvement in the accident was a result of V1's failure to yield and encroachment into the opposite lane.
