The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One was found to be asleep at the wheel, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to being tired and sleepy, and stated that she had yawned just prior to reaching the intersection and does not remember anything after that. This indicates that she was not alert and in control of her vehicle at the time of the accident. Additionally, Vehicle One was traveling in the second lane of the eastbound roadway, while Vehicle Two (the 2004 Oldsmobile Alero) was stopped at the light facing north. Vehicle Two began turning left when the front of Vehicle One struck its left side. This suggests that Vehicle Two had the right of way and was making a legal maneuver at the time of the collision. Therefore, based on the driver's sleepiness and lack of control over the vehicle, as well as the fact that Vehicle Two was making a legal turn, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident.
