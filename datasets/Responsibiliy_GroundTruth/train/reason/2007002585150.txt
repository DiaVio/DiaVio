The reason for this is that V1 drove off the right side of the roadway, indicating poor direction control by the driver. The driver stated that he attempted to steer left, but the vehicle would not turn. This suggests a driver-related performance error. Additionally, the driver's use of prescription medications and the wet road conditions were associated factors that contributed to the crash.
