The injuries sustained by the case occupant, such as the head injuries and fractures, suggest that the occupant's head struck the right window sill due to her short stature. This indicates that the impact came from the side where the case occupant was seated, which is consistent with the position of the 2007 Lexus ES350 sedan (V1) as the front right passenger. Additionally, there is no mention of any significant injuries or damages caused by the 2002 Lincoln Continental sedan (V2). Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the 2007 Lexus ES350 sedan (V1) is primarily responsible for the accident.
