The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected deceleration of V2. The driver of V1 admitted to changing lanes and then applying the brakes when he realized V2 was slowing down, but he was not able to stop in time to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react appropriately to the changing conditions on the road. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating," further supporting the fact that V1 failed to adjust their speed and maintain a safe distance from V2. Therefore, V1's failure to drive at a safe speed and maintain a proper following distance makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
