The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was stopped in the westbound travel lane, intending to turn left into a private driveway. It is the responsibility of the driver of Vehicle 2 to ensure that it is safe to make the left turn and yield to oncoming traffic. In this case, Vehicle 1 (2005 Nissan Frontier pick-up truck) was approaching from the rear and collided with the rear plane of Vehicle 2. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way, resulting in the accident.
