The reason for this is that V1 veered to the left, jumped the curb, and struck a small tree before continuing southbound and hitting a circular brick planter. It then crossed the east/westbound road, careened off the south curb, and began traveling eastbound. V1 ultimately struck a tree and came to a rest facing north. The driver of V1 reported that the vehicle began making loud strange noises and that she could not control it. However, she also mentioned that she tried steering to bring the vehicle under control and aimed it at the tree to bring it to a stop. This indicates that she had some control over the vehicle. Additionally, factors such as the driver's physical condition (bad knee, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, and taking multiple medications) and poor directional control were associated with V1. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the associated factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
