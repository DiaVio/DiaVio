The driver of V1 was distracted while driving, as she leaned over to get a phone number off the floor. This internal distraction caused her to enter the intersection without paying proper attention to her surroundings. As a result, V2 (the driver of the 1990 Toyota Corolla station wagon) collided with the left side of V1. Although V2 was also involved in the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the crossing street. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and was proceeding through the intersection when V1 entered and caused the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her internal distraction and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
