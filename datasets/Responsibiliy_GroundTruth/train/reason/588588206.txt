The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to negotiate the left turning curve of the roadway due to a prior medical condition. This caused Vehicle 1 to depart from the right side of the roadway and collide with two trees. The driver's inability to control the vehicle and stay on the road ultimately led to the accident.
