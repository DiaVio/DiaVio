The driver of V1 falsely assumed that the vehicle in front of him would continue to proceed due to the green light, leading to a driver-related decision error. This false assumption caused V1 to collide with the back of V2 (the 2006 Toyota Scion Xb), which then resulted in V2 being pushed into the back of V3 (the 2002 Ford F-150). Therefore, V1's failure to anticipate the actions of the vehicle in front of him and maintain a safe following distance is the main reason for the accident.
