The driver of Vehicle One stated that she started to brake when the stoplight turned red, but the vehicle slid off the roadway due to the slick road conditions. It is important for drivers to adjust their driving behavior according to the road conditions, especially when it is snowing and sleeting. The driver should have been more cautious and reduced her speed to ensure better control of the vehicle on the icy and slippery road. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adapt to the road conditions.
