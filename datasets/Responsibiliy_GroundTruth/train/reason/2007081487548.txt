The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by reaching for a cell phone and failed to notice that V2 had slowed down quickly along with the traffic ahead. This distraction caused V1 to be unable to stop in time and resulted in the rear-end collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only four hours of sleep the previous evening and had been working long hours, indicating fatigue as a contributing factor.
