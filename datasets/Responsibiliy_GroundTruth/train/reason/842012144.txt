The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling northbound on a two-lane rural roadway and entered a left curve. However, it departed the right (east) pavement edge and entered a roadside ditch, resulting in a culvert impact and counterclockwise rotation. This tripping mechanism initiated a rollover sequence, during which Vehicle 1 struck a U-channel sign post and a brick wall. The lack of restraint usage by the unrestrained driver of Vehicle 1 also contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained in the accident.
