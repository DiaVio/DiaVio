The reason for this is that the 1997 Buick Century sedan (V1) initially moved rearward into the seat back in response to the severe impact from V2. The subsequent rebound off the seat back caused the driver of V1 to flex forward and eventually come into contact with the center-console prior to the second impact with the 1994 Pontiac Grand Prix. Therefore, V2 is considered primarily responsible for the accident as its impact initiated the chain of events leading to the driver of V1 coming into contact with the center-console and experiencing various injuries.
