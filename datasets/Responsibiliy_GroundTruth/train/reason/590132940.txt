The reason for this is that V2 struck the right-front of Vehicle 1 (V1) at the front-left, causing the impact. V2 was traveling northbound and entered the intersection simultaneously with V1, which was traveling eastbound. The 2 o'clock principal direction of force impact indicates that V2 was at fault for not yielding the right of way to V1. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
