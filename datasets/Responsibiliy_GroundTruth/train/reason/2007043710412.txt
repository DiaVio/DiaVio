The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the heavy rain conditions. Despite the heavy rain, the driver chose to drive at the posted speed limit, which caused the vehicle to hydroplane and lose control. This indicates a failure to adjust driving behavior to the prevailing weather conditions, making the driver primarily responsible for the accident.
