The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn from the third lane of traffic at the intersection, which indicates that they were crossing the path of oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1 had a protected left turn arrow at the intersection, which means they had a specific signal indicating it was safe to turn left. However, V1 may have had a limited view of V2 due to a vehicle stopped in the left turn lane of the northbound lanes. Despite this, V1 should have exercised caution and ensured that it was safe to make the left turn before proceeding. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2003 Oldsmobile Alero) was traveling in the first lane and did not stop for the changing traffic light. While V2 may have had limited visibility due to a vehicle stopped in the left turn lane, they still had a responsibility to obey traffic signals and exercise caution when approaching an intersection. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to ensure it was safe to make the left turn, despite having a protected left turn arrow.
