The reason for this is that Vehicle one was traveling northbound and proceeded through the intersection, impacting the left side of Vehicle two (1985 Buick La Sabre). This indicates that Vehicle one failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle two, which was traveling southwest in the first lane. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle one is not licensed, which suggests a lack of proper driving skills and knowledge of traffic rules. This further supports the conclusion that Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident.
