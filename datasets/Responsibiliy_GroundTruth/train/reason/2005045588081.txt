The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 intentionally ran off the right side of the road and struck a utility pole. The driver admitted to police that she intentionally ran into the pole, and there were no skids or apparent avoidance actions. Additionally, the driver was experiencing emotional upset, had a history of bipolar disorder, and was fatigued due to personal problems, which may have impaired her judgment and decision-making abilities. The presence of illegal drugs in her system also suggests impaired driving.
