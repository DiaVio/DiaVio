The reason for this is that V1 was northbound through the curve and departed the lane to the left, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2000 Toyota Tundra access cab pickup truck. V1's departure from the lane and subsequent impact with V2 suggests that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve, leading to the accident.
