The driver of V1 admitted to swerving into oncoming traffic due to coughing and a possible physical impairment caused by his cancer and ongoing treatment. This action directly led to the collision with V2 (the Infiniti Q45). Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their designated lane is the main reason for the crash.
