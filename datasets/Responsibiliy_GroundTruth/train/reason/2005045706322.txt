The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to stop and rear-ended Vehicle 2 (2003 Dodge 1500 Pickup) after both V2 and the vehicle in front of V2 braked suddenly due to the non-contact vehicle crossing the ramp. The driver of Vehicle 1 was distracted by the non-contact vehicle crossing in front of traffic, which caused a recognition error. This distraction led to the driver of Vehicle 1 not being able to react in time and stop, resulting in the rear-end collision.
