The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was inattentive to the driving task, as indicated by the coding of "inattention (i.e., daydreaming)" as the critical reason for the critical event. V1 failed to notice the change in traffic signal and the presence of V2 entering the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1's skid marks indicate that they were likely traveling at or above the posted speed limit, which may have contributed to the severity of the impact. V2 (the driver of the 1996 Ford Taurus) had been stopped for 5-10 seconds when the light turned green, and did not see V1 until the impact. While V2's actions may have contributed to the accident, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their inattentiveness and failure to react appropriately to the changing traffic conditions.
