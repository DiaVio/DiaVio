The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 encountered a downed tree that was laying laterally over both lanes and shoulders. Instead of being able to safely navigate around the tree, V1 ran over the tree trunk/limb and subsequently departed the roadway, resulting in a head-on collision with a large tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to exercise proper caution and control of the vehicle when faced with the obstacle on the road.
