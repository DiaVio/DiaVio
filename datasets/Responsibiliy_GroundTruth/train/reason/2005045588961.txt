The driver of Vehicle #1 rear-ended Vehicle #2 (the 2002 Mazda Millenia), which then caused a chain reaction resulting in Vehicle #2 rear-ending Vehicle #3 (the 1996 Chrysler Town and Country minivan). The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that traffic stopped abruptly and he was unable to stop in time. However, the police charged him with following too closely. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a violation of traffic laws and a common cause of rear-end collisions. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe following distance.
