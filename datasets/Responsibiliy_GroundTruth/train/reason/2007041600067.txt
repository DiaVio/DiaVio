The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering hard to the right in response to the road raged driver's actions. This sharp steering maneuver caused V1 to lose control and spin across three lanes of traffic, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2. The driver of V1's actions were the critical pre-crash event and the critical reason for the crash.
