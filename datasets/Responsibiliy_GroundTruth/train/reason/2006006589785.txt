The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Pontiac Grand Prix, made a left turn across the path of V1, the Ford Grand Marquis, without yielding the right of way. V2 stated that he saw V1 approaching from the opposing direction and thought she was going to stop completely, but he decided to proceed anyway. This decision was a false assumption of V1's actions, as she did not stop and ended up colliding with V2's vehicle. V1, on the other hand, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. She stated that she saw V2 approaching and thought he was going to yield to her, which is a reasonable expectation. Additionally, V1 was driving slightly over the speed limit, but this does not absolve V2 of responsibility for making an unsafe left turn. Therefore, V2's false assumption and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make him primarily responsible for the accident.
