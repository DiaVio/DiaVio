The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a U-turn from the eastbound lane, which is a dangerous maneuver and not allowed at this location. This action by V1 caused V2 (the driver of the 2006 Chevrolet HHR) to collide with the left side of V1. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; decelerating," indicating that V1 was slowing down before attempting the U-turn. This suggests that V1's sudden change in direction was unexpected and likely contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating," indicating that V2 was simply traveling behind V1 and decelerating as expected. V2's actions, such as steering to the left and applying the brakes to avoid the crash, suggest that V2 reacted appropriately to the sudden U-turn by V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their improper and unexpected U-turn maneuver.
