The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical event being coded as a driver-related factor. V1 was distracted internally by drinking orange juice and failed to look far enough ahead, which contributed to the collision. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a higher speed than estimated by the driver, further indicating a lack of caution and awareness. V2 (the driver of the Mercury Villager) was slowing down in response to the traffic in front of him and was not aware of V1 prior to the impact. While V2 may have been decelerating, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for following too closely and not being able to respond to the slowing traffic.
