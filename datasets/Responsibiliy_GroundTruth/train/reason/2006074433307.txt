The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without paying attention to the traffic signal. The driver admitted to being lost and looking for signs, and when she noticed a sign, she immediately turned left without considering the traffic signal. This action violated the traffic laws and resulted in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 1998 Chevrolet Cavalier) attempted to apply the brakes when she realized that V1 was entering the intersection, but skidded and could not stop in time. However, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's violation of the traffic signal, and therefore V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
