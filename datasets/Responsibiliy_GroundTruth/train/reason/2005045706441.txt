The reason for Vehicle 1's responsibility is as follows: - The driver of Vehicle 1 was fatigued, having not slept in the twenty-four hours prior to the crash. This critical non-performance error of sleeping while driving led to the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. - Additionally, the driver disclosed that he had been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana three hours prior to the crash, indicating impairment. - The driver's use of an allergy medication, an unnamed sleep disorder, and being in a hurry to get home were also contributing factors associated with the driver's responsibility. Overall, the combination of fatigue, impairment from alcohol and marijuana, and other associated factors make Vehicle 1 primarily responsible for the crash.
