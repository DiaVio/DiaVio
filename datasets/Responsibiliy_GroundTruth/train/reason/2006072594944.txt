The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering left to avoid the non-contact vehicle that cut him off from the right. This incorrect evasive action caused V1 to cross the adjacent left travel lane and collide with the north median barrier, resulting in the vehicle rolling over and coming to rest on its roof. The driver's failure to take appropriate evasive action and maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the crash.
