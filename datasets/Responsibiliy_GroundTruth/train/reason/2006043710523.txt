The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 attempted to switch lanes from lane two to lane three without ensuring it was safe to do so. - V1's attempt to switch lanes resulted in the left front of V1 contacting the right passenger side of V2. - After the impact, V1 lost control and began to travel in a clockwise yaw, indicating a loss of control. - V1 left yaw marks before contacting the right guardrail, further indicating a loss of control. - V1's loss of control ultimately led to the vehicle traveling down the embankment and colliding with trees. Therefore, V1's actions of attempting to switch lanes without ensuring it was safe and subsequently losing control of the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the crash.
