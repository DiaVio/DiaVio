The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on a red light, indicating that they failed to obey the traffic signal. Additionally, the driver of V1 was engaged in aggressive driving behavior, including failing to stop for several traffic control devices and speeding prior to the crash. These actions demonstrate a disregard for traffic laws and safety, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
