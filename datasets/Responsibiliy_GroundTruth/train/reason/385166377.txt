The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn from the parking lot area into the westbound travel lanes, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. Vehicle 2 (the 1995 Jeep Wrangler) was traveling in the center eastbound travel lane and had the right of way. Vehicle 1 failed to yield to Vehicle 2, resulting in the near side impact. Additionally, there is no mention of any contributing factors such as speeding or impairment on the part of Vehicle 2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 for failing to yield and causing the collision.
