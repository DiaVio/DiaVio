The driver of V1 admitted to overcompensating after regaining control of the vehicle, which ultimately led to the crash. This overcorrection was a driver-related error and a performance error. Additionally, the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as it was dark, rainy, and the road had recently been repaved with no road markings. The lack of road markings and the wet road surfaces were contributing factors to the accident.
