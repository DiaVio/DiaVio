The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being stopped and then failing to stop in time to avoid impacting the back of Vehicle #2. This indicates a lack of attention and failure to maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was preoccupied with work-related calls, further supporting the claim of driver inattention.
