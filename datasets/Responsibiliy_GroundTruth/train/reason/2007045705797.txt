The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the right side of the road, struck a mailbox and a tree, and ultimately came to rest facing northeast. The critical precrash event for V1 was traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, indicating that V1 failed to maintain control and stay within the designated roadway. The critical reason for the crash was coded as too fast for conditions, suggesting that V1 was traveling at a speed that was not appropriate for the dark, unlit, and rainy conditions on the curved road. Additionally, the narrow road without shoulders may have contributed to the difficulty in maintaining control. Overall, V1's departure from the road, striking of objects, and failure to maintain control indicate that it is primarily responsible for the crash.
