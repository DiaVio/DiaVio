The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She did not look to her left before entering the roadway, which resulted in her vehicle colliding with the right side of V2 (the Chevrolet F-150 pickup). Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
