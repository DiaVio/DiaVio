The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver-related factor of a heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. The driver, a 71-year-old female, suffers from various medical conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and abnormal heart rhythm. She takes multiple medications, including Coumadin, Dilantin, Digitek, Lasix, and Colestid. The driver's statement to the police, where she mentioned not knowing what happened and not recalling driving off the road, suggests a possible medical episode or impairment that led to the crash. The witness also reported seeing V1 gradually depart the right road edge and impact the guardrail before going down the embankment. Considering the driver's medical conditions, medications, and the witness's account, it is likely that the driver experienced a medical episode, such as a heart attack or loss of consciousness, which impaired her ability to control the vehicle and resulted in the crash.
