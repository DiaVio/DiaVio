The reason for this is that V1 crossed over into the westbound lane, rotated counterclockwise, and departed the roadway before impacting various objects such as a fire hydrant, a sign post, and a landscape rockery. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, resulting in the accident.
