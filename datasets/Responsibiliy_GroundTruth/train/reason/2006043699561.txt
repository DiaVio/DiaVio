The reason for V1's primary responsibility is driver inattention. The driver of V1 was preoccupied with her impending first day of work at a new job and had been unemployed prior. This driver's inattention led to her turning left at the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. As a result, V1 collided with V2 (the Nissan Pathfinder) which was proceeding straight in its lane.
