The reason for V1's responsibility is that she made a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 entered the intersection and came to a stop to wait for an opportunity to turn left. However, she proceeded to turn after the light entered the red phase, assuming that V2 would stop and yield her the right of way. This false assumption led to the collision with V2, as V2 was traveling straight through the intersection and did not have an obligation to yield to V1's left turn.
