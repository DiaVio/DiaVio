The driver of V2 admitted to being in a hurry and trying to "beat the light" in order to avoid waiting through another cycle. This indicates that the driver was not paying sufficient attention to the traffic signal and misjudged the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle (V1). Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," further suggesting that the driver's misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed while making the left turn contributed to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V1 was driving within her lane and proceeded into the intersection when she noticed that the signal was green. There is no indication that she was engaged in any negligent behavior that would make her primarily responsible for the accident.
