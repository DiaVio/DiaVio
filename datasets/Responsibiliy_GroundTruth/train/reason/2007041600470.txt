The reason for this is that V1, the unknown black vehicle, cut into lane two occupied by V2, the 2003 Saturn Vue utility vehicle, in an attempt to get off the interstate. This action caused V1 to clip the left front side of V2, resulting in V2 spinning out of control and eventually rolling over. Since V1 fled the scene and no further information was obtained about the driver or the factors associated with the critical pre-crash event, it is difficult to determine the exact reason for V1's actions. However, the fact that V1 made an abrupt lane change without ensuring it was safe to do so suggests a lack of caution and awareness, making V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
