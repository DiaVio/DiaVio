The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite the traffic signal being green, the driver did not see V2 (the Lincoln Mark 8) approaching from the opposite direction. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 entering the intersection and colliding with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that there were shadows from trees on the east curb before the intersection, which may have contributed to her inability to see V2. However, this does not absolve her of responsibility as drivers are expected to exercise caution and ensure the intersection is clear before making a turn. Furthermore, the driver of V1 stated that she rarely drives this road and was unfamiliar with it. This lack of familiarity may have also played a role in her failure to properly assess the situation and anticipate the presence of other vehicles. Overall, the driver of V1's inadequate surveillance, combined with her unfamiliarity with the road, led to the collision and makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
