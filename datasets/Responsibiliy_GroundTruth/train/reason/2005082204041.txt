The driver of Vehicle One admitted to forgetting about the stop sign at the intersection and stated that he wondered why the other vehicle ran the stop sign just before the collision. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle One failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, which is coded as "inadequate surveillance" and considered a driver-related factor. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two (the 1996 Toyota Tercel) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street across path," indicating that Vehicle Two was already in the intersection when the collision occurred. The critical reason for this event was not coded to Vehicle Two, suggesting that Vehicle Two was not at fault. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of forgetting the stop sign and inadequate surveillance, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the collision.
