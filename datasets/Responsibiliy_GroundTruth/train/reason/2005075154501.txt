The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 59-year-old female, had exited the vehicle and left it unattended. The 8-year-old child in the back seat, who was not properly restrained, climbed into the driver's seat and either accidentally shifted the transmission into drive or released the emergency brake. This resulted in the vehicle rolling down a steep grade, disregarding the stop sign, and ultimately colliding with a telephone pole.
