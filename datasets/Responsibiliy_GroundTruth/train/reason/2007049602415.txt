The reason for this is that V2 attempted to turn left into the apartment complex entrance, which is a maneuver that requires yielding to oncoming traffic. However, V2 failed to yield to V1, which was approaching from the opposite direction with its police lights activated. This failure to yield and sudden turn from its original lane into the apartment complex contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver of V2 fled the scene on foot, further indicating their responsibility for the incident.
