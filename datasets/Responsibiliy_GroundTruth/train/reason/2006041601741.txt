The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 drifted over the right lane line into lane 2, continued drifting to the right, and ultimately sideswiped V2 (the 2005 Ford Econoline van). The driver of V1 initially claimed to have swerved to avoid a dog, but there were no witnesses or physical evidence supporting this claim. The trajectory of V1 veering off the roadway was consistent with someone falling asleep or blacking out, rather than making an avoidance maneuver. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he did not remember what had happened, suggesting a possible blackout, seizure, or mini-stroke while driving. The driver of V1's medical condition of diabetes and the fact that he only drives that roadway monthly were also associated factors. In contrast, V2 (the driver of the 2005 Ford Econoline van) was not thought to have contributed to the crash. The Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane, over the left lane line. However, the Critical Reason was not coded to V2, and there were no associated factors indicating any fault on the part of the driver of V2.
