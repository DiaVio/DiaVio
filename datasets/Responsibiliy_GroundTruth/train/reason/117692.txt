The reason for this is that the driver was not using the available 3-point seat belt, which could have potentially prevented or minimized the severity of the injuries sustained. Additionally, the driver's loss of consciousness and possible pre-impact steering maneuver may indicate a lack of attention or control over the vehicle, contributing to the accident.
