The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 continued traveling straight as the roadway curved to the left, causing it to depart the right edge of the roadway and subsequently collide with various objects, including wooden posts, a drainage culvert, a gravel driveway, and utility pole support wires. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the lane, resulting in the collision.
