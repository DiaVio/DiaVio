The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Ford Mustang, entered the intersection when their signal turned green without adequately surveilling the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 failed to properly observe the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with V1.
