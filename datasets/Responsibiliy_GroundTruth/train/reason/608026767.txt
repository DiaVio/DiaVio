The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and began to rotate counterclockwise as it entered the acceleration lane. This loss of control caused V1 to cross the inside southbound lane and enter the path of V2, the 2004 International tractor and semi-trailer. V1 then under-rode the semi-trailer, resulting in a collision. Therefore, V1's loss of control and failure to maintain proper lane position ultimately led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
