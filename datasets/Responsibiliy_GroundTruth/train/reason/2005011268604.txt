The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a performance error by overcompensating when his tires hit the rumble strip on the shoulder. Instead of continuing straight on the left shoulder and potentially maintaining control, the driver panicked and quickly steered right, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle. This inappropriate and unsuccessful evasive action ultimately led to V1 leaving the roadway, crossing multiple lanes, and colliding with a tree. It is important to note that there were no reported mechanical defects with V1, and the driver was properly licensed, familiar with the vehicle, and the roadway conditions were clear and dry. Additionally, there were no indications of emotional, physical, or work-related issues that could have contributed to the driver's actions. Therefore, based on the driver's performance error and inappropriate evasive action, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
