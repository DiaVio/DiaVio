The reason for this is that V1's driver made a decision error by misjudging the gap or the speed of the disabled vehicle (V2) and attempting to maneuver around it. This decision ultimately led to the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, V1's driver was cited for failure to drive within a single lane, indicating that they were not able to safely navigate around the disabled vehicle.
