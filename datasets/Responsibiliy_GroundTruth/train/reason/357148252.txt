The reason for this is that the case vehicle crossed into the east bike lane, mounted a barrier curb, and ultimately struck a light pole. This indicates that the driver of the case vehicle lost control and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the collision with the light pole. Additionally, the fact that the vehicle rotated off the pole suggests that the impact was significant and likely caused by the case vehicle's actions.
