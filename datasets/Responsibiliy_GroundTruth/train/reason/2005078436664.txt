The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high speed of approximately 136-144 kmph (85-90 mph), which was too fast for the conditions of the roadway. Additionally, the driver admitted to being scared by a non-contact vehicle passing him, which caused him to panic and lose control of his vehicle. This panic/freezing reaction further supports the driver's responsibility for the crash.
