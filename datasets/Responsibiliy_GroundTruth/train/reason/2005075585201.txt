The reason for this is that Vehicle two was the one that struck the left side of Vehicle one, causing it to rotate and come to rest facing west on the west side of the intersection. Vehicle two then continued to rotate counterclockwise and struck the left side of Vehicle three. Although Vehicle one entered the intersection at the same time as Vehicle two, it is stated that Vehicle two realized that Vehicle one wasn't stopping but it was too late to take any action to avoid the crash. This suggests that Vehicle two failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle one, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, Vehicle three was able to brake and nearly stop prior to the impact with Vehicle two, indicating that the driver of Vehicle three was attentive and took appropriate action to avoid the accident. Therefore, Vehicle three cannot be considered primarily responsible for the crash.
