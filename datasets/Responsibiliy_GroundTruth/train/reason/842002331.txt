The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right pavement edge and entered a wooded area, subsequently colliding with roadside brush, a small diameter tree, a downed tree trunk, and finally a large diameter tree. These multiple collisions indicate that Vehicle 1 was not under proper control and failed to maintain its lane, resulting in the accident.
