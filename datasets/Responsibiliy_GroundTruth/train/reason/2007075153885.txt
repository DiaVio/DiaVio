The driver of V1 attempted to avoid a non-contact vehicle encroaching into their lane by moving slightly to the left. However, this evasive action resulted in V1 losing control and rotating counterclockwise, ultimately causing the vehicle to leave the roadway and collide with a delineator post and guardrail. The driver's incorrect evasive action, combined with the slick road surface and blowing snow, contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the fact that two of V1's tires were underinflated and had low tread depth would have further compromised the vehicle's handling capability on the slick roads. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and the vehicle's poor tire condition.
