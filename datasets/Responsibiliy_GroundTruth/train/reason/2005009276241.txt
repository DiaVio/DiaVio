The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 made an illegal maneuver by cutting across the path of Vehicle 2 while making a right turn. This action put Vehicle 2 at risk and resulted in a collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 fled the scene after the impact, which further demonstrates their responsibility for the accident.
