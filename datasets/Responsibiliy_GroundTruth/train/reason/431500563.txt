The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 lost traction on the wet road surface while negotiating a left curve, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and cross into the southbound lanes, directly into the path of Vehicles 3 and 1. This initial action by Vehicle 2 set off a chain of events that resulted in the subsequent impacts and damage to Vehicles 1 and 3.
