The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 128 kmph (80 mph) in a 48 kmph (30 mph) speed limit zone. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's decision error of slamming on the brakes in response to seeing a police car, led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The driver's inexperience, young age, and the presence of multiple passengers in the car may have also contributed to the driver's inability to handle the situation properly.
