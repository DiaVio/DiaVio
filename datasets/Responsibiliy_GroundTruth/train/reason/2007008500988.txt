The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding to turn left. The driver of V1 was distracted by talking to her mother and did not see V2 (the 2002 Toyota Corolla) approaching in the eastbound lane. Despite stopping at the stop sign, V1 pulled out in front of V2, resulting in the collision. Driver inexperience was also identified as an associated factor. It is important for drivers to remain focused and attentive while operating a vehicle, especially at intersections where multiple vehicles may be approaching from different directions. In this case, V1's failure to properly survey the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic led to the accident.
