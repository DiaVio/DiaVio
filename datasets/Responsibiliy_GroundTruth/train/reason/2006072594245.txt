The driver of V1 admitted to not wearing his corrective glasses for far-sightedness at the time of the crash, which could have impaired his vision and ability to accurately assess the distance and position of other vehicles on the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he saw V2 in his right side rearview mirror and believed he had enough distance to change lanes, but failed to adequately surveil the blind spot where V2 was located. This inadequate surveillance, combined with the fact that V1 struck the left side of V2 during the lane change, supports the conclusion that V1 was primarily responsible for the collision. It is important to note that the driver of V2 could not be located for an interview, so there may be additional factors or information that could potentially impact the determination of responsibility. However, based on the available information, V1's actions and failure to properly surveil the blind spot appear to be the main contributing factors to the accident.
