The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while waiting at the traffic signal, and subsequently woke up startled and hit the gas, causing the vehicle to veer right, strike the curb, and depart the roadway. Although there were reports of a medical condition that may have triggered the events, the presence of this condition could not be confirmed, and no medical records were obtained. Therefore, the primary cause of the crash is attributed to the driver's error of falling asleep and losing control of the vehicle.
