The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 apparently steered to the left in an extreme manner, possibly startled by a vehicle changing lanes on her right. This sudden and extreme steering maneuver caused V1 to begin a counter-clockwise yaw and ultimately resulted in the vehicle colliding with the guardrail. The impact with the guardrail further accelerated the counterclockwise rotation and caused V1 to overturn multiple times before coming to rest on its wheels. Therefore, the driver of V1's actions, specifically the extreme steering maneuver, led to the loss of control and subsequent rollover of the vehicle, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
