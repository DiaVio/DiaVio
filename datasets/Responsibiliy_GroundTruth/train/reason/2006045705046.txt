The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was temporarily blinded by sun glare and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. Additionally, the driver was fatigued and had not slept in over 27 hours, which likely contributed to his inattentiveness and failure to look far enough ahead. The dry rotted tires were not considered a contributing factor to the crash.
