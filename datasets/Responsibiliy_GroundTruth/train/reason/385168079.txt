The reason for assigning primary responsibility to Vehicle 1 is that it was the vehicle that was struck by Vehicle 2 in a "T-type" configuration. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was already in the intersection. Additionally, Vehicle 1 initiated a left steering maneuver, which caused it to rotate counterclockwise and ultimately roll over. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 may have made an unsafe maneuver, contributing to the crash. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the actions of the drivers involved, Vehicle 1 (the 2006 Ford F-150) is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
