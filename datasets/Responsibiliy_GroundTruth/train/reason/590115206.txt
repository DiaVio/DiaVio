The driver took her eyes off the road to reach for a cup of coffee, causing the vehicle to drift off the left roadside. When the driver steered the vehicle to the right to return to the roadway, she overcorrected and steered the vehicle to the left, resulting in a counterclockwise yaw and the vehicle sliding off the left roadside into the median. This sequence of events indicates that the driver's distraction and subsequent overcorrection were the main factors leading to the crash.
