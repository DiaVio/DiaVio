The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a right turn. This is evident from the Critical Reason coded for V2, which states "inadequate surveillance (failed to look)". The driver of V2 reported that she never saw V1 when she was turning right, indicating a lack of attention and awareness of other vehicles on the road. Additionally, the driver of V2 claimed to have had the green light, but the driver of V1 stated that V2 entered the intersection without stopping. This suggests that V2 may have disregarded the traffic signal, further supporting V2's responsibility for the accident. In summary, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and a potential violation of traffic signals.
