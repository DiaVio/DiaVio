The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is as follows: 1. V1 crossed the centerline and struck V2 head-on, indicating a clear violation of the traffic rules and failure to maintain their lane. 2. The driver of V1 was fatigued, having only 1 hour of sleep in the last 2 days. Fatigue can impair judgment, reaction time, and overall driving ability. 3. The driver of V1 was distracted by a phone call from her ex-boyfriend, which upset her and potentially diverted her attention from the road. 4. The presence of an open cell phone in the driver seat of V1 suggests that the driver may have been using the phone at the time of the crash, further contributing to distraction. It is important to note that V2 (the driver of the Buick Park Ave) did not exhibit any critical pre-crash events or reasons that would assign primary responsibility to them.
