The reason for this is that the driver allowed the vehicle to track off the roadway to the right and attempted to steer the vehicle across the depressed gore area and onto the adjacent entrance ramp. However, the vehicle climbed across the raised ramp and traveled off the opposite side, resulting in the vehicle overturning multiple times and causing severe damage. The driver's actions of veering off the roadway and failing to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately led to the accident.
