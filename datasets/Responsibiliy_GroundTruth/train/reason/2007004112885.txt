The reason for this is that V1 was driving at an excessive speed and made the decision to beat the amber light, accelerating through the intersection. This aggressive driving behavior led to V1 losing control of their vehicle and colliding with V2 and V3, who were waiting at a red light. Additionally, V1's incorrect evasive action of steering to the right without braking further contributed to the collision. The rush hour congestion and the presence of a non-contact vehicle making a left turn in front of V1 also played a role in the crash, but the primary responsibility lies with V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to maintain control of their vehicle.
