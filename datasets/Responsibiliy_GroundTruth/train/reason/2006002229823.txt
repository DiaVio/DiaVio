The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that the other vehicles were stopped in his lane and they should not have been. However, the critical precrash event for Vehicle #1 was coded as "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane, Other Vehicle Stopped" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "Driver Related Error, Decision Error, Inadequate Evasive Action." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #1 failed to take adequate evasive action to avoid the collision, even though the other vehicles were stopped in front of him. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error and inadequate evasive action.
