The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by her cell phone and stated that she "drifted into the oncoming lane." This indicates that she was not paying attention to the road and failed to maintain her lane, resulting in the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1998 Dodge Ram bus) was traveling within their lane and there is no information suggesting any fault on their part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors and internal distraction.
