The driver of Vehicle One swerved left to avoid contact with an unknown non-contact vehicle encroaching into their lane. However, the driver then overcompensated by swerving back right, causing them to lose control of the vehicle and ultimately collide with the Jersey Barrier. The driver's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control led to the crash, making Vehicle One primarily responsible.
