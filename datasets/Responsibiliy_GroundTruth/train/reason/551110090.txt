The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in lane 3, which indicates that it was in the middle lane of the roadway. V1, the 1998 Chevrolet Camaro, was turning left from a side street to go southbound. V2's front impacted the right side of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 while it was making a left turn. Additionally, V2's front impacted the right side of V1 again as it rotated off the roadway, suggesting that V2 was unable to stop or avoid the collision even after the initial impact. This further supports the conclusion that V2 was primarily responsible for the accident.
