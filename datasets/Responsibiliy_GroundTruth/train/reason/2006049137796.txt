The reason for this is that V1 was stopped in the driveway and then entered the roadway without adequately surveilling the traffic. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). This lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Intrepid) stated that he saw V1 but did not realize that V1 would enter the roadway until it was too late to avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and was not expecting V1 to enter the roadway in front of him. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately surveil the traffic and yield to oncoming vehicles.
