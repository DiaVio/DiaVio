The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was traveling in the opposite direction in the southbound lane and encroached into Vehicle #1's lane, causing Vehicle #1 to swerve to the right and ultimately crash. Vehicle #1's driver stated that she had to take evasive action to avoid a collision with Vehicle #2. Therefore, Vehicle #2's failure to stay in its own lane and driving into oncoming traffic is the main cause of the crash.
