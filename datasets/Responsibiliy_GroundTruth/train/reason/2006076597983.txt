The driver of V1 was distracted and took his eyes off the road while reaching for something to his right. This internal distraction caused him to lose control of the vehicle on the wet roadway, resulting in the fishtailing and ultimately running off the road. The driver's fatigue from a long journey and the emotional stress of attending his daughter's funeral likely contributed to his lack of focus and impaired driving ability.
