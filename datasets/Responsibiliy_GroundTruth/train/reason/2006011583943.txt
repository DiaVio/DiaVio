The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain a safe distance from the slowing traffic in lane 2 and was unable to stop in time. This led to V1 making abrupt steering maneuvers, first into lane 1 and then back into lane 2, in an attempt to avoid colliding with other vehicles. Ultimately, V1 exited the roadway and collided with the median wall. Factors that contributed to the cause of the crash include rush hour traffic congestion, the driver's failure to look far enough ahead, following too closely, and traveling at a speed that was too fast for the traffic conditions. These factors indicate that V1's actions and decisions were the primary cause of the accident.
