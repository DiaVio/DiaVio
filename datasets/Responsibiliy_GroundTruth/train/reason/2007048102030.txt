The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely for the congested traffic conditions and was unable to avoid colliding with the back of V2 when it decelerated. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a driver-related factor and a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction while decelerating," further supporting the fact that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 make them primarily responsible for the accident.
