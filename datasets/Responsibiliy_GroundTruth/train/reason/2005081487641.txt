The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 steered sharply to the left and braked, causing V1 to enter a counterclockwise yaw and ultimately collide with the concrete jersey barrier. The driver's incorrect evasive action, in this case, was steering left instead of right, which would have allowed V1 to come to a safe stop on the right shoulder of the exit ramp. The driver's overcompensation also contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and overcompensation.
