The driver of V1 was distracted by talking on a cell phone and reaching for a pencil to write down directions while driving. This distraction caused him to drift off the road multiple times before ultimately losing control of the vehicle and rolling over. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the roadway and some of his tires were worn, which may have contributed to the poor directional control. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was negligent and primarily responsible for the accident.
