The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Precrash Event coded to the driver of V1. This decision error of traveling too fast for the curve led to the loss of vehicle control, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the contributing factors of rush hour congestion, proceeding with insufficient clearance, and low tire pressure in three of the tires on V1 further support V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
