The driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which is a driver-related factor and a nonperformance error. This resulted in V1 veering off the right side of the road and ultimately colliding with a culvert and a utility pole. The driver's fatigue, possibly exacerbated by taking aspirin daily, contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
