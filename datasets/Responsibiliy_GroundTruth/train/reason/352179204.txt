The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted off the left edge of the roadway and traveled along the grass embankment, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver over-steered right, which caused the vehicle to enter a left side leading yaw and subsequently trip, leading to the rollover event. This suggests that the driver's actions contributed to the accident.
