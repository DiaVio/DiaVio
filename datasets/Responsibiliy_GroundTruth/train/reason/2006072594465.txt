The driver of V1 was inattentive while changing lanes and failed to adequately surveil the surrounding traffic before attempting to change lanes. This resulted in V1 striking the left side of V2 (the 2001 Ford Crown Victoria). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, and the critical reason for V1 was inadequate surveillance.
