The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, which indicates that it had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V2, the 1984 Toyota Camry, was traveling straight in its lane and had the right of way. The contact between the left side of V1 and the front of V2 suggests that V1 failed to yield and turned in front of V2, causing the collision.
