The reason for this is that V1 disregarded the traffic signal at the intersection, which is classified as an illegal maneuver. This disregard for the traffic signal led to the collision with V2 (the 1998 Ford Escort), causing V2 to rotate and subsequently collide with V3 (the 2004 Lexus SC430). Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal is the main factor that led to the accident.
