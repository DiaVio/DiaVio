The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection on the red phase of the traffic signal, indicating that they failed to stop or check for crossing traffic. The driver of V1, who had only been driving for two months and had no driver training, reported that they believed they had a green light and proceeded through the intersection without adequate surveillance. This indicates a lack of awareness and failure to properly assess the traffic situation, resulting in the collision.
