The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they had a red light but proceeded into the intersection regardless. Although the temporary replacement traffic light was difficult to see, V1 should have exercised caution and followed the traffic rules. The driver's statement that they thought the light was green indicates a decision error and a failure to determine the right-of-way properly. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and unfamiliarity with the roadway contribute to their responsibility for the accident.
