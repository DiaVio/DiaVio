The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This means that V1 failed to adequately observe the intersection and failed to see V2 before the collision occurred. Additionally, the vision restriction caused by the building was an associated factor in this crash, further contributing to V1's failure to see V2 in time to avoid the crash.
