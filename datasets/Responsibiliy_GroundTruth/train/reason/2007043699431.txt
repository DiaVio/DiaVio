The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 crossed the centerline and impacted Vehicle 2, causing the initial collision. The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to going around a curve as another vehicle passed, thinking he was clear, but ended up hitting Vehicle 2. The driver of Vehicle 1 also mentioned poor directional control, which indicates a driver-related factor. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated the travel and impact speeds of Vehicle 1 to be 74 kmph (46 mph), which suggests that Vehicle 1 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph). Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to crossing the centerline and causing the initial collision with Vehicle 2.
