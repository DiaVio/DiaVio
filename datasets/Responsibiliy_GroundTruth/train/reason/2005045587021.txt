The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle one (the 1996 Dodge Intrepid) while attempting to turn left from a private drive onto the four-lane road. The driver of Vehicle two admitted to not seeing Vehicle one before making the turn, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle two was distracted by a phone call, further contributing to the failure to notice the oncoming Vehicle one. Therefore, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield, lack of observation, and distraction while driving.
