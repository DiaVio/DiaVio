The reason for this is that the driver of V2 experienced a blackout and did not see V1 prior to the crash. This indicates a physical impairment of the ability to act, specifically a possible heart attack or other physical condition that affected the driver's awareness and perception. As a result, V2 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the back of V1.
