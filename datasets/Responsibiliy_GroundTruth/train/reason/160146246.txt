The reason for this is that V1, for unknown reasons, entered the westbound lanes of the roadway, which is a violation of traffic rules. Additionally, the driver of V1 attempted to steer right to correct the situation but ended up driving off the roadway on the right side, resulting in a clockwise yaw. This indicates a loss of control of the vehicle by the driver. Furthermore, V1 drove over the edge of a steep embankment and struck a tree with its left side, followed by rolling over and striking another tree with its left front. These actions suggest that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and made errors in judgment while attempting to correct the situation. Overall, the primary responsibility for the rollover crash lies with the driver of V1 due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle and their violation of traffic rules by entering the wrong lanes of the roadway.
