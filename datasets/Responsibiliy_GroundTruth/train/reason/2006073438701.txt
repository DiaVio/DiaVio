The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver falsely assumed that V2 (the driver of the 1990 Ford E-100 Conversion Van) would yield the right of way to the emergency vehicle. This false assumption led to V1 proceeding through the intersection at a high rate of speed without ensuring that it was safe to do so. As a result, V1 collided with the right side of V2, causing the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their false assumption of the other driver's actions.
