The driver of V1 admitted to police and EMS that she had been drinking and had smoked crack earlier in the evening. She also claimed to have been attempting suicide. Medical records showed cocaine in her system and a blood alcohol level of 0.217 less than 1 hour after the crash. Emotional factors were also present, as she had just had an argument with her ex-husband over custody of their children. Additionally, poor directional control was the only other associated factor coded. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was impaired and emotionally unstable, leading to her departure from the road and subsequent collision with a utility pole.
