The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the left in the curve, crossed over both southbound lanes, and departed the roadway to the left. V1 then had multiple impacts with various objects, including the end of the guard rail, shrubs, a tree that slapped down and impacted the roof, and a large fallen tree trunk. These actions indicate that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the accident.
