The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a critical pre-crash event. The critical reason for this event was a recognition error, as it is unknown whether V1 saw V2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier) or not. Additionally, the driver of V1 was a 16-year old female with limited driving experience, which could have contributed to the recognition error. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was not thought to have contributed to the crash and reported traveling at a reasonable speed prior to the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
