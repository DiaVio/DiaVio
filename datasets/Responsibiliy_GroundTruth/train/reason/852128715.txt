The reason for this is that V1 entered into the opposite lane, which is a violation of traffic laws and a dangerous maneuver. This action resulted in the collision with vehicle two (V2), the 2005 Chevrolet Silverado pickup. V2, on the other hand, began to move to the right partially on the west paved shoulder, likely in an attempt to avoid the oncoming V1. Therefore, V1's decision to enter the opposite lane and cause the collision makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
