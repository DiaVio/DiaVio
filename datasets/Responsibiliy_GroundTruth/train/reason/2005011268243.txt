Reason: V1 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the snowy and icy road conditions. The driver did not recognize the need to slow down as soon as it began to snow, indicating a decision error. Additionally, the poor condition of the tires and the placement of sandbags in the bed of the truck may have contributed to the loss of control. The driver's lack of recent experience on the road may have also played a role. Overall, V1's failure to adjust speed and take necessary precautions for the weather conditions led to the crash.
