The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, who was traveling straight in the southbound lane. V2 falsely assumed that V1 would yield to her vehicle, which resulted in V1's motorcycle colliding with the left front side of V2's car.
