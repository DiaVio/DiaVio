The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to the slippery road surface while overtaking another vehicle. This loss of control resulted in V1 departing the road and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the case occupant.
