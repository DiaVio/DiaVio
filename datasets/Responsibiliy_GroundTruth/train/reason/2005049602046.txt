The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and veered off the road to the right side before reaching the exit ramp. The driver reported no avoidance action, indicating a lack of effort to regain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was traveling over the posted speed limit and did not have a driver's license or any driver training. The physical evidence also supports the driver's lack of control, as the vehicle impacted crash barrels and a steel cable before coming to rest off the road. The inspection of the tires showed no damage or abnormal wear, and the driver's claim of an unknown problem with the tires is not substantiated. Overall, the driver's poor directional control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
