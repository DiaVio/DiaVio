The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was coded as "asleep" during the critical pre-crash event. The driver indicated to medical personnel that she thought she had passed out at the wheel, and she had a history of falling asleep while driving, as evidenced by a previous crash two years prior. Additionally, the driver's medical history revealed that she was on several medications, including tranquilizers, opiates, and sleep-aid drugs, and she suffered from sleep apnea. Both the usage of prescription medications and the medical condition of sleep apnea were coded as associated factors. Therefore, the driver's impaired state due to falling asleep at the wheel, combined with the influence of medications and the medical condition of sleep apnea, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
