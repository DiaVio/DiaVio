The driver of Vehicle #2 admitted to making a left turn onto the two lane undivided roadway after stopping at a stop sign for 1-2 seconds. However, the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #1 (the Toyota Sienna) and thought there was enough time to pull out safely. Additionally, the driver mentioned that their left front window was fogged over, which impaired their visibility of Vehicle #1. Therefore, Vehicle #2's driver's decision error and misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, along with impaired visibility, led to the collision.
