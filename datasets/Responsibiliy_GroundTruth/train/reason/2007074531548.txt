The driver of V1 admitted to not taking his prescribed medication for epilepsy as directed, which could have contributed to his seizure and subsequent loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, he mentioned feeling fatigued and hungover from drinking the night before, which likely impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. These factors, combined with his statement of "drifting" prior to blacking out, suggest that his physical impairment and failure to take necessary precautions were the main causes of the accident.
