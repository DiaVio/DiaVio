The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway on the right side and struck a tree, indicating a lack of proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the police reported that the subject was cited for public intoxication, suggesting that the driver may have been impaired at the time of the collision. Although the researcher was unable to definitively conclude if there were any other factors that contributed to the critical event, the poor directional control mentioned is an associative factor that further supports V1's responsibility.
