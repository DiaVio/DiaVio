The driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which is a critical non-performance driver-related factor. This resulted in V1 crossing the centerline and colliding with V2 (the 2000 Ford Taurus SEL). Although V2's driver attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering onto the shoulder, they were unable to prevent the accident due to V1's actions. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control of their vehicle and stay within their lane makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
