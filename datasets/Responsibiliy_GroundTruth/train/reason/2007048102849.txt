The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." V2 (the driver of the 1999 Chevrolet Tahoe) saw V1 but did not anticipate that V1 would turn in front of him. This indicates that V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
