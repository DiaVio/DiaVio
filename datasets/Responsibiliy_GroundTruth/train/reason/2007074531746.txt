The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to accurately judge the gap or the speed of V2 (the 2006 Hyundai Sonata). V1 stated that she saw V2 but believed she had enough time to make the turn. However, V2 was approaching from the opposite direction and had the right of way. V1's misjudgment of the gap and V2's speed led to the collision. Additionally, V1's distraction of talking to her passenger and looking left instead of focusing on the oncoming traffic further contributed to her failure to yield the right of way to V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her misjudgment and failure to yield the right of way.
