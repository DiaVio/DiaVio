The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver entered the intersection on a solid red light. This indicates that V1 failed to obey the traffic signal and proceeded through the intersection when it was not their right of way. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to "zoning out" and not seeing the light turn red, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving. While V2 (the 2002 Toyota Avalon) was making a left turn at the intersection, the driver of V2 had the right of way as they were turning on a green light. However, V1's failure to stop at the red light resulted in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to obey the traffic signal and their lack of attention while driving.
