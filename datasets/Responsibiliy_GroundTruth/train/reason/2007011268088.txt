The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The driver stated that he was traveling at a speed of 40-45 mph in an area with a posted speed limit of 45 mph and an advisory/caution limit of 35 mph. Additionally, the driver overcompensated after swerving to avoid a deer, causing the vehicle to lose control and cross the centerline. The contributing factors of wet road, dark and unlighted conditions, and the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway also played a role in the crash.
