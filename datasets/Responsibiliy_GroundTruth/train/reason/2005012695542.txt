The reason for this is that V1 made a decision error by falsely assuming that V2 (the driver of the 2002 Chevrolet Cavalier) would merge without stopping. This false assumption led to V1 not maintaining a safe distance and ultimately resulted in the front of V1 contacting the back of V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was focused on extraneous vehicles to her left and it was her first time driving on this roadway. These factors, combined with the traffic flow interruption due to the construction work zone, contributed to her decision error. On the other hand, V2 was waiting at the bottom of the ramp for a break in traffic to merge and was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
