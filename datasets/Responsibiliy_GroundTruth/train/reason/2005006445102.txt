The driver of V2 made a decision error by misjudging the gap or the speed of V1 while attempting to turn left at the intersection. V2 entered the roadway from a parking lot and crossed the path of V1, resulting in a collision. Although V1 was traveling at a moderate speed and tried to avoid the collision, the driver of V2 failed to yield the right of way and caused the accident.
