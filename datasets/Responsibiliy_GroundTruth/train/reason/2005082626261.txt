The reason for this is that V1 was weaving through traffic and failed to stop at a red light, despite the passenger's statement that the driver yelled out "I can't stop, I have no brakes!" It was confirmed by a police brake expert that there was no brake failure. Additionally, the driver of V1 had a paralyzed right leg and was driving with his left foot, which was a factor in his poor directional control and ability to control the vehicle.
