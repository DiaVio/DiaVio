The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection. The driver stated that she did not see the stop sign as it was completely covered by tree leaves and branches. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to be aware of traffic control devices and to ensure safe passage through intersections. The driver's inattention and failure to stop, even though she slightly reduced her speed, contributed to the collision with V2. As for V2 (the Honda Pilot), no associated factors or critical reasons could be determined due to the lack of information and the driver's unavailability for an interview. Therefore, V2's responsibility cannot be established based on the given information.
