The driver of V1 admitted to not checking the traffic properly before starting his left turn. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. The driver of V1 failed to exercise caution and ensure that it was safe to proceed with the left turn, even though another vehicle had stopped and waved him through. This failure to properly assess the situation and check for oncoming traffic led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (V2). Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
