The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that he never saw V2 approaching the intersection when he made his left turn. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to properly observe and assess the traffic conditions before executing the left turn. Additionally, the rainy weather and wet roadway may have contributed to reduced visibility and traction, making it even more crucial for V1 to exercise caution and ensure a safe turn.
