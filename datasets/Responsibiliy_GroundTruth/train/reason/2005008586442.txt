The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to being distracted, glancing to the right for an unknown reason, which caused her to not notice the stopped traffic in front of her. As a result, Vehicle 1 collided with the back of Vehicle 2 (2000 Audi A6), which was then pushed forward into Vehicle 3 (2005 Chrysler 300). The driver of Vehicle 2 refused to be interviewed, so their role in the accident cannot be determined. However, since the critical reason for the precrash event was attributed to Vehicle 1's external distraction, it indicates that Vehicle 1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
