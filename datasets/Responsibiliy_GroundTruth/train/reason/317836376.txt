The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to V2 (the 2008 Buick Enclave) and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a rear-end collision. The driver of V1 noticed V2 slowing down but was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a proper following distance and was unable to react in a timely manner to the changing traffic conditions.
