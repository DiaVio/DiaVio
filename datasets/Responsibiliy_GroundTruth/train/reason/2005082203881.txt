The reason for this is that V1 was making a left-hand turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically V2. V1's driver stated that she did not see V2 until she was well into her turn, indicating a failure to properly observe and assess the traffic situation before initiating the turn. Additionally, V1's driver speculated that the presence of another left-turning vehicle obstructed her view of V2, suggesting a lack of caution and awareness while making the turn.
