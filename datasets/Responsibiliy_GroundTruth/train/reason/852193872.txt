The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it drove off the roadway to the right, crossed the paved shoulder, and began to swerve left, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise on the soft gravel. V1 then returned to the roadway, but the driver's braking and swerving actions caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise and slide laterally, resulting in the rollover. The driver's loss of control and failure to maintain the vehicle on the roadway ultimately led to the crash.
