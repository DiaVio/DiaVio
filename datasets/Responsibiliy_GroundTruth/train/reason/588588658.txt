The driver of Vehicle 1 may have drifted off the roadway and then attempted to steer back onto the road, but ultimately departed the west edge of the roadway and collided with a mailbox post and a large tree. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper control, resulting in the accident.
