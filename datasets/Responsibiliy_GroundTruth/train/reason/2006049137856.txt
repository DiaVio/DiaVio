The driver of V1 initiated a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. They did not see V2 (the driver of the Dodge Caravan) prior to impact and made no attempt to avoid the collision. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
