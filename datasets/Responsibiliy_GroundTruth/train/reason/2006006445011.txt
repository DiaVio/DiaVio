The driver of V1 admitted to taking his eyes off the road and being distracted by a fight happening on the sidewalk. He also stated that he was not aware of the traffic light ahead. This indicates that the driver was not paying attention to the road and failed to anticipate the traffic situation. Additionally, the driver's brakes locked up and he skidded into the rear of V2, indicating a lack of control and proper braking technique. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors such as distraction, inadequate surveillance, and being unfamiliar with the roadway.
