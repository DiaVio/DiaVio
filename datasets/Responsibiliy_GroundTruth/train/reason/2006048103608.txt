The driver of V1 admitted to traveling above the posted speed limit, with the police-reported travel speed being 121 kmph (75 mph) in a 113 kmph (70 mph) zone. Additionally, the driver stated that he attempted to avoid a non-contact vehicle by steering off the road to the left, but lost control when trying to re-enter the roadway. This indicates that the driver's actions, including overcompensation, contributed to the crash. Furthermore, the underinflated tires on V1 were considered an associative factor. The measured tire pressures after the collision were significantly lower than the recommended tire pressure, which could have affected the vehicle's handling and stability. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, overcompensation, and the presence of underinflated tires.
