The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop and struck the back of V2 (the 1997 Honda Civic), which was stopped in lane one. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance or paying attention to the road ahead. As a result of the impact, V2 was pushed into V3 (the 2000 Chevrolet Suburban), causing further damage. Since V1 was the vehicle that initiated the collision by failing to stop, they bear the primary responsibility for the accident.
