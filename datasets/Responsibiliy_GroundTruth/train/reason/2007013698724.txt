The driver of V1 stated that she was familiar with the roadway but was unable to slow down when approaching the curve. She mentioned that her brakes locked up and did not slow the car down. Additionally, she mentioned that the tires were very low on tread depth and her ABS had not worked for about a year. The critical pre-crash event coded for V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related, too fast for curve/turn." The police report also states that the tires had very little tread and the ABS brakes did not work, as evidenced by long skid marks on the pavement. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed for the curve, the low tread depth of the tires, and the malfunctioning ABS brakes.
