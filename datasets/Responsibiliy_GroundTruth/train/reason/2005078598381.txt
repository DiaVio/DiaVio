The driver of V1 was traveling southbound and disregarded the traffic signal, which is classified as an illegal maneuver. This means that V1 failed to stop at the red light and entered the intersection when it was not their right of way. As a result, V2 (the 2000 Hyundai Elantra) entered the intersection on a green light and collided with the right side of V1. V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's disregard of the traffic signal and failure to yield to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
