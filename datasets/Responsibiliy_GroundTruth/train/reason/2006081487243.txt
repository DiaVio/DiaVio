The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver was running late for a doctor's appointment, it was raining heavily, and there was standing water on the roadway. When the vehicles in front of V1 braked for an unknown reason, the driver braked and steered left, but lost control of the vehicle and hydroplaned, ultimately resulting in the collision.
