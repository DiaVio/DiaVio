The reason for this is that V1 failed to negotiate the curve in the roadway and continued straight, crossing over the westbound lanes and departing the roadway. V1 then collided with a tree log and subsequently struck a large tree. The fact that V1's hood only suffered minor damage despite significant crush at the bumper corner suggests that the hood may have flipped up during the impact or when it ran over the tree log. This indicates that V1 was not under proper control and may have been traveling at an excessive speed or not paying attention to the road conditions. Additionally, the front right passenger in V1 was not wearing a seatbelt, which contributed to their serious injuries.
