The driver of V1 was underage, unlicensed, and under the influence of drugs (marijuana laced with cocaine) at the time of the collision. Additionally, the driver was driving without permission, fleeing the scene, and admitted to being disoriented. These factors indicate a clear disregard for traffic laws and safety, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
