The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it departed the roadway and impacted the embankment, leading to the rollover event and subsequent collision with the jersey barrier. V1's departure from the roadway indicates a failure to maintain control and stay within the designated travel lanes. Additionally, the fact that V1's undercarriage impacted the embankment suggests that the driver may have been traveling at an excessive speed or failed to negotiate the curve properly. Furthermore, the deployment of V1's frontal airbags indicates a significant impact, which further supports the notion that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
