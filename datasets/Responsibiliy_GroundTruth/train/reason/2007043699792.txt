The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. - The driver of V1 was distracted and talking to her children in the rear seat, which contributed to her inability to react and avoid the parked vehicle. - The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 72 kmph (45 mph), which suggests that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed for the road conditions. - Additionally, the Buick LeSabre driven by V1 had inadequate tread depth on the RF and RR tires, which may have further compromised the vehicle's ability to maintain control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, failure to maintain control, excessive speed, and inadequate tire condition.
