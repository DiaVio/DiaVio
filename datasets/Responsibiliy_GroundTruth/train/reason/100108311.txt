The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was not wearing a seatbelt, which is a violation of traffic laws and a contributing factor to the severity of the injuries sustained in the crash. Additionally, the driver's actions of accelerating the vehicle and veering to the left in a long straight trajectory, ultimately leading to the collision with the concrete block wall, indicate a lack of control and negligence on the part of the driver.
