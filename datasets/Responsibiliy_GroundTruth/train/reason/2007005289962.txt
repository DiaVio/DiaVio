The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that V2 had come to a complete stop for the traffic signal, indicating that V2 was following the rules of the road and obeying the traffic laws. V1, on the other hand, failed to recognize that V2 had stopped and subsequently struck the rear of V2. This indicates that V1 was not paying attention or failed to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them, leading to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 claimed that she had been stopped at the red light for a minute or more before the collision occurred. This suggests that V2 had been stationary for a significant amount of time, giving V1 ample opportunity to notice and react to the stopped vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to V1's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle and maintain a safe distance.
