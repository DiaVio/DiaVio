The reason for this is that V2 was traveling east on the eastbound roadway and was intending to go straight through the intersection. The frontal plane of V2 impacted the left side plane of V1, causing V1 to be pushed right laterally with less than 30 degrees of rotation before coming to a final rest at the intersection facing northwest. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, resulting in the collision.
