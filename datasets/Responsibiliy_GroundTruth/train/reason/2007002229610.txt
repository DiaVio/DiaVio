The driver of Vehicle #1 went off the road to the left, over-corrected, and then went off the roadway to the left again, resulting in the vehicle rolling over. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling, Off the Roadway to the left" and the critical reason for this event was "Driver Related Factor, Overcompensation." Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being tired prior to the start of the drive and personnel at the scene reported smelling an overpowering odor of liquor on the driver. The driver was tested for ethanol content at the hospital and had a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.218, well above the legal limit. Therefore, based on the driver's overcompensation, admission of tiredness, and high BAC, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
