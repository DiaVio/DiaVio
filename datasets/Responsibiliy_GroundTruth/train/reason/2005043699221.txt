The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a decision error by turning left on a late yellow turn signal. This indicates that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2 (the Toyota Echo) and thought they could safely make it through the intersection. The driver's assumption was false, resulting in the collision with Vehicle #2. It is important to note that Vehicle #2's driver was not cooperative and declined to be interviewed, so no critical reason or associated factors could be determined for their involvement in the accident.
