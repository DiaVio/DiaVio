The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control on the wet road and began to enter the right westbound lane while rotating in a counterclockwise manner. This indicates that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle, resulting in their entry into the right westbound lane and the subsequent collision with Vehicle two (V2).
