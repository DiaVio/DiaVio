The driver of V1 made a false assumption of the actions of the vehicles in front of her, thinking they were moving when they were actually stopped. This misjudgment led to V1 striking the rear of V2 (2005 Ford Focus SE 4 door), which then caused a chain reaction involving V3 (2000 Toyota Camry) and V4 (unknown year, make van). V2, on the other hand, stopped behind V3 and attempted to avoid the crash by accelerating and steering to the left. Therefore, V1's false assumption and subsequent collision make them primarily responsible for the accident.
