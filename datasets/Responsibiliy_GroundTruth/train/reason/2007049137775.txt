The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn in the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the Jeep Cherokee) was traveling straight in the northbound lane and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and turned in front of V2, resulting in the collision.
