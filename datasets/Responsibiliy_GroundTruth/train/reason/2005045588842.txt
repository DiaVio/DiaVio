The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle #2 (the GMC Envoy) when traffic came to a sudden stop. Vehicle #1 left skid marks prior to impact, indicating that the driver was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for Vehicle #1 was a decision error, specifically driving too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver failed to look far enough ahead and made the false assumption that the other driver would continue to proceed. These factors contribute to the driver's responsibility for the accident. It is important to note that the construction work zone was included as a traffic interruption factor for both vehicles, but Vehicle #1's failure to stop in time and rear-end Vehicle #2 indicates a greater level of responsibility.
