The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a non-contact vehicle attempting to pass on his left. This distraction caused him to lose control of his vehicle and ultimately collide with V2, V3, and V4. The driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to look far enough ahead also contributed to the accident.
