The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep, relinquished control of the vehicle, and drifted to the right. This resulted in V1 departing from its lane and colliding with the left-rear corner of V2's trailer. The fact that V1 drove past/through the impact and came to rest on the right shoulder indicates that V1 was the vehicle that initiated the collision.
