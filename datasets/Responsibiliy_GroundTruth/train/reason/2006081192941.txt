The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that an unknown vehicle cut in front of him and applied the brakes, causing him to swerve and jump the curb. However, the driver's overcompensation and poor directional control ultimately led to the vehicle leaving the roadway, striking the embankment, and flipping onto its left side. Additionally, the driver only had one year of driving experience and was approaching a congested area with warning signs and slowing traffic ahead.
