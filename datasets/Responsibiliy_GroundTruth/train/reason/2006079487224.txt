The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, which resulted in the collision with V1. Although V1's critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as a driver-related factor ("false assumption of other's actions"), it is important to note that V1 was in the left turn lane and had the right of way to make the left turn. V2's encroachment into the left turn lane caused the collision, making V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
