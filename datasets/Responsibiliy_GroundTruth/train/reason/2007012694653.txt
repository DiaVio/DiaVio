The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to adjusting her seatbelt while driving, which is a form of internal distraction and a driver-related factor. This distraction likely contributed to her loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's actions of unbuckling her seatbelt while the vehicle was in motion and her reported discomfort with the vehicle's seat belt system indicate a lack of proper attention to safety measures. Furthermore, the driver's statement that she hit some ice or a slick spot on the roadway, causing her to lose control, suggests that she was not exercising appropriate caution for the road conditions. It is the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior to match the prevailing weather and road conditions. Lastly, the driver's history of seizure activity and medication for it, although not directly related to the crash, may raise concerns about her fitness to drive and potential underlying health issues that could have contributed to the crash. Overall, the driver's actions, distractions, failure to maintain control, and potential health-related factors make V1 and its driver primarily responsible for the crash.
