The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was in the right, southbound through lane and intended to cross through the intersection. However, the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to successfully avoid the collision, despite braking prior to impact. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was in the dedicated left-turn lane of the northbound roadway and had the right of way to turn left at the intersection.
