The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to stop behind V2 (the Chevrolet Silverado) at the stop sign, resulting in the front of V1 striking the back of V2. Additionally, it is mentioned in the police report that the driver of V1 was legally intoxicated, which indicates impaired judgment and potentially contributed to their failure to stop. Therefore, V1's failure to stop and their intoxicated state make them primarily responsible for the accident.
