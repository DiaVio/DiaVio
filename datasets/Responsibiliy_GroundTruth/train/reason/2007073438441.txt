The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane" and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; incorrect evasive action." This indicates that V1 crossed over into the northbound lanes, which ultimately led to the collision with V2. While it is mentioned that the sightline restriction caused by the non-contact vehicles and the slush-covered roadway were associated factors in the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not maintaining their lane and taking incorrect evasive action.
