The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that it swerved to the right to avoid a slower-moving vehicle, resulting in a sideswipe impact with a guardrail on the right side. This initial maneuver by V1 indicates a failure to maintain control and avoid a collision, leading to the subsequent impact with another guardrail on the front end. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of the injuries sustained. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the resulting sequence of events, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
