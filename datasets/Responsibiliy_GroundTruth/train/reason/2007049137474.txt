The driver of V1 admitted to not looking far enough ahead and assuming that V2 (the 1986 Oldsmobile Cutlass) would continue forward. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to maintain proper surveillance and anticipate the actions of the vehicles ahead. By not paying attention to the road ahead and failing to maintain a safe following distance, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2. This initial impact then caused V2 to collide with the rear of V3 (the 1994 Cadillac DeVille). Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to maintain a safe following distance are the primary reasons for the accident.
