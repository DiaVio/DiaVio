The reason for this is that V1 was traveling southbound and crossed three travel lanes and the right southbound shoulder before departing the roadway. V1 then collided with a breakaway light pole and a sign pole before coming to a stop facing east. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining control of the vehicle and veered off the road, causing the multiple collisions.
