The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the curve/turn, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. - V1 failed to obey the stop sign at the intersection, indicating a failure to follow traffic control devices. - The driver of V1 was distracted by a personal problem, which likely affected their ability to focus on the road and make appropriate driving decisions. - The witness statement that there was no vehicle pursuing V1 contradicts the driver's claim, suggesting that the driver's perception of being pursued may have been a contributing factor to the crash. Overall, V1's excessive speed, failure to obey traffic control devices, distracted driving, and poor directional control all point to their primary responsibility for the crash.
