The driver of V1 admitted to being on a cell phone while stopped at the stop sign, indicating a distraction. Additionally, the driver stated that they thought they looked both ways but failed to see V2 approaching. This suggests inadequate surveillance and a failure to properly check for oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper caution and adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn led to the collision with V2.
