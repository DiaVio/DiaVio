The driver of V2 admitted to following too closely and was unable to respond to the sudden braking of the vehicles in front of him. This resulted in V2 colliding with the rear of V1, initiating the chain of events that led to the subsequent collisions. The driver of V2 also mentioned that he was more concerned about being struck by V3 from behind, indicating that he was not fully focused on the road ahead. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain a safe following distance and lack of attention to the road make them primarily responsible for the accident.
