The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by attempting to pass a non-contact vehicle in a no passing zone. This decision placed V1 in the path of V2 (the 2003 Dodge Ram pickup) and ultimately resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the fact that the driver of V1 had a blood alcohol test result of 0.225 indicates that alcohol consumption was a factor in her decision-making process. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
