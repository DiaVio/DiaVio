The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it crossed the centerline while traveling in a curve, resulting in a collision with Vehicle Two (V2), the 1989 Ford F350 truck. This initial impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and enter the eastbound lane, where it was subsequently struck by Vehicle Three (V3), the 1998 Oldsmobile 88 sedan. V1's failure to maintain its lane and cross the centerline directly led to the collision with V2 and subsequent impacts with V3. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
