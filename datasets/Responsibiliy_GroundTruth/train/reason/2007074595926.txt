The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 (the 2007 Chevrolet Suburban) while V2 was decelerating for the upcoming stop sign. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to smoking marijuana and not remembering anything about the crash. This suggests that the driver may have been impaired at the time of the accident, further contributing to their responsibility. Overall, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and potential impairment due to drug use make them primarily responsible for the accident.
