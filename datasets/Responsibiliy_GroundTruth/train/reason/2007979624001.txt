The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 did not check for oncoming traffic because the traffic light had turned red. This indicates a disregard for the traffic control signal. Additionally, the driver of V1 has a medical condition (hypertension and prone to seizures) that may have impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and disregard for the traffic control signal makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
