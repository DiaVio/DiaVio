The reason for this is that V1, the Chevy Camaro, was driven by a 41-year old male who experienced a seizure while driving. The driver reported that he blacked out and did not recall striking the pole. The critical reason for the crash was coded as a driver-related physical impairment due to the seizure. Additionally, the driver's actions at the scene, such as appearing glassy-eyed and dazed, were consistent with the influence of narcotics or a seizure. Although the driver had preexisting health conditions and was taking medication, the seizure was the immediate cause of the crash.
