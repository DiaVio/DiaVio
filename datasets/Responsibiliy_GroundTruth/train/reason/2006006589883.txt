The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make an illegal U-turn on a roadway with a hillcrest, which obstructed her view of oncoming traffic. Despite looking both ways, V2 failed to see V1 approaching from the southbound direction. This decision error and illegal maneuver by V2 led to the collision with V1. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 was unfamiliar with the roadway, further contributing to the inexperience and lack of awareness of the potential dangers associated with making a U-turn in that specific location.
