The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by traveling too fast for the curve. This decision error led to the vehicle edging off the right side of the road, striking the concrete curb and guardrail, and ultimately losing control and colliding with a tree. The driver's inexperience, as indicated by being a 17-year-old with a part-time job, may have contributed to the decision error.
