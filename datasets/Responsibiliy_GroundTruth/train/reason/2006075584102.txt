The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was going straight through the intersection while Vehicle 1 (2003 Nissan Pathfinder) was making a left turn. Vehicle 2 attempted to avoid the crash by swerving right and locking up the brakes, but still ended up colliding with the right rear of Vehicle 1. Since Vehicle 2 was going straight and had the right of way, it was the responsibility of Vehicle 1 to yield and ensure that it was safe to make the left turn. Therefore, Vehicle 1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that the driver of Vehicle 2 was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and she had been driving on this road daily and felt comfortable with the vehicle and passenger. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle 1 was reported to have a smell of alcohol on her breath, although subsequent tests were negative. However, her refusal to cooperate and provide information further raises concerns about her level of responsibility in the accident. In summary, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident as it was proceeding straight through the intersection while Vehicle 1 failed to yield and made a left turn.
