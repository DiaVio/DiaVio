The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 suffered a medical emergency, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle and cross over into the oncoming lanes of travel. This resulted in the collision with Vehicle 1 (the 2014 Nissan Versa) as it was turning right into the westbound lane that Vehicle 2 was entering. The actions of the driver of Vehicle 2, due to the medical emergency, initiated the sequence of events leading to the accident.
