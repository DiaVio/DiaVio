The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being asleep at the time of the crash. This indicates a clear driver-related factor that contributed to the accident. As a result of being asleep, the driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 was stopped in front of them, leading to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was stopped with their left turn signal on for at least fifteen seconds prior to the crash, indicating that they were following proper traffic rules and signals. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's negligence in falling asleep while driving.
