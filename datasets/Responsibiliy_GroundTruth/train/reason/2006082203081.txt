The reason for this is because the driver of vehicle one was under the influence of alcohol and in possession of an unknown illicit drug. This impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely and make appropriate decisions on the road. Additionally, vehicle one was turning left at the intersection against a red arrow, indicating that it was not their right of way. This failure to obey traffic signals and the driver's impaired state contributed to the collision with vehicle two.
