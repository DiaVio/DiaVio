The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. The driver stated that he was not expecting a stopped vehicle in his lane and lost control while trying to avoid it. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V1's travel speed to be 75 mph, which is higher than the posted speed limit of 65 mph. This indicates that V1 was exceeding the speed limit, further contributing to the driver's inability to respond effectively to the situation. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and failure to anticipate and react to the presence of the stopped vehicle make them primarily responsible for the crash.
