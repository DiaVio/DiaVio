The driver of V1 admitted that she looked but did not see any vehicles approaching before making her left turn. This indicates inadequate surveillance on her part. Additionally, the driver was taking a prescribed medication for a pre-existing health condition, which could have potentially affected her ability to properly assess the situation. The wet roads were also considered an associated factor, although it is unclear whether it was actually raining at the time of the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and potential impairment from medication.
