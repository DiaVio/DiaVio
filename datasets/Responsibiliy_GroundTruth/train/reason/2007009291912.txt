The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver stated that she experienced a brake failure while approaching a left curve with a downhill slope. Despite attempting to slow down the vehicle, the brake pedal went to the floor without resistance, causing V1 to pick up speed. The driver's attempts to stop the car using the hand brake, turning off the ignition, and jamming the vehicle into park were unsuccessful and resulted in the steering wheel locking. As a result, V1 veered off the road and crashed into a tree. While it is mentioned that the brakes were replaced two months prior to the crash, the possibility of brake failure cannot be ruled out. The absence of skid marks at the scene and the presence of a liquid trail leading to the final rest also suggest that the brakes may have failed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the brake failure and the subsequent inability to control the vehicle.
