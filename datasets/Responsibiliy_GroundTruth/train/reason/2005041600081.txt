The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was driving at an excessively high rate of speed, changing lanes rapidly, and weaving in and out of traffic. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with traveling too fast for the conditions, led to V1 losing control and colliding with the back of V2 (the Ford F-350).
