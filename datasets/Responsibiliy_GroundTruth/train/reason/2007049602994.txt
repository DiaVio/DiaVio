The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated after an unidentified vehicle allegedly cut into his lane. This overcompensation caused V1 to drive off the road to the right, striking a guardrail and a concrete barrier. V1 then crossed all three lanes of travel and struck the concrete median barrier before coming to rest. While the presence of the unidentified vehicle may have contributed to the driver's initial reaction, it was ultimately the driver's overcompensation that led to the crash.
