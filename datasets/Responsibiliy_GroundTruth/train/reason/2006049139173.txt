The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she attempted to merge into the first lane of travel without properly checking her blind spot and failed to notice the non-contact vehicle occupying that lane. When she realized there was another vehicle in the intended lane, she panicked and overcompensated by steering hard to the left, resulting in a loss of control of her vehicle. This overcompensation and loss of control ultimately led to V1 crossing multiple lanes of travel, driving over the raised curbed cement median, and departing the roadway, causing damage to her vehicle. Therefore, V1's failure to properly check her blind spot, overcompensation, and subsequent loss of control make her primarily responsible for the crash.
