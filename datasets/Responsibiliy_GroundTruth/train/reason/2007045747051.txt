The reason for this is that V1 veered suddenly to the right for no apparent reason, crossed multiple lanes of traffic, and drove off the right edge of the road. The driver's behavior, including being under the influence of intoxicants and being upset about a recent breakup, may have contributed to her unknown performance error and departure from the road. Additionally, the presence of alcohol and the observed argument prior to the crash suggest that the driver's physical condition, recognition, and behavior were factors in the crash.
