The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the Toyota Rav-4) who was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's view of V2 was obstructed by the non-contact vehicle in lane two, but it is still the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to ensure that it is safe to do so. V2 had the right of way and attempted to brake and avoid the collision, but was unsuccessful in doing so.
