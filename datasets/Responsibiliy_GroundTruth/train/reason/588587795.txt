The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling in the southbound travel lane and intended to pass through the intersection, while Vehicle 1, the 2013 Subaru Outback, was stopped at the intersection and intended to turn left to continue traveling northbound. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and the driver of Vehicle 2 attempted to brake and steer left to avoid a collision but was unsuccessful. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the collision as it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which had the right of way to make a left turn.
