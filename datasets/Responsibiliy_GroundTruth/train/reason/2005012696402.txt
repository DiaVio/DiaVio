The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver reported that her brakes had gone out, causing her to swerve to the right and ultimately collide with a tree off the roadway. The critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was a vehicle-related factor, specifically brake failure. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the failure of her vehicle's brakes.
