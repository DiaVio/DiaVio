The reason for this is that the case occupant's forward movement and subsequent injuries were a result of not being properly restrained by the seatbelt. Her movement to the right and the impact with various parts of the vehicle caused additional injuries. Additionally, her age and resulting loss of bone density contributed to the severity of her injuries. It is important to note that without further information about the actions of the driver of the 2000 Infinity I30t (V2), it cannot be determined if they share any responsibility for the accident.
