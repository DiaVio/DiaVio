The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to use due care by falsely assuming that the driver of Vehicle #2 would continue through the intersection without stopping. This false assumption led to the driver of Vehicle #1 not maintaining a safe distance and subsequently rear-ending Vehicle #2. Although the driver of Vehicle #2 did slam on his brakes when he realized the light had turned yellow, it can be argued that this was a reasonable response to the changing traffic signal. The driver of Vehicle #2 was following the rules of the road by attempting to stop for the yellow light, and it was the driver of Vehicle #1 who failed to react appropriately. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to use due care and maintain a safe distance.
