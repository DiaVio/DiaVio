The driver of V1 violated the traffic signal by failing to properly survey the intersection and collided with V2 (the driver of the 1992 Ford Taurus) on the left side. The driver of V1 was in a hurry and may have been distracted by a conversation with the front passenger. This, combined with inadequate surveillance, led to the traffic signal violation and subsequent collision.
