The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 89 kmph (55 mph) in a 52 kmph (35 mph) zone, which is considered excessive. Additionally, V1 applied the brakes, causing them to lock up and skid for a significant distance before colliding with the rear of V2 (the 1997 Pontiac Grand Am sedan). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and did not take adequate evasive action to avoid the collision. The impact from V1's collision with V2 then caused V1 to rotate and collide with V3 (the 2002 Nissan Pathfinder SUV). Therefore, V1's excessive speed, inadequate evasive action, and failure to maintain a safe following distance make them primarily responsible for the crash.
