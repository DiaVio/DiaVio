The driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle when the right front tire dropped off the edge of the road and struck loose rock and gravel. The driver's sharp steering to the left caused the vehicle to trip on the berm of the pavement and subsequently roll down the steep embankment. This loss of control ultimately led to the rollover and the driver's severe injuries.
