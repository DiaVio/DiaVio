The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was stopped at the eastern leg of the intersection, intending to cross over the northbound travel lanes. It entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2008 Chevrolet Trailblazer sport utility vehicle) which was already traveling northbound in the center lane. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1 in a "t-bone" configuration.
