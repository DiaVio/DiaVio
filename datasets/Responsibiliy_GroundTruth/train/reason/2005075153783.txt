The reason for this is that V1 was unable to stop and collided with the rear of V2 (1987 Jaguar XJ6 sedan), which then caused a chain reaction of collisions involving V3 (2001 Nissan Maxima sedan) and V4 (1982 Buick Regal coupe). The police reported travel speed for V1 and V2 was 56 kmph, indicating that V1 was traveling at the same speed as V2 and should have been able to stop in time to avoid the collision.
