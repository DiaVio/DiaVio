The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that he saw the left lane starting to take off and assumed the traffic in front of him would proceed to. This indicates that V1's driver was not paying enough attention to the traffic in front of him and made an incorrect assumption, leading to the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that the ABS system went out on him, suggesting a possible mechanical issue with the vehicle that may have contributed to the inability to stop in time. On the other hand, V2 (the 2000 Ford Windstar) was waiting at the red light in lane one, following the traffic rules and not contributing to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's lack of attention and incorrect assumption, as well as the possible mechanical issue with the vehicle.
