The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver became dizzy and nauseous, causing her to close her eyes briefly and veer off the right side of the roadway. This driver-related factor of being dizzy and nauseous led to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and insufficient avoidance maneuvers were associated factors in the crash.
