The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling at a high rate of speed, described by the police as greater than reasonable and prudent, and failed to slow down when V2 (the driver of the Dodge Omni) began to slow for the construction zone. This resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2. Additionally, the witness at the scene confirmed that V1 was proceeding at a high rate of speed and slammed into the back of V2. The police reported travel speed of 105 kmph for both vehicles further supports V1's excessive speed. Therefore, V1's failure to slow down and maintain a safe distance from V2, despite the presence of a construction zone and the need for traffic to slow down, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
