The driver of V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the cargo on V1's trailer was not properly secured, as evidenced by the worn straps that subsequently broke when the cargo shifted. This resulted in the lumber spilling onto V2 and the roadway, causing damage to V2 and potentially creating a hazardous situation for other vehicles. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and the improper securing of the cargo.
