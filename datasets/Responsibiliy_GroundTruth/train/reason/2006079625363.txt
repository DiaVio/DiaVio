The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the critical pre-crash event, the critical reason for this event was attributed to V1 as a driver-related factor. Although the specific type of driver error is unknown, it can be inferred that V1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1999 Ford Explorer). V2, on the other hand, stated that they had a green light when V1 suddenly turned in front of them. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while making a left turn at the intersection.
