The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was reported to have been intoxicated at the time of the crash, which impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver failed to properly observe the road ahead and failed to see the parked dump truck with its four-way flashers on. - The driver of V1 admitted to police and paramedics that he did not see the four-way flashers on the truck, suggesting a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver. - The fact that the driver of V1 had been drinking, combined with the reported inadequate surveillance, indicates that the driver's impairment and negligence were significant contributing factors to the crash. Therefore, V1 (the driver of the 1995 Buick Rivera) is primarily responsible for the crash due to their intoxication and failure to properly observe the roadway.
