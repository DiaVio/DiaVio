The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and turned with an obstructed view. The driver of V2 stated that the driver of the stopped vehicle in northbound lane two made a motion indicating that it was clear for him to proceed with his left turn. However, V2 failed to properly assess the situation and did not have a clear view of oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V1 (the 2005 Lexus RX330). While V1 stated that she did not see V2 until the last minute due to the non-contact vehicles in lane two, V2's failure to ensure a clear and safe left turn takes precedence in determining responsibility for the crash.
