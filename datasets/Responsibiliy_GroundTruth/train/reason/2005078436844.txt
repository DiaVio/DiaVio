The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver of V1 stated that they looked both ways but did not see V2. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the oncoming traffic. As a result, V1 entered the intersection without ensuring it was clear, leading to the collision with V2.
