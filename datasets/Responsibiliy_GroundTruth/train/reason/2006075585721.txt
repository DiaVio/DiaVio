The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was attributed to driver-related factor: inadequate surveillance. This indicates that the driver of vehicle one failed to adequately observe the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with vehicle two. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle two (1998 Nissan Sentra) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, across path." This suggests that vehicle two was already in the intersection and had the right of way when vehicle one collided with it. Therefore, based on the information provided, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of vehicle one due to their inadequate surveillance.
