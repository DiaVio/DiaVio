The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit, and was driving too fast for the curve. Additionally, the driver was a sixteen-year-old with only two months of driving experience, indicating a lack of experience and potentially inadequate judgment. Furthermore, the driver had been awake for sixteen hours at the time of the crash, suggesting fatigue may have played a role in the driver's ability to safely navigate the curve.
