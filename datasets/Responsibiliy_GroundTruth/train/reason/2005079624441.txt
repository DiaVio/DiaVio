The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one experienced a tread separation in the left rear tire, causing her to lose control of the vehicle. This tire/wheel deficiency is considered a vehicle-related factor and is the critical reason for the control loss. Additionally, the driver's previous injuries and lack of exercise, as well as her decision to stop taking medication for depression, may have contributed to her ability to handle the situation effectively. Furthermore, the driver's limited experience of only one year of driving and her attempt to stop the car by disengaging the ignition without the keys in the ignition demonstrate a lack of proper knowledge and response in such situations.
