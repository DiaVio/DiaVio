The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in lane one on the intersecting street while V1, the 2010 Ford Focus, was stopped in the westbound lane, waiting to make a left turn at the intersection. V1 began to turn left as V2 entered the intersection. Both drivers braked, but V2's front impacted the left side of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1.
