The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was following too closely to the non-contact vehicle in front of him, which prevented him from seeing V2 (the 2002 Honda Accord) until the non-contact vehicle changed lanes. If V1 had been following at a greater distance, he would have had more time to react and potentially avoid the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a speed of 105 kmph (65 mph), which was above the posted speed limit of 89 kmph (55 mph), further contributing to the inability to stop in time. While there were associated factors for both drivers, such as alcohol use and conversation with a passenger, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the following too closely and traveling at an excessive speed.
