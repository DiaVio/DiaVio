The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that V2 began decelerating to avoid an impact with V3 (the 1988 Jeep Comanche pickup) that pulled into lane three at a very slow rate of speed. V2 noticed V1 (the 1999 Chevrolet 2500 pickup) rapidly approaching in the rearview mirror and attempted to pull left onto the shoulder to avoid the impact. However, V2 was unable to move over far enough, resulting in the collision with V1. Therefore, V2's failure to properly react to the situation and avoid the collision with V1 makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
