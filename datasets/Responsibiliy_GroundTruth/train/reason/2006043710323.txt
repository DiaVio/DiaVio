The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a left turn across westbound lanes without properly seeing her way clear. She had a sight restriction caused by the non-contact school bus, and her inexperience as a driver (having her license for only 7 months) likely contributed to her decision-making error. Additionally, she was in a hurry to get to school and had a recent eye surgery that may have affected her vision.
