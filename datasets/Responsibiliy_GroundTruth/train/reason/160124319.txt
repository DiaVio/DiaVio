The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection while Vehicle Two (V2), the 2001 Ford F150, was approaching straight through the intersection. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the front of V2 contacting the right side of V1.
