The reason for this is that V2 drifted to the right over the paved shoulder and impacted the steel guard rail. It then deflected back into the westbound lane and continued over the center line into the opposite eastbound lane, where it collided with the front of Vehicle 1 (V1). V2's initial drift and subsequent crossing of the center line into oncoming traffic indicates that it was the vehicle that initiated the sequence of events leading to the crash.
