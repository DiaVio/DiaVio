The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by dialing a phone number on his cell phone, which caused him to drift off the right side of the road. While attempting to steer his truck back onto the roadway, he overcorrected and departed the left side of the road, leading to the rollover and collision with trees. Additionally, the driver admitted to drinking beer earlier in the day, which may have impaired his judgment and contributed to the overcompensation. The presence of alcohol, distracted driving, and narrow shoulders were all associated factors that contributed to the accident.
