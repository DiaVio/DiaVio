The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn across traffic, which requires the driver to yield to oncoming vehicles. V1, on the other hand, was traveling straight through the intersection in the northbound lane, which gives them the right of way. V2 failed to yield to V1 and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the associated factors for V2, such as not having a driver's license, it being her first time driving this vehicle, and her first time driving this roadway, suggest a lack of experience and familiarity with the traffic conditions. These factors may have contributed to her error in judgment and failure to yield. Overall, V2's actions and lack of experience make her primarily responsible for the accident.
