The reason for this is that V1 lost control while negotiating a curve, resulting in the vehicle rotating clockwise and departing the roadway. V1 then continued to roll and eventually flipped end over end, causing significant damage and injuries to both occupants. The driver of V1 was wearing a seatbelt and the airbag deployed, indicating that safety measures were in place but the driver was still unable to maintain control of the vehicle.
