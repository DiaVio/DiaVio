The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel due to fatigue. This resulted in V1 crossing into the northbound lane and colliding with V2, which was parked and unattended. The driver's fatigue and falling asleep while driving is a clear violation of safe driving practices and contributed to the occurrence of the accident.
