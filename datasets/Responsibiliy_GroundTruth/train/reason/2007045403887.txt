The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately assess the situation and made a decision to cross the northbound lanes without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. V2 admitted to being fatigued, which likely impaired her judgment and ability to properly assess the situation. Additionally, V2's view was obstructed by the presence of the 18-wheeler in lane 2, which further contributed to the decision error. While V1, the driver of the Chevy K2500, mentioned that he did not see V2 until just before impact, it can be argued that V1 had the right of way and was traveling within the speed limit. V1's view was obstructed by the presence of the 18-wheeler, which was a contributing factor assigned to V1. Overall, V2's decision to cross the northbound lanes without a clear view and while fatigued, along with the obstructed view, make V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
