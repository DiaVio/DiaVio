The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the northbound lane from the eastbound approach. However, due to heavy traffic and a larger non-contact vehicle on the right, the driver of V1 had a limited view of the oncoming traffic from the north. Despite the horn being blown by V2 (the Ford tractor-trailer) to alert V1 that it was not clear to proceed, V1 decided to accelerate straight onto the shoulder in an attempt to avoid the collision. This maneuver was unsuccessful, resulting in V2 striking the right rear side of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision to make a left turn with an obstructed view and incorrect evasive action.
