The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a 16-year-old female, was reaching for a cell phone when she lost control of the vehicle. This distraction caused V1 to briefly depart the roadway to the right, re-enter the roadway, and then depart the roadway to the left, ultimately resulting in the crash. Additionally, the driver's limited driving experience of only fourteen months, with less than two months of unsupervised driving, may have contributed to her inability to effectively handle the situation and maintain control of the vehicle.
