The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was making a left turn maneuver into the intersection, placing itself in the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1974 Chevrolet C10 pickup. V2 was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. As a result, V2 collided with the left front of V1, causing severe damage to both vehicles and resulting in serious injury to the case subject. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to yield the right of way and making a left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so.
