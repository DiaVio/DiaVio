The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event, V1 had a false assumption of V2's actions. V1 thought that V2 would stop for the yellow light, but V2 continued through the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the associated factors of driver inattention and failure to look far enough ahead contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident. V1's focus on the meeting she had just attended and failure to properly assess the situation led to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
