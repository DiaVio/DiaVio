The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded to cross the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Cavalier). V2 was already traveling northbound in the second lane of the five-lane road when V1 entered the intersection, resulting in the front of V2 impacting the right side of V1. Additionally, V1 and V2 then side-slapped, indicating that V1's movement across the intersection was not done safely or with proper caution. The fact that a piece of equipment came off of V1's trailer and impacted V2 further suggests that V1's actions were negligent. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their unsafe crossing of the intersection.
