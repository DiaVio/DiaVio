The reason for this is that V2 was traveling north in lane one and stopped at a signal. When the signal turned green, V2 proceeded into the intersection and was struck by V1 on the right side. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was "this vehicle traveling-crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V2 was the vehicle that entered the intersection and caused the collision. Although the driver of V1 stated that he did not know what happened or who had the green light, V1 made no avoidance maneuver, suggesting that V1 had the right of way and was unable to avoid the collision with V2. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and crossing into the path of V1.
