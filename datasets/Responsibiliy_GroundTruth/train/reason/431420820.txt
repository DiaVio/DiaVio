The reason for this is that the case occupant, who was the right front passenger in Vehicle 1 (2007 Toyota Scion TC), was not restrained by the available 3-point manual lap and shoulder belt. This lack of restraint contributed to the occupant's movement forward and to the left upon impact. Additionally, the fact that the instrument panel mounted airbag in Vehicle 1 did not deploy suggests that the impact was not severe enough to trigger its deployment. This further indicates that the primary force and impact came from Vehicle 2, the Toyota Tacoma. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
