The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 admitted to smoking marijuana and having alcohol in the vehicle prior to the crash, indicating impaired judgment and decision-making. - The driver of V1 made a sudden and improper lane change from lane one to lane two without properly checking for other vehicles. - V1's sudden lane change resulted in a collision with V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Venture minivan), causing V2 to decelerate suddenly and come to rest in lane two. - The driver of V1 also admitted to panicking at the sight of a police cruiser and attempting a u-turn at the intersection, further indicating poor decision-making and lack of attention to the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's impaired state, improper lane change, and panicked actions.
