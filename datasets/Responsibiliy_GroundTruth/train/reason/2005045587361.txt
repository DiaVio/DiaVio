The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was under the influence of medications that she knew would impair her ability to operate a vehicle. She admitted to taking medications for seizures, alcoholism, and depression, and acknowledged that she should not have been driving while under the influence of these drugs. Additionally, the driver had undergone brain surgery just three weeks prior to the crash, which may have further affected her ability to safely operate the vehicle. The EDR data retrieved from Vehicle #1 also indicates that the driver failed to adequately control the vehicle. The maximum velocity change recorded was 25.4kph (15.82mph), indicating that the driver was unable to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle #2. The pre-crash graph shows that the brake switch status was on for the entire 5 seconds prior to the algorithm enable, suggesting that the driver attempted to brake but was unable to do so effectively. Furthermore, the associated factors coded for Vehicle #1, such as inadequate evasive actions and poor directional control, further support the conclusion that the driver of Vehicle #1 was primarily responsible for the accident. In contrast, Vehicle #2 (the 2005 GMC 3500 series flatbed pickup) was stopped at the intersection for several seconds prior to the collision and the critical reason for the critical event was not associated with this vehicle. The only associated factor coded for Vehicle #2 was rain, which does not contribute to the primary responsibility for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
