The reason for this is that V2 was traveling behind V1 and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the front of V2 impacting the back of V1. This impact caused V1 to be forced into the opposite lane of travel and subsequently collide with Vehicle Three (V3), the 1996 Lincoln Town Car. V2's failure to maintain a safe distance and avoid colliding with V1 ultimately led to the chain of events that caused the accident.
