The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a vacant lot on the right side of the roadway. She stated that when she looked back at the roadway, V2 and V3 had already stopped, and she was unable to avoid a collision. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the medications she takes for her medical conditions can cause her mind to wander off. Therefore, V1's distraction and delayed reaction in response to the stopped vehicles ahead indicate that she failed to maintain a proper lookout and exercise due care, resulting in the collision.
