The driver of V1 made an evasive action to avoid contact with a non-contact vehicle, but lost control of the vehicle and spun into the westbound lane, ultimately colliding with V2 (the Toyota Camry) and V3 (the Ford E-Series van). The critical reason for the critical event of V1 losing control was that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. The rain and wet roads were coded as roadway factors. Additionally, the driver's medical conditions, such as sleep apnea and pulmonary hypertension, along with the medications he was taking, may have contributed to his ability to respond effectively to the unexpected actions of others on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed for the road conditions and inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
