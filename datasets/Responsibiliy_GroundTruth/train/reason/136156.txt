The reason for this is that the driver of V2 reportedly reached for an object on the floor, causing V2 to drift to the left and collide with Vehicle three (V3). V2 was then redirected back into the right northbound lane, where Vehicle one (V1) was nearly at a stop due to traffic congestion. The front of V2 subsequently struck the rear of V1 in an offset configuration. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V2, reaching for an object and drifting into another lane, directly caused the initial collision with V3 and the subsequent collision with V1.
