The reason for this is that V2 was traveling south in the left southbound lane, while V1 was in the center turn-lane, indicating an intention to make a left turn. V2 entered the intersection and struck the right side of V1 in an angled T-type configuration. This suggests that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the collision.
