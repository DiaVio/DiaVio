The reason for this is that V1 veered left across the path of V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt), causing the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating poor directional control. Additionally, it was reported that a dog inside V1 had jumped on the driver, causing an internal distraction. These factors suggest that V1 was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle and was distracted at the time of the crash. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in their designated lane and stated that they had no time to react to V1's sudden veering. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their poor directional control and internal distraction caused by the dog jumping on the driver.
