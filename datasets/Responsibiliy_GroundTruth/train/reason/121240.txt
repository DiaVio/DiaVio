The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 confused the accelerator and brake pedals, causing the vehicle to accelerate instead of slowing down. This resulted in V1 crossing lanes, climbing an embankment, and ultimately colliding with a building and a wooden fence. The driver's confusion and incorrect operation of the vehicle led to the sequence of events that caused the accident.
