The reason for this is that V1 swerved into the center turn lane, where V2 (the driver of the dark green Honda Accord) was stopped, preparing to turn left. The critical event for V1 was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling-over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 crossed over into the center turn lane, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event of V1 was assigned as a "Driver Related Factor - Internal distraction." The V1 driver stated to the police that he had swatted with a newspaper at a bee that flew at his face. This internal distraction likely caused V1 to lose control and swerve into the center turn lane, leading to the collision with V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their actions and internal distraction.
