The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was following too closely to the vehicle in front of her, which is indicated by the critical reason coded as 'a driver related decision factor of following too closely to respond to unexpected actions of other road users'. This suggests that the driver of V1 did not maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead, which resulted in her being unable to respond in time when the vehicle in front suddenly braked hard and slowed down. Additionally, the contributing factor of 'aggressive driving-tailgating' further supports the notion that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and was driving too closely to the vehicle ahead. Although V1 was able to successfully avoid a previous critical event, the fact that the driver had to swerve and brake abruptly indicates that she was not able to react in a safe and controlled manner. Furthermore, the associated factor of 'low air pressure and tread on the rear tires' may have also contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle during the avoidance maneuver. However, this does not absolve the driver of V1 from the primary responsibility for the crash.
