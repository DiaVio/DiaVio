The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption of V2's actions and assumed that V2 was going to yield the right of way. V1 stated that she saw V2 slowing down and assumed it was going to yield, leading her to initiate the left turn. However, V2 was actually intending to travel straight through the intersection. Additionally, V1's view was obstructed by vehicles waiting to turn north at the intersection, which further contributed to her false assumption. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to accurately assess the situation and yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
