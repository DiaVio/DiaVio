The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to negotiate the left curve and allowed the vehicle to depart the right pavement edge. This resulted in the vehicle striking a barrier curb and subsequently a utility pole, causing moderate damage. The vehicle then rotated clockwise and came to rest in the eastbound travel lane. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the roadway ultimately led to the accident.
