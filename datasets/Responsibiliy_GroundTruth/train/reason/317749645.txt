The reason for this is that V1 drifted off the roadway onto the right roadside, indicating a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, V1 continued to travel off the roadway and collided with a large culvert on the left roadside, suggesting a lack of proper steering and braking control. These actions ultimately led to the disabling damage of V1 and the moderate injuries sustained by the driver.
