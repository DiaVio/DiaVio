The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced a diabetic attack and passed out while driving. This physical impairment of the ability to act resulted in the driver losing control of the vehicle and colliding with the rear of V2 (the 2003 Toyota Camry) and subsequently striking the left side of V3 (the vehicle turning right). The driver's inability to control the vehicle due to the diabetic attack is the main factor contributing to the crash.
