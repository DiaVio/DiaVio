The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the roadway before making a right turn. Instead of turning into the number one travel lane, V1 entered the number two travel lane where V2 (the driver of the 2003 Chevrolet Trail Blazer) was traveling. V1's inadequate surveillance and unsafe decision to enter V2's path of travel led to the collision.
