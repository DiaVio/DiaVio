The reason for this is that V1 was making a left-turn maneuver and entered the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic. V2, the 1983 Mercedes Benz 300D, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. V1's failure to yield and turning into the path of V2 resulted in the frontal impact collision.
