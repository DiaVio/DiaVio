The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of 34-48 kmph (21-30 mph) on an icy roadway, which was too fast for the conditions. Additionally, the driver was under the influence of alcohol (BAC=0.12) and was looking at the oncoming car, which distracted their attention from the road. These factors contributed to the driver losing control of the vehicle and ultimately colliding with a utility pole. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their driver-related errors, including driving too fast for the icy conditions, being under the influence of alcohol, and being distracted by looking at the oncoming car.
