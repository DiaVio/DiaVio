The critical precrash event for V1 indicates that there was another vehicle (V2) stopped in the same lane, and V1 struck the rear of V2. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was intoxicated at the time of the crash, although the results of alcohol testing were not provided. Without further details from interviews or cooperation from legal counsel, it is difficult to determine the exact reason for V1's error. However, the combination of V1's failure to notice the stopped vehicle and the potential influence of alcohol suggests that V1's actions were the main cause of the accident.
