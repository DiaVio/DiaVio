The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others. This is evident from the fact that V1 struck the rear of V2, which was stopped behind V3. V1's inability to stop in time indicates that they were not maintaining a safe following distance or were not paying enough attention to the road conditions and the vehicles ahead of them.
