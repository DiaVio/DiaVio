The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and poor directional control, which led to the vehicle departing the right road edge and ultimately causing the crash. Additionally, the driver had just purchased the vehicle the day before and had limited experience driving it, which may have contributed to the driver's poor control of the vehicle.
