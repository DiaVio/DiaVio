The reason for this is that V1 lost control and impacted an iron fence on the northeast corner of the intersection. The driver of V1 reported that a van (non-contact vehicle) attempted to make a left turn in front of him, and in an attempt to avoid the van, V1 overcompensated while braking and steering right, resulting in the loss of control and the subsequent collision with the fence. While the van (non-contact vehicle) may have contributed to the situation by attempting to make a left turn in front of V1, it was ultimately V1's actions of overcompensating and losing control that led to the accident.
