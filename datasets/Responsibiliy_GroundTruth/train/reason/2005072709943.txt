The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of 122 kmph (76 mph) in wet conditions, which was above the speed limit of 67 kmph (40 mph). Additionally, the driver admitted to being in a hurry to get home, indicating a disregard for the safety of others on the road. These factors, along with the fact that V1 veered across all travel lanes and onto the off ramp, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 1995 Honda Civic), demonstrate that V1's actions were the main cause of the accident.
