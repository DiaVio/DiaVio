The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to not realizing that the vehicle in front of her had stopped, indicating a recognition error and inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the critical precrash event coded to Vehicle 1 was "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane, Other Vehicle Stopped," further supporting the driver's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle ahead. The driver's lack of experience, with only two years of driving, may have contributed to the error in judgment.
