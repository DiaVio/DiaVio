The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver misjudged the gap or the speed of Vehicle #2 (2001 GMC Sonoma pickup) while attempting to make a left turn onto the intersecting side street. Although the driver of Vehicle #1 stated that she thought Vehicle #2 was turning right onto the side street, her statement was not deemed reliable. This misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed led to the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was taking medications to treat high blood pressure and diabetes, which may have affected her judgment or perception. The fact that she was wearing bifocals at the time of the crash could also have potentially impacted her ability to accurately assess the situation. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle #2 was traveling within the posted speed limit and did not take any evasive actions. He stated that his attention might have been directed towards the intersecting roadway to his right, as vehicles are known to pull out in front of him at that spot. However, this does not absolve Vehicle #1 of responsibility for misjudging the gap and causing the collision. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed while attempting to make a left turn.
