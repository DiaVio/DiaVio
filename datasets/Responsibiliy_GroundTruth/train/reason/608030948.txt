The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 made a left-turn and crossed the path of V2, which resulted in the collision. It is the responsibility of the driver making a left-turn to yield to oncoming traffic, and in this case, V1 failed to do so. Additionally, V2 was traveling in the outside lane, which means they had the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and crossing the path of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
