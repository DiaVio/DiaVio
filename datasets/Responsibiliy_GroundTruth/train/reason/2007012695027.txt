The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver lost control of the vehicle, fishtailed, and was unable to regain control, ultimately resulting in V1 departing the roadway and rolling over. The driver's speed, combined with the slick and icy road conditions, contributed to the crash.
