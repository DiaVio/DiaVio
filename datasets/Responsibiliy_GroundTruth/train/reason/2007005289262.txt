The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 admitted that she never saw the other vehicle until it was too late, indicating a failure to properly observe the intersection before proceeding. Despite claiming that her sightline was clear and there were no obstructions, the driver's failure to notice the approaching vehicle suggests a lack of attention and awareness. Additionally, V1's statement about trying to find a shortcut to the pharmacy indicates a potential distraction or lack of focus on the road. This, combined with the driver's age (78 years old) and the fact that she was taking medication for her heart and memory, raises concerns about her ability to safely operate a vehicle. Overall, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and her potential distractions and health conditions contribute to her primary responsibility for the accident.
