The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was illegally passing a non-contact vehicle at a high rate of speed in the eastbound lane, which is an aggressive driving behavior. - V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions and made an illegal maneuver by crossing the full barrier line while passing. - V1 was also engaged in aggressive driving behaviors such as speeding and rapid/frequent lane changes/weaving. These factors indicate that V1 was not following the rules of the road and was engaging in dangerous driving behaviors, which ultimately led to the collision with V2.
