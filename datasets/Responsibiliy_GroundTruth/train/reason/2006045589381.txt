The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was unable to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle #2 (the 1993 Nissan Altima), which then pushed Vehicle #2 into the rear of Vehicle #3 (the 1994 Pontiac Bonneville). This indicates that Vehicle #1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by looking at a restaurant on the left side of the road just prior to the crash. This external distraction likely contributed to the driver's failure to notice the traffic in front of them coming to a stop. Furthermore, the EDR data extracted from Vehicle #1 showed that the vehicle's speed was decreasing in the seconds leading up to the crash, indicating that the driver was not able to react in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following improperly and being distracted.
