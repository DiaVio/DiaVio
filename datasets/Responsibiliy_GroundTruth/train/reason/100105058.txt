The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost traction while negotiating the left sweeping curve, causing the vehicle to slide to the right. Instead of regaining stability, the driver's turning maneuvers resulted in the vehicle traveling off the left roadside and tripping over the embankment. This ultimately led to the vehicle rolling multiple times until it came to rest on its top. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control and subsequent actions that caused the vehicle to leave the roadway and roll over.
