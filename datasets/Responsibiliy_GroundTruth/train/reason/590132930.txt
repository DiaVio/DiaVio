The reason for this is that V2 drove into the intersection intending to travel straight through, but collided with the left front of V1, the 2004 Mercury Mountaineer. V1's driver attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, while V2 attempted to steer left away from the impending collision. The impact between V2 and V1 caused V1 to be redirected to the right and resulted in a side-slap collision between the left rear of V1 and the right rear of V2. Ultimately, V2's failure to yield the right of way and colliding with V1 in the intersection makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
