The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 noticed two vehicles in front of him had stopped and attempted to avoid the crash by steering to the left and applying his brakes. However, V2 locked up his brakes and skidded into the southbound lane, resulting in the collision with V1. This indicates that V2 was unable to maintain control of his vehicle and failed to stop in time to avoid the crash.
