The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the icy roadway. Despite traveling on a curved roadway with a known uphill grade and icy conditions, the driver did not adjust their driving behavior accordingly. The driver stated that they did not realize the road was ice-covered until they lost control after the curve. This indicates a lack of attentiveness and failure to adapt to the road conditions. Additionally, the driver's actions of steering right and then left, causing the vehicle to rotate in opposite directions, further contributed to the loss of control and ultimately resulted in V1 traveling off the right side of the roadway and rolling over into the ditch. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adapt to the icy road conditions and maintain control of the vehicle.
