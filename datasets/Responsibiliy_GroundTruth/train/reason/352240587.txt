The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 steered right and departed the north edge of the roadway in an attempt to avoid hitting a deer. This action ultimately led to the vehicle colliding with a steel pole and subsequently rolling over. Therefore, the driver's decision to steer off the road and the subsequent loss of control of the vehicle are the primary factors contributing to the accident.
