The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it made a left turn at the intersection onto the westbound roadway, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2005 Ford Econoline E250 large van, which was traveling east in the eastbound lane. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
