The reason for this is that V1 was changing lanes to the right, and V2's front plane impacted V1's right plane. This indicates that V1 was not properly checking for other vehicles before changing lanes, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, suggesting that V1 may have been driving erratically or not maintaining proper lane discipline. Therefore, V1's failure to properly change lanes and maintain lane discipline makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
