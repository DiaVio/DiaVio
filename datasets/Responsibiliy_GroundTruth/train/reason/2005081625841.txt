V1 was unable to stop and collided with the back of Vehicle #2 (V2), causing V2 to move forward and collide with the back of Vehicle #3 (V3). The critical reason for V1's involvement in the crash was "inattention." The driver of V1 stated that he was just driving and hit the other vehicle, indicating a lack of attention or focus on the road ahead. This suggests that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the stopped traffic and did not react in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to stop in time make them primarily responsible for the crash.
