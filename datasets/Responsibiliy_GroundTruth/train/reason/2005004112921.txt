The reason for V1's responsibility is that they failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign intersection. Despite stopping and looking both ways, V1 did not see V2 approaching from the eastbound lane and proceeded through the intersection, resulting in the collision. V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and recognize the presence of V2 led to the accident.
