The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by steering left and running off the roadway to avoid the non-contact vehicle that cut him off. This incorrect evasive action led to V1 colliding with a light pole on the southwest corner of the intersection. The driver's decision to steer left instead of taking appropriate measures to avoid the collision ultimately resulted in the accident.
