The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The witness stated that V1 did not stop prior to entering the intersection and did not see the brake lights come on before the impact. Additionally, the witness mentioned that the driver might have been in a hurry. These factors indicate that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1999 Ford F-150) saw the truck in the number two lane making a left turn and attempted to brake, but was unable to stop in time. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision as they were following the traffic rules and attempting to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
