The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to see Vehicle #1 (V1) coming from his left and entered the roadway in front of V1. The driver of V2 reported that his view of V1 was blocked by a non-contact vehicle that was in the first eastbound lane, getting ready to make a right turn into a driveway. However, it is the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to do so before entering the roadway. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned that he was in a hurry due to his work schedule, which could have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation and make a safe left turn. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield the right of way and their associated factor of being in a hurry.
