The critical event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection" and the critical reason for this event was "inadequate surveillance." This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. Additionally, the associative factors associated with the driver of V1 further support their responsibility. The driver stated that they rarely drive and have infrequent travel on this roadway, indicating a lack of familiarity with the intersection. The presence of a large vehicle turning in front of V1 may have partially blocked their view, but it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure that it is safe to proceed with the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
