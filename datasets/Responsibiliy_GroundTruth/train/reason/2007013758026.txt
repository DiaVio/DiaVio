The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that she was passing a semi tractor when it came into her lane. In response, she steered to the left, causing her left side tires to hit the rumble strips on the shoulder of the road. This incorrect evasive action led to the loss of control of her vehicle, ultimately resulting in V1 leaving the roadway and rolling over. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's incorrect evasive action and subsequent loss of control.
