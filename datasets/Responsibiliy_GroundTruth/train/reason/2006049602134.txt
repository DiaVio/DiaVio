The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; illegal maneuver." This suggests that the driver of V1 was engaged in an illegal maneuver while crossing the intersection, which resulted in the collision with V2. Since V1 was the vehicle making the illegal maneuver, it can be concluded that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
