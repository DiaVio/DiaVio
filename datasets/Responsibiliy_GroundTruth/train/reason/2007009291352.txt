Reason: V1 was driving at a higher speed than the posted limit in a metro area with heavy commuter traffic. Additionally, V1 was unable to stop in time to avoid the vehicle (V2) in front of them, indicating a decision error of traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. The downhill slope and the fact that V1's skid marks began only two meters prior to the impact location further suggest that V1 was unable to stop in time.
