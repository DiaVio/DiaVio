The reason for this is that V1 lost control while negotiating the curve and departed the roadway to the left. V1 then traveled down the embankment and impacted a tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal airbag. The fact that V1 left the roadway and collided with a tree suggests that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
