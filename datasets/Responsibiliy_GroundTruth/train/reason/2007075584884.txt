The reason for this is that V1 was distracted and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). Additionally, the driver of V1 had only five months of driving experience at the time of the crash, which suggests a lack of experience and potentially poor judgment in handling the situation. While V2 (the driver of the 1995 Dodge Neon) also had a critical pre-crash event coded as "other vehicle encroachment," indicating that V1 crossed their path, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to properly observe the intersection and yield the right of way. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their distracted driving and inadequate surveillance, which resulted in the collision with V2.
