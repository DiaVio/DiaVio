The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was coded as being inattentive and failed to look to the side as she entered the intersection. Additionally, she claimed to have a solid green light but was not very sure of anything else, which was discounted as not credible. The use of prescription medications was also coded as an associated factor. While Vehicle #2 (the 2004 Chevrolet Suburban) had a sightline restriction due to the building and shrubbery at the southwest corner of the intersection, and was unfamiliar with the roadway, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 due to the driver's inattention and failure to properly observe the intersection.
