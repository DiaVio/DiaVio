The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to not stopping at the stop sign and entering the intersection without yielding to the right of way of Vehicle #2 (2007 Chevrolet Impala). The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that she was distracted and not paying attention to her surroundings due to an argument with someone outside of her vehicle. This distraction led to her failure to observe the approaching Vehicle #2 and resulted in the collision. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign, distracted driving, and failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2.
