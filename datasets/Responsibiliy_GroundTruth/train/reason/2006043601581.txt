The reason for this is that V1 admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming while driving. She stated that she may have glanced away from the road for an unknown reason, and she did not remember seeing the truck in her lane before the crash. This indicates a lack of attention and focus on the roadway, which ultimately led to her colliding with the back of V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Ranger Supercab) was slowing down to make a right turn at a driveway, which is a normal and expected maneuver. V2 was struck from behind by V1, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and failed to react in time to the slowing vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to her inattentiveness and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
