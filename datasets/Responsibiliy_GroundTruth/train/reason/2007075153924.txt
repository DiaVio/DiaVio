The driver of V1 was speeding, going 72 kmph in a 56 kmph zone, which indicates that he was traveling too fast for the curve. Additionally, the driver overcompensated when the vehicle started to rotate counterclockwise, which led to the vehicle rotating clockwise and ultimately leaving the roadway. The driver's inexperience, as he had only been driving for three months, likely contributed to his inability to properly handle the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factors of speeding, overcompensation, and inexperience.
