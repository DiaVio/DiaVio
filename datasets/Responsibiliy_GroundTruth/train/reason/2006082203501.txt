The reason for this is that V1 was reportedly traveling at a high rate of speed, which indicates that they were not adhering to the speed limit and were potentially driving too fast for the conditions of the roadway. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control." These factors suggest that V1 was not able to maintain control of their vehicle, leading to the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1990 Chevrolet K2500 pickup) stated that he braked after V1 crossed in front of him but was unable to stop before colliding with V1. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other; not involved first harmful event," indicating that V2's actions were not directly related to the cause of the crash. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their excessive speed and poor vehicle control.
