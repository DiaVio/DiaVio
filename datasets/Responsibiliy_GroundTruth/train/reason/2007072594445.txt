The driver of V1 attempted to make a U-turn at the end of the pillars, which is an illegal maneuver. This illegal maneuver, combined with the driver's failure to look to the left, resulted in V1 encroaching into the lane of V2 (the 2001 Nova bus). As a result, the front of V2 struck the left side of V1, causing the subsequent collision.
