The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed while exiting the freeway, which indicates a lack of control and potentially reckless driving. Additionally, V1 departed the ramp to the left, which suggests a failure to follow the proper path of the off-ramp. The impact with the ground, dislodging of the bumper cover, and opening of the hood further indicate a lack of control and potentially aggressive driving behavior. Finally, the collision with the tree and the serious injuries sustained by the case occupant highlight the severity of the crash, which can be attributed to the actions of V1.
