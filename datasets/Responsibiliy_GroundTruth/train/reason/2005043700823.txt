The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and traveled across the median, ultimately rolling over and coming to rest on its left side on the eastbound shoulder. The investigating officer estimated V1's travel and impact speeds to be 65 mph, which indicates that V1 was likely traveling at an excessive speed for the road conditions. Additionally, the driver of V1 had alcohol present in his system, which could have impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. The driver's associated factors, such as recently retiring from his job and possibly being in a hurry to catch a flight, may have contributed to his decision to drive recklessly. Overall, V1's loss of control, excessive speed, and the presence of alcohol in the driver's system indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
