The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was actually asleep at the time of the crash, which was determined to be the critical reason for the accident. The driver stated that he remembers looking up and seeing the mile marker sign, indicating that he had momentarily fallen asleep while driving. This driver-related factor of being asleep while operating the vehicle directly led to V1 running off the right side of the roadway and causing the crash.
