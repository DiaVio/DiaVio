The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn, which means it had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V2, traveling southbound in lane two, had the right of way and was not at fault for the collision. V1's failure to yield resulted in the front left of V2 striking the right side of V1, causing the accident.
