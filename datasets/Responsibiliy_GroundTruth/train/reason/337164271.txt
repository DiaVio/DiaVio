The reason for this is that V2 initially went off the southbound travel lane, contacted the guard rail, and then crossed over into the northbound travel lane. V2 continued across the northbound lane and ultimately collided with the front of V1. This sequence of events indicates that V2 was the vehicle that deviated from its lane and caused the collision.
