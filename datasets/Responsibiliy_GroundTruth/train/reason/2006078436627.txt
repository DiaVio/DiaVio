The driver of V1 was attempting to elude police and was traveling at a high speed, approximately 56 kmph (35 mph) above the posted speed limit. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's attempt to avoid a spike strip, led to the vehicle losing control and rolling over. The driver's overcompensation on the gravel shoulder caused the vehicle to initiate a clockwise rotation, ultimately resulting in the rollover. Additionally, the weight of the 23 occupants in the vehicle contributed to suspension and steering deficiencies, further compromising the stability and handling of the vehicle.
