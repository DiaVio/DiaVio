The driver's reaction to the perceived impending impact with construction barrels, specifically her over-correction by steering left after hitting a construction barrel on the right front side of the vehicle, led to the vehicle departing the roadway, entering a counter-clockwise rotation, and ultimately rolling over multiple times. This indicates a loss of control by the driver, which is a significant factor in determining responsibility for the accident.
