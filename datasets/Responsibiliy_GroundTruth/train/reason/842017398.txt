The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling downhill on a two-lane rural roadway and subsequently exited the roadway into a private yard. It then sideswiped two trees and ultimately collided with a large diameter tree, resulting in moderate damage. The driver of Vehicle 1 also reportedly lost consciousness, which may have contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the restrained 66-year-old female front right passenger of Vehicle 1 sustained serious injuries due to being out-of-position and leaning forward at the time of impact. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 may not have been exercising proper control of the vehicle, leading to the passenger's injuries. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its actions and the resulting injuries sustained by its occupants.
