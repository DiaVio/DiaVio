The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver exhibited poor directional control, failing to control the vehicle with the skills ordinarily expected. This is evident from the fact that V1 turned left onto the roadway, accelerated for a short distance, and then traveled off the roadway to the right, ultimately striking a sign and a tree. The driver's lack of control over the vehicle resulted in the crash. Additionally, several associated factors contribute to V1's responsibility. These factors include the driver's high alcohol level (.226), cocaine use, use of prescription medication, inadequate evasive action, and the presence of snow and snow-covered roadways. These factors impaired the driver's ability to safely operate the vehicle and make appropriate decisions while driving. Furthermore, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway and being upset about having to drive across town for laundry may have also contributed to the lack of attention and focus, further increasing the likelihood of the crash. Overall, V1's driver's poor directional control, impaired state, and other associated factors make them primarily responsible for the crash.
