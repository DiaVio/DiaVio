The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2 and proceeded with the turn, resulting in the collision. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that the intersection was clear before making the turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Solstice) stated that she saw V1 right as he pulled out and applied the brakes but could not avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 had the right of way and was unable to avoid the collision due to V1's failure to yield. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
