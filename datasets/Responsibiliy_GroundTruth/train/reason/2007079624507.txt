The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that drifted to the right and made contact with the rear of V2's cargo area. The driver of V1 was distracted by her cell phone ringing and was looking for it inside the vehicle, which caused her to veer off course. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, having only had 4.5 hours of sleep in the past 24 hours. These factors contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid the collision.
