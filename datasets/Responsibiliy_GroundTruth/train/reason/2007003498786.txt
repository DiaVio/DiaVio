The driver of V1 failed to stop for the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. This is supported by the skid marks left by V1, indicating that the driver attempted to brake for the stop sign but was unable to stop in time. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported that V2 stopped in the middle of the intersection, suggesting that V1 did not have the right of way. On the other hand, V2 (the Acura TSX) stopped at the stop sign, looked for other cars, and proceeded to make a left turn when there were no cars present. The driver of V2 attempted to accelerate to speed up and avoid the collision, but V1 hit the left back door and wheel of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop for the stop sign and their illegal maneuver.
