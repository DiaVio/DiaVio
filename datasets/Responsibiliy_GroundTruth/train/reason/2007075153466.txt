The driver of V1 failed to stop for traffic and struck the rear of V2, which then propelled V2 forward to strike the rear of V3. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and did not react in time to the stopped traffic ahead. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with lower steady speed," suggesting that V1 was aware of the presence of V2 but failed to adjust their speed accordingly. The driver of V1 also admitted to being distracted, as she glanced down before the crash occurred. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for traffic, inadequate surveillance, and internal distraction make them primarily responsible for the accident.
