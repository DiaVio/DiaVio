The reason for this is that the driver of V1 became distracted and looked away from the road, causing the vehicle to depart from the roadway and ultimately collide with a fire hydrant. The driver's internal distraction and lack of surveillance contributed to the accident. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as she had only been driving for two months, likely played a role in her inability to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent the collision.
