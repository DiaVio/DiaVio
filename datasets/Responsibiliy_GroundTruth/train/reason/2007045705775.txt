The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, D1, was traveling at a high rate of speed and changed lanes without adequate surveillance. D1 was also inattentive and traveling too fast, which contributed to the crash. Additionally, D1 admitted to being in a hurry and slamming on her brakes, indicating a lack of proper control of the vehicle. On the other hand, V2 (the 1998 Chevrolet Astro cargo van) was stopped in lane 2 in order to let the vehicle in front of it turn left. V2's driver, D2, was following proper traffic rules and was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to D1's reckless driving behavior and failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle.
