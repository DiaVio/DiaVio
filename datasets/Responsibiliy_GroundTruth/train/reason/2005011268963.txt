The reason for this is that V1 struck V2 in the back, which then caused V2 to collide with V3. V1's driver was reported to be distracted by the sun in her eyes after making a U-turn, and she was also dealing with multiple health conditions and taking numerous medications that could have potentially caused drowsiness or impaired her ability to drive safely. The driver's inattention, combined with her health issues and medication use, contributed to the crash.
