The driver of V1 stated that the light was red as he was turning left, indicating that he violated the traffic signal. Additionally, the driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of the other road user (V2) by thinking that V2 would stop. This decision error led to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1992 Ford Escort coupe) stated that he was going straight in the southbound lane and saw V1 turning in front of him. He attempted to brake and avoid the collision but was unable to do so. There is no critical reason coded to the driver of V2, indicating that their actions were not a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their violation of the traffic signal and false assumption of the actions of the other road user.
