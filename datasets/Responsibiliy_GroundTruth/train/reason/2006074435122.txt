The driver of V1 stated that he had a yellow light when he proceeded through the intersection. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to adequately observe the intersection and failed to notice the oncoming V2. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 was crossing the street and V1's vehicle crossed its path. However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 was not primarily responsible for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to inadequate surveillance.
