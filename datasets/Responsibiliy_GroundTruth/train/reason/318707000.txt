The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 proceeded to turn left across the path of Vehicle 1 (the 2010 Dodge Charger) without yielding the right of way, blocking Vehicle 1's travel lane with its trailer. This action by Vehicle 2 directly caused the collision between the front of Vehicle 1 and the rear axle and undercarriage of Vehicle 2.
