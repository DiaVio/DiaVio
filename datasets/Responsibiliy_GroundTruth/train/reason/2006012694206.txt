The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for V2, who was stopped in the northbound lane waiting to turn into a driveway. V1's front contacted V2's rear, causing the collision. V1 stated that she was distracted by a golf cart traveling southbound on the roadway and was also fatigued, which contributed to her inadequate surveillance and failure to stop in time. While V2 was also distracted and inexperienced, it was V1's failure to stop for a stationary vehicle that directly caused the accident.
