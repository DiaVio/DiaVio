The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by reaching down to adjust the radio and failed to notice V2 (the 2005 Cadillac Deville) approaching the intersection. This distraction caused V1 to not see V2 until the last minute, leading to a collision between the two vehicles.
