The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to recognize that V2 was stopped in front of him or that the traffic signal was red in his direction. This indicates a driver-related error, specifically an unknown recognition error. As a result, V1 failed to stop and struck V2 in the rear, causing the accident.
