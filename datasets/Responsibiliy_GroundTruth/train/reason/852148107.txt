The reason for this is that V1 lost control on the icy bridge and began sliding into the oncoming travel lane, ultimately resulting in the head-on collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1989 Toyota 4x4 pickup truck. V1's loss of control and subsequent crossing into the opposite lane caused the collision, making it primarily responsible for the accident.
