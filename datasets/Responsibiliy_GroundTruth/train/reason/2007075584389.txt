The reason for this is that V1 swerved to the left to pass a non-contact vehicle that was double-parked in the eastbound travel lane, resulting in a collision with V2 (the driver of the 2001 Jeep Wrangler). V1's action of swerving into the oncoming travel lane was a violation of traffic rules and contributed to the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not see V2 due to the sun in her eyes. While this may have been a contributing factor, it does not absolve V1 of responsibility for swerving into the oncoming lane. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their improper lane usage and failure to adequately surveil the road before making the maneuver.
