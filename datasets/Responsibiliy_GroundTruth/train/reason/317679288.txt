The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign and lost control of the vehicle while attempting to brake on the wet road surface. This resulted in V1 sliding across the intersection, departing the roadway, and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's failure to stop and inability to maintain control of the vehicle contributed to the accident.
