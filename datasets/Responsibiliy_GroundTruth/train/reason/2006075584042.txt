The driver of V1 made an improper U-turn by entering lane two without ensuring it was clear of oncoming traffic. This is evident from the fact that V2 (the driver of the 2000 Toyota Camry) struck the left front of V1, indicating that V1 was in the path of V2's travel. Additionally, the driver of V1 was fatigued, having only had 3 hours of sleep the night before, which may have impaired her ability to properly assess the traffic situation and make a safe U-turn. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver failed to adequately check for traffic before initiating the turn. The driver's claim of turning her head to check for traffic but failing to use the rearview mirrors further supports this. On the other hand, the driver of V2, although familiar with the route and the vehicle, did not attempt any evasive maneuvers to avoid the collision. However, the critical reason was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2's actions did not contribute significantly to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to making an improper U-turn without ensuring it was safe to do so and failing to adequately check for traffic.
