The reason for this is that V2, driven by a 17-year-old inexperienced driver, made a left turn at the intersection without adequately surveilling the traffic. The driver falsely assumed that there was no moving traffic and proceeded to make the turn, failing to see V1 approaching in lane two. This decision error and false assumption of other's action led to the collision. Additionally, the wet roads and the fact that the impending problem was masked by the traffic flow pattern also contributed to the crash.
