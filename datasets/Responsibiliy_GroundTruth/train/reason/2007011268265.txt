The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn onto the roadway. Despite stopping and looking left, right, and left again, the driver did not see V2 approaching from her left until the last moment. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 accelerated and steered right in an attempt to avoid V2, which suggests a last-minute reaction that may have contributed to the collision. While the driver of V2 (the Pontiac Grand Am sedan) swerved left into lane two and applied the brakes, it can be argued that this evasive action was a result of V1's failure to yield the right of way. Therefore, V2's actions can be seen as a response to V1's mistake. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
