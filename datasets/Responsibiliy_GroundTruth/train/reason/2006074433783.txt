The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of Vehicle one was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle one either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming Vehicle two, resulting in the collision. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making a left turn.
