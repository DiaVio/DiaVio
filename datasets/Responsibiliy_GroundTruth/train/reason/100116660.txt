The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve and merging to the left. V1 ran off the right roadside, and despite attempting to steer left and right, the driver was unable to regain control. The vehicle then slid off the embankment, resulting in a rollover crash. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and stay on the roadway indicates that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
