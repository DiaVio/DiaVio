The driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by turning right from the incorrect lane without activating his turn signal. This decision error and failure to use the turn signal contributed to the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at his cousin's shop, which further impaired his ability to safely execute the turn. Therefore, V1's actions and violations of traffic laws make them primarily responsible for the accident.
