The driver of V1 stated that she thought the driver of V2 was crossing the centerline of the roadway. However, instead of maintaining control of her vehicle and taking appropriate action, she tapped the brakes and started to lose control, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as other performance error, specifically failing to control the vehicle for the weather conditions (ice and snow-covered road). This indicates that V1 did not adjust her driving behavior to match the road conditions, which contributed to the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 took the necessary avoidance maneuver by steering to the shoulder to try to avoid the collision. The critical reason for the critical event for V2 was not coded to the driver, indicating that he did not contribute to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to control the vehicle for the weather conditions and her improper response to the perceived actions of V2.
