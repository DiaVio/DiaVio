The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was asleep at the wheel, which was confirmed by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as "driver related factor; sleeping, that is, actually asleep." The driver's wife also mentioned that he has sleep apnea, is always fatigued, and falls asleep frequently. Additionally, V1 traveled off the left side of the roadway, indicating a lack of control and awareness while driving.
