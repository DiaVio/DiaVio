The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the tire blowout/complete tread separation that caused V1 to lose control and enter lane three. The investigation confirmed the presence of a tread separation on the left rear tire, which supports V1's statement. Additionally, the police report cited V1 for an improper lane change, further indicating that V1's actions contributed to the crash. V2 (the driver of the 2002 GMC Envoy) is not primarily responsible for the crash as there were no factors coded to suggest their contribution. They were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time when V1 skidded into their lane, and they were unable to avoid the impact due to the suddenness of the situation.
