The reason for this is that V-1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn onto the through street. The driver stopped for the stop sign and waited for approximately 15 seconds, but then proceeded into the intersection without properly checking for oncoming traffic. This resulted in V-1 turning in front of V-2 (the 1995 Toyota Tacoma pickup), causing the collision. V-2, on the other hand, was traveling within the speed limit and attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes and steering to the right. Therefore, V-2's actions do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident.
