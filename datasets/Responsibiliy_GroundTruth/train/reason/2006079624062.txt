The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the curve/turn, as stated by the driver himself. This is supported by the fact that V1 crossed over the lanes, mounted the curb, and made contact with the guardrail and chevron warning sign. The driver's mental condition, including depression, anxiety, and confusion, may have contributed to his inability to properly control the vehicle and make appropriate decisions while driving. Additionally, the lack of evidence of a pothole or other external factor suggests that the driver's excessive speed was the main cause of the collision.
