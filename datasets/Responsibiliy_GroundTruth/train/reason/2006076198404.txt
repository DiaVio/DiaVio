The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by his cell phone, which had fallen onto the passenger floorboard and began to ring. He looked down into the dark interior to locate and reach for his phone, causing his vehicle to depart the right road edge and ultimately collide with the guardrail. This internal distraction caused by the driver's actions directly led to the critical pre-crash event of the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle #1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
