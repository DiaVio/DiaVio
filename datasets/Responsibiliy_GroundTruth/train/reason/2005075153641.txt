The reason for V1's responsibility is that it failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the back of V2 (the 1994 RTD Gillig Bus). This is evident from the fact that V1's front contacted the back of V2, indicating that V1 was too close to V2 and unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, V1 deflected around the left side of the bus, suggesting that V1 was unable to stop or maneuver safely to avoid the collision. It is important for drivers to maintain a safe following distance, especially in wet conditions, to allow for sufficient time and space to react to any sudden changes in traffic. In this case, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance resulted in the collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
