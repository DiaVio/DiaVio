The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to pass V1 on the left side using the bicycle lane and parking lane, which is an illegal maneuver. V1, the driver of the Ford F550, stated that he did not see V2 attempting to pass him on the left side. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 was "Other vehicle encroachment from adjacent lane over right lane line," indicating that V2 was encroaching into the lane of V1. Furthermore, associated factors coded to V2 include traveling too fast for conditions, aggressive driving, and the wet roadway and weather conditions. These factors suggest that V2 was not driving with due care and caution given the road conditions. Overall, V2's illegal maneuver and failure to exercise caution in adverse weather conditions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
