The driver of V1 was traveling at a higher velocity than the traffic in front of him and failed to maintain a safe distance. This resulted in V1 impacting V2 from behind, pushing it into oncoming traffic and causing a chain reaction collision involving V3 and V4. The driver of V1 also swerved and struck the curb. The critical reason for the critical event of V1 was an unknown recognition error, indicating a failure to properly assess the gap and velocity of other vehicles. Additionally, traffic congestion and stop-and-go traffic were contributing factors.
