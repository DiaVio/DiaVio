The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to rapidly accelerate and maneuver onto the northbound roadway, disregarding the sidewalk and traffic islands. The driver then collided with a concrete retaining wall, resulting in a rollover and ultimately coming to rest upside down in the northbound roadway. This sequence of events indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not in control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, leading to the accident.
