The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway, specifically in regards to the presence of an elk crossing the road. This is evident from the critical reason for the critical event being coded as "inadequate surveillance." Additionally, the driver did not attempt any steering input to avoid the collision, despite having the option to use the paved shoulder or the southbound lane. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to properly observe the road and take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
