The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 decided to make a U-turn maneuver without ensuring it was safe to do so. V1 began to slow down and put on her right signal, indicating her intention to move to the shoulder. However, V2, the 2004 Toyota 4Runner behind V1, observed this and believed V1 was pulling to the curb. As a result, the driver of V2 changed lanes to the left and proceeded to pass V1 just as V1 began to negotiate the U-turn. V1's failure to ensure it was safe to make the U-turn and V2's subsequent collision with V1's left side, centered in the driver's door, indicates that V1 was primarily responsible for the accident.
