The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was driving too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of others, specifically the slowing traffic in front of her. This is evident from the fact that V1 struck the back of V2, indicating that she was unable to slow down enough to avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction while decelerating," further supporting the fact that V1 failed to adjust her speed accordingly. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and adjust her speed to the traffic conditions makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
