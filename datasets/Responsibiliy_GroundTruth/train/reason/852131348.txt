The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed from its designated lane and crossed multiple lanes, including the shoulder, before impacting the north side concrete barrier. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the fact that V1 rotated counterclockwise away from the barrier suggests that the driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle in time to prevent the collision.
