The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and turned right without yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the 1996 Mazda Protégé) was already in the intersection and had the right of way. V2 attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes, indicating that they were aware of V1's actions and tried to prevent the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
