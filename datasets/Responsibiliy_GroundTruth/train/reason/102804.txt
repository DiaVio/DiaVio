The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to completely clear the frost from her windshield, resulting in limited vision of the road. This failure to ensure clear visibility contributed to the driver not seeing Vehicle two (V2), the 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe, which was stopped at an angle and blocking the eastbound traffic lane. As a result, the front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in a T-type configuration, indicating that V1 was the striking vehicle. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was not using the available three-point seat belt, which may have contributed to the severity of her injuries. However, this does not absolve V1 of primary responsibility for the accident.
