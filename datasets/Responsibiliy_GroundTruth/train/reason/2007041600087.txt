The driver of V1 stated that a phantom vehicle cut into his lane, causing him to take evasive action by steering to the left and hitting the brakes. However, it is important to note that there is no evidence or confirmation of the phantom vehicle actually making contact with V1. The driver's evasive actions resulted in V1 losing control and colliding with the left concrete barrier wall, then crossing multiple lanes and ultimately colliding with V2 (the 2006 Toyota Camry) before hitting the right concrete barrier wall. Therefore, V1's actions of losing control and colliding with both barrier walls, as well as colliding with V2, indicate that they were primarily responsible for the crash.
