The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while merging onto the highway. The driver stated that she fishtailed unexpectedly and then steered right in avoidance, but ultimately lost control and rolled over. This indicates a lack of proper control and handling of the vehicle, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was traveling at a speed of 80 kmph (50 mph) according to the police report, which is above the posted speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph). This suggests that V1 was potentially driving too fast for the wet road conditions, further contributing to the loss of control. Furthermore, the driver's statement that she had just stayed up all night working on a school project and had only slept two hours in the previous 24 hours raises concerns about driver fatigue. Fatigue can impair a driver's alertness and reaction time, making them more prone to accidents. Overall, V1's loss of control, potential speeding, and driver fatigue indicate that the driver's actions and decisions were the primary factors leading to the crash.
