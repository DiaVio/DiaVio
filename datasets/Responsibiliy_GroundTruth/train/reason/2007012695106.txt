The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and failed to stop at the stop sign. This resulted in V1 sliding into the intersection and colliding with V2 (the Chevrolet Lumina). Additionally, V1's illegal maneuver of going through the stop sign further supports their primary responsibility for the accident.
