The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a decision error by sharply turning the steering wheel to the left at the last moment when she saw the ramp to the eastbound lanes. This caused her to lose control of the vehicle on the wet pavement and resulted in V1 hydroplaning and rotating counterclockwise, crossing multiple lanes and leaving the roadway. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the road and the dark and rainy conditions further contributed to the decision error.
