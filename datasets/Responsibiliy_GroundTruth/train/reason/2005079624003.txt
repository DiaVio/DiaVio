The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn onto the roadway and failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V1 stated that he looked to the left but did not see V2 (the 1995 Toyota Corolla sedan) prior to the impact. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision.
