The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by a cramp in her leg, which caused her to take her foot off the gas pedal and look away from the road. This distraction led to her not detecting the slower-moving V2 in time, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to traveling at a higher speed (96 kmph or 60 mph) than the posted speed limit (89 kmph or 55 mph), indicating a potential violation of the speed limit. Therefore, V1's distraction and potential speeding make them primarily responsible for the accident.
