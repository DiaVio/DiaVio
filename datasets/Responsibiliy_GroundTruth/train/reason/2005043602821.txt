The reason for this is that V1 entered the roadway and crossed in front of V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet S-10), causing V2 to strike the right side of V1. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, who was already traveling on the main roadway. Additionally, V1 admitted to being distracted by talking and singing with his passenger, which could have contributed to his failure to see V2 until the collision occurred. V2, on the other hand, was driving within his lane and had the right of way on the main roadway. He stated that he applied the brakes slowly to avoid causing a chain reaction of crashes. While V2 has a history of being involved in multiple crashes, there is no evidence to suggest that his actions or conditions contributed to this specific accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and being distracted while driving.
