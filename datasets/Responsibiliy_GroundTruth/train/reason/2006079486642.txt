The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the 23-year-old male driver of the Geo Prizm). V1 assumed that V2 would stop and allow her to proceed when the traffic signal turned from yellow to red. However, V2 continued through the intersection, resulting in the collision. V1's false assumption of V2's actions and failure to properly assess the situation led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible.
