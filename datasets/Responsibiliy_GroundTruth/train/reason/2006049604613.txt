The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was not paying attention and failed to identify the speed bump on the roadway. As a result, when the vehicle went over the speed bump, the driver made a steering movement to the right in an attempt to stabilize the vehicle, but ended up departing the roadway and causing the crash. Additionally, the driver's statement that she was trying to avoid hitting an unknown object suggests a lack of attention and awareness while driving. Therefore, the driver's poor directional control and failure to identify the speed bump make Vehicle one primarily responsible for the accident.
