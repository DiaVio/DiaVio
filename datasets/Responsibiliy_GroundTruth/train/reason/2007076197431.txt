The reason for this is that the driver of V1, an 18-year-old female, had consumed an unknown amount of alcohol and was unable to negotiate the curve on the road. The police report states that the driver missed the curve and drove in a straight path off the left side of the road. This indicates a lack of skill and control over the vehicle, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the presence of many beer cans in the vehicle suggests that the driver was impaired at the time of the crash.
