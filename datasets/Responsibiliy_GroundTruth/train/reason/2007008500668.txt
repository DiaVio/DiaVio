The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a significantly higher speed than the posted speed limit and too fast for the curve. The police reconstructionist estimated the speed to be around 129 kmph (80 mph), while the driver claimed to be traveling at approximately 80 kmph (50 mph). Additionally, the driver admitted to overcompensating in her steering, both to the left and to the right, which likely contributed to the loss of control and the vehicle crossing over into the opposite lane and off the roadway.
