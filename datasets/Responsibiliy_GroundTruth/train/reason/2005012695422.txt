The reason for this is that V2 made a decision error by misjudging the gap or the speed of V1. Despite seeing V1 down the road, V2 thought that there was enough time to pull out onto the roadway, resulting in the collision between the front of V1 and the right side of V2. While V1 was traveling at a high speed and had alcohol presence, which may have contributed to the accident, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to the driver of V1. Additionally, V2's decision error in misjudging the gap or speed of V1 was the immediate cause of the accident.
