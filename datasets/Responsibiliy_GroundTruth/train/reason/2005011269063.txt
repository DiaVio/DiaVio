The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign. Despite stopping for 5 seconds and checking for traffic, the driver proceeded to cross the intersection without ensuring it was clear. This action directly led to the collision with V2. Additionally, contributing factors such as internal distraction, concerns related to family and financial situation, and possible side effects from medication may have impaired the driver's ability to focus and make safe decisions while driving. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and the presence of contributing factors make them primarily responsible for the accident.
