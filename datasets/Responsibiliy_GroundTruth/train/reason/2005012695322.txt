The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an illegal maneuver by crossing the intersection while fatigued and without having slept for 27 hours. This decision error led to V1 entering the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver's preoccupation with being close to home and getting rest further contributed to the decision error. V2 (the driver of the 2000 Chevy Malibu) had the right of way and was traveling with a green light. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by applying brakes and steering left, indicating that V2 was attentive and reacted appropriately to the situation. The distraction caused by the improper restraint of the child in V2's vehicle does not absolve V1 of responsibility for the illegal maneuver and failure to yield the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
