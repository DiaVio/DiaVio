The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection, indicating a disregard for traffic rules. - V1 also failed to properly negotiate the turn, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and colliding with various objects. - Witnesses reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, suggesting excessive speed as a contributing factor. - The driver of V1 was inexperienced and driving with a suspended license, indicating a lack of proper qualifications and legal compliance. - Vehicle factors such as severely worn tires and missing pedal covers may have further compromised V1's control and braking ability. Overall, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign, inability to negotiate the turn, excessive speed, and driver-related factors make it primarily responsible for the crash.
