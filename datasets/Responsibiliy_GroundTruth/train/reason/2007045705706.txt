The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and reaching for a dropped drink at the time of the crash. This distraction likely caused her to fail to recognize the stopped garbage truck in front of her and resulted in the rear-end collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, which may have contributed to her inability to react appropriately to the situation. On the other hand, V2 (the 2000 International garbage truck) was stopped in the northbound lane as part of its regular trash route, and there were no contributing factors or critical reasons coded to this vehicle. Therefore, V2 does not bear primary responsibility for the accident.
