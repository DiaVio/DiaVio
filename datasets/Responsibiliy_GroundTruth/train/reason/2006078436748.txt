The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 70-year-old female, experienced an episode of syncope (temporary loss of consciousness) just prior to the crash. This medical condition impaired her ability to control the vehicle and keep it within the travel lanes, ultimately causing V1 to run off the left side of the roadway and collide with various objects.
