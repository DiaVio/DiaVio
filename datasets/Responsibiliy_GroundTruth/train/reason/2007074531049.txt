The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to the non-contact vehicle (NCV) in front of them and failed to respond to the NCV slowing down to turn right into a driveway. As a result, V1 steered left to avoid the NCV but ended up colliding with V2 (the 1998 Dodge Caravan) traveling in the opposite direction. Additionally, the minimal tread on the front tires of V1 and the wet road conditions were associated factors in this crash, indicating that V1's vehicle may not have been in optimal condition for safe driving in the given conditions. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. However, V2's inadequate surveillance was an associated factor, suggesting that V2 could have potentially taken more precautions to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to following too closely and failing to respond to the NCV's actions, while V2's inadequate surveillance contributed as an associated factor.
