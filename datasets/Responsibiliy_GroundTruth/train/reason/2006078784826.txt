The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was sleeping while operating the vehicle. This is evident from the critical reason coded as "sleeping" and the fact that the driver had no sleep within the last 24 hours. Additionally, the driver had worked an 8-hour shift and played softball for 2 hours the night before the crash, indicating fatigue and lack of rest. V1 departed from the southbound lane and entered the northbound lane, causing V2 (the 2000 Ford F-150) to take evasive action by steering to the left. However, when the driver of V1 woke up, they steered back into the southbound lane and locked up their brakes, resulting in a collision with the right side of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's sleeping while operating the vehicle, which led to the lane departure and subsequent collision.
