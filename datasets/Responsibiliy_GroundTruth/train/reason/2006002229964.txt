The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the rear of Vehicle #1. The driver of Vehicle #2 assumed that Vehicle #1 would merge without stopping, which was a false assumption. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 was looking to his left at approaching traffic and had inadequate surveillance, contributing to the collision. While the driver of Vehicle #1 did not take any avoidance actions, it is important to note that Vehicle #1 was stopped and waiting for a break in traffic, which is expected behavior at a yield sign. The driver of Vehicle #1 also had their foot on the brake and did not see Vehicle #2 coming up behind them. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance, false assumption of Vehicle #1's actions, and inadequate surveillance.
