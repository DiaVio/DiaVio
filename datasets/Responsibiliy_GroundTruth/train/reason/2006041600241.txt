The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when the motorcycle cut in front of him. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle, V1 swerved and hit the brakes, causing him to lose control and fishtail across multiple lanes of traffic. This overcompensation ultimately led to the collision with the concrete barrier wall. It is important to note that the motorcyclist's actions of cutting in front of V1 may have contributed to the situation, but ultimately, it was V1's overcompensation that resulted in the crash.
