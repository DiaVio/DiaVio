The reason for this is that V2 ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. V2 veered left to avoid the non-contact vehicle, but ultimately collided with V1. Additionally, after the impact, V2's driver and the 12 occupants attempted to flee, further indicating their responsibility for the accident.
