The reason for V4's primary responsibility is that it failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead and did not react appropriately to the slowing vehicles. As V2 and V3 began to decelerate due to ducks in the roadway, V4 failed to slow down in time and steered left, resulting in its front impacting V3's back. This initial impact set off a chain reaction, with V1 subsequently colliding with V4. V4's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the slowing vehicles led to the subsequent collisions and the serious injuries sustained by the case occupant in V1.
