The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was over-medicated, specifically with Vicodan and Soma, which played a major role in the crash. The driver's medical records and EMS records indicated that he could not stay awake and was shaky and unsteady on his feet. Additionally, the driver had a history of sleep apnea and chronic back pain, and reported getting only 3 hours of sleep at a time. These factors, combined with the driver's failure to stop for a previous crash, led to V1 departing the roadway multiple times, striking various objects, and ultimately colliding with a tree.
