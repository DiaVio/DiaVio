The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while entering the expressway. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor - too fast for conditions (wet roadway on a curve)." Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver did not possess a valid driver's license and refused an interview. These factors further contribute to the driver's responsibility for the crash.
