The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Impala) who was traveling straight in the westbound lane. V1 stated that she saw the large work vehicle with its right turn signal on and assumed the way was clear, but she did not see V2 until she had already entered the intersection. V2, on the other hand, stated that she did not see V1 stopped at the stop sign and as she passed the work truck, V1 entered her lane of travel and she could not avoid the collision. This indicates that V2 was not at fault as she was traveling straight and had the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection.
