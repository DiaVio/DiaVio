The reason for this is that V1 was traveling on the outside of the lane, which indicates that they were not driving within their designated lane. Additionally, V1 was distracted by adjusting the climate control panel, which is considered an internal distraction. V1 failed to notice that V2 (the 1992 Dodge 3500 Ram Van) was making a right turn and collided with the right rear of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to drive within their lane, combined with their distraction, resulted in the collision and makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
