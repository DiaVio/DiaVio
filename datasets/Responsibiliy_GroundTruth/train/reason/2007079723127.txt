The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by a mosquito inside the vehicle and swatted at it, inadvertently turning the steering wheel to the left. This internal distraction caused V1 to travel off the left side of the roadway and collide with the median jersey barrier. Additionally, the driver was traveling at a speed of over 113 kmph (70 mph), which was above the speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). The combination of the distraction and excessive speed contributed to the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
