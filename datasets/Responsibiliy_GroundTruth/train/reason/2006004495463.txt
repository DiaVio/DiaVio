The driver of V1 admitted to attempting an illegal left turn out of the shopping center, which directly led to the collision with V2. This illegal maneuver was the critical reason for the accident. Additionally, V1's aggressive factor of ignoring traffic control devices and the performance/experience factor of being an inexperienced driver further contribute to their responsibility.
