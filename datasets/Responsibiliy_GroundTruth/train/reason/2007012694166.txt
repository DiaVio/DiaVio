The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before pulling onto the roadway. She was distracted and her view was partially blocked by a large SUV waiting to turn into the restaurant parking lot. This led to her not noticing the oncoming Vehicle #2 in lane #2 and pulling out in front of it, causing the collision. Vehicle #2, on the other hand, was test-driving the vehicle and was not at fault for the accident. He was driving in his lane and had no time to react to Vehicle #1's sudden entry into his lane. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and distraction.
