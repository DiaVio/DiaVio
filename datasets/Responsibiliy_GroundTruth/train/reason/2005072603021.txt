The reason for this is that Vehicle one was turning left in front of an oncoming vehicle (Vehicle two, 1998 Ford Taurus SE). Vehicle two was going straight and was encroached upon by Vehicle one, which violated the right of way. Therefore, Vehicle one's left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic is the main contributing factor to the accident.
