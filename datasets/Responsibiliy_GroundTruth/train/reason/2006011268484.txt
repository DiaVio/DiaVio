The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding to turn left. She stated that she stopped at the stop sign, looked left and right, and waited for traffic to clear. However, she failed to look back left again before proceeding, which resulted in V2 (the 2005 Ford Taurus) colliding with the left side of V1 in the intersection. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within the speed limit and took appropriate actions to avoid the collision by braking and steering left. The driver of V2 also mentioned seeing V1 stopped at the stop sign and pulling out in front of her to turn left. Therefore, the inadequate surveillance by the driver of V1 led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
