The driver of V1 admitted to drifting to the right in an attempt to avoid hitting a cat that crossed the roadway. This action caused V1 to collide with the parked vehicle (V2) on the right side of the road. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, and the critical reason was coded as incorrect evasive action. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to control the vehicle and avoid colliding with the parked vehicle.
