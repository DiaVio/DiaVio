The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The driver of V1 stated that the sun was in his eyes, which may have contributed to his failure to see V2 (the 1999 Sterling cement truck) prior to the crash. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that they have a clear view of the road and any oncoming vehicles before making a turn. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in the correct lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. The driver of V2 was distracted by a bicyclist that turned left in front of him just prior to V1, but this distraction does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to properly surveil the intersection before making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
