The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed while overtaking another vehicle and entered into the opposite lane. This action indicates a violation of traffic rules and unsafe driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and began to brake, resulting in the rotation and subsequent rollover. The driver's loss of control further supports V1's primary responsibility for the accident.
