The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 suffered a blood clot/brain aneurysm, which caused him to lose consciousness before the crash. This physical impairment of the ability to act led to V1 drifting across the centerline into the southbound lane, resulting in the collision with V2.
