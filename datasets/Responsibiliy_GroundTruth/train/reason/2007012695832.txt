The driver of V1 turned left at the intersection without seeing V2 (the Buick Regal) approaching in lane one. V1 did not attempt any avoidance actions and collided with V2, causing a chain reaction that also involved V3 (the Honda Gold Wing motorcycle). The driver of V1 had an obstructed view due to the line of cars backed up in the second westbound lane, which was a driver-related factor contributing to the critical pre-crash event. Additionally, the driver of V1 was taking several prescription medications, which may have affected their ability to perceive and react to the situation.
