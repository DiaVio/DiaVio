The occupant of the Honda CRV was heavily loaded on the seat belt, suggesting that she was properly restrained at the time of the accident. The injuries sustained by the occupant, such as facial contusions from airbag deployment and contact with the A-pillar, spinal fractures resulting in cord transection, and multiple internal injuries, indicate a significant impact and force exerted on the vehicle. The fact that the driver reported trying to unbuckle the seat belt but found it extremely tight suggests that the driver may have been driving recklessly or negligently, leading to the severe loading of the seat belt and subsequent injuries to the occupant. Additionally, the intrusion and deformation of various parts of the vehicle, such as the door, toe pan, and glove compartment door, further indicate a significant impact. Therefore, based on the injuries sustained and the circumstances described, the driver of the Honda CRV (V1) is primarily responsible for the accident.
