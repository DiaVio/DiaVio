The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. The driver failed to look far enough ahead, was inattentive due to conversing with the passenger, and did not realize caution was required until it was too late. These factors indicate negligence on the part of V1, leading to the collision with the rear of V2.
