The reason for this is that V1 lost control while going around the left curve, crossed over the center line, and slid laterally into the opposite lanes, resulting in a direct lateral impact with the front of Vehicle Two (V2), the 1988 Toyota Corolla. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle while navigating the curve, leading to the collision.
