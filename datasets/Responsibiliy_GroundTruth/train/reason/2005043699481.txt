The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and had a recognition error. The driver admitted to looking down for a moment or two before realizing a crash was about to occur. This distraction caused her to fail to recognize the presence of V2 (the Ford Utilimaster postal van) in the same lane ahead of her. As a result, V1 rear-ended V2, causing the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported that sun glare had blinded her prior to the impact. However, the investigating officer found the driver's explanation less credible due to the time of day (early afternoon) and the fact that the police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 56 kmph (35 mph). This suggests that the driver's distraction and recognition error were the primary factors contributing to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
