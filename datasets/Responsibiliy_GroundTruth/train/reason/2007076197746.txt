The reason for this is that witness accounts indicate that V1 was traveling at a very high rate of speed, passing multiple vehicles in the number 2 lane. Witness one (W1) stated that V1's brake lights illuminated just before it began to fishtail, indicating that the driver was likely unable to maintain control of the vehicle due to excessive speed. Witness two (W2) also mentioned that V1 cut around him to the left and passed him at a high rate of speed before fishtailing and ultimately crashing into the embankment on the right side of the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to the police that they were traveling too fast and impacted the guardrail on the left. The police report also states that the driver had been drinking, which may have impaired their judgment and ability to safely navigate the curve. Therefore, based on the witness accounts, the driver's admission, and the presence of excessive speed and alcohol consumption, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
