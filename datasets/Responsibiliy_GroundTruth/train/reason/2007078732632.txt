The driver of V1 made a left turn across the path of V2 (the motorcycle) without adequately surveilling the intersection. The driver of V1 stated that she looked ahead before making the left turn but did not see the approaching motorcycle. This indicates that she failed to properly observe her surroundings and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the driver of V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and applied his brakes prior to the impact, suggesting that he was following the traffic laws and attempting to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
