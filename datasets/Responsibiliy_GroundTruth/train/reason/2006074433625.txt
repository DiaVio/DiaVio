The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and the vehicles in front of him. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This means that V1 did not properly look or failed to see that the other vehicles had stopped in front of him. As a result, V1 collided with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction where V2 then collided with V3, and V3 collided with V4. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain proper surveillance and avoid colliding with the stopped vehicles in front of them.
