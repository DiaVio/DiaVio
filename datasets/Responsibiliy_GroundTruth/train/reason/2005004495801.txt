The reason for V1's primary responsibility is a performance error, specifically poor directional control with skill ordinarily expected. This is indicated by the driver's statement that the wheel slipped from her hand, causing the vehicle to drift off the roadway and collide with a tree. Additionally, the driver's history of similar crashes in the past, as well as voluntarily surrendering her license until recently, suggests a pattern of poor driving skills or control. Furthermore, the associated factors of the driver's poor health, numerous medications, and conversing with the passenger may have contributed to the crash. These factors indicate potential impairments or distractions that could have further compromised the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle. Overall, based on the information provided, V1's performance error and potential impairments or distractions make her primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
