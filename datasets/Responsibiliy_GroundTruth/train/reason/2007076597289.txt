The reason for this is that V1 crossed the centerline multiple times, first with the left side tires, then with the right side tires, and ultimately collided with V2 (the 2005 Chevrolet delivery van). V1's poor directional control, aggressive driving, and potential overcompensation were identified as contributing factors. Additionally, the autopsy results indicated the presence of drugs in V1's system, which may have impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle.
