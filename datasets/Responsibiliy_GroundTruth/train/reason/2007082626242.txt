The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver of V1 stated that her view of V2 was obstructed by the intervening vehicles, but she still proceeded with the turn based on the assumption that lane one was clear. This assumption was incorrect, as V2 was traveling in lane one and was not seen by V1. V1 failed to exercise caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2.
