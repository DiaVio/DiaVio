The reason for this is that V2 lost control on the icy road surface and began a counterclockwise rotation, crossing the centerline and entering the path of V1. V1, the 2005 Buick LeSabre, was traveling in the correct lane and was unable to avoid the collision with V2. Therefore, V2's loss of control and crossing into the opposite lane caused the accident.
