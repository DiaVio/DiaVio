The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reaching down to change a CD while driving. This distraction caused V1 to cross into the westbound lane and ultimately collide with V2 (the 2000 Ford Focus) in the parking lot. The driver of V1 did not make any avoidance efforts, further indicating their negligence in maintaining control of the vehicle.
