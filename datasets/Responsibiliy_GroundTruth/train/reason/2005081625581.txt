The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that she felt something hit the left front wheel, which caused her to lose control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was poor directional control by the driver. Additionally, there was no visible damage to the tire or wheel, indicating that the driver's claim of hitting something in the roadway may not be accurate. Therefore, based on the driver's poor directional control and the lack of evidence supporting the claim of hitting something in the roadway, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
