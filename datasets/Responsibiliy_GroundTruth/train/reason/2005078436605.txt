The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a minimum calculated speed of 72 to 80 kmph (45 to 50 mph), which is significantly above the posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). - V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with V2, who was stopped for the red light. - The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking in the side mirror and not paying full attention to forward traffic. Therefore, V1's excessive speed, failure to maintain a safe following distance, and driver distraction are the primary factors that led to the rear-end collision.
