The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and the critical reason for the accident was determined to be "inadequate surveillance" on the part of the driver of V1. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2.
