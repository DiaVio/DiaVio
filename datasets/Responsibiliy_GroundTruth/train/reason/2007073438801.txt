The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver, who was an unlicensed fifteen-year-old female, was traveling with two sixteen-year-old passengers. She was in a hurry to get home before her mother woke up and was distracted by talking to and looking at her passengers. Additionally, she had only six months of driving experience and stated that she did not feel comfortable with her passengers. These factors, combined with her poor directional control and traveling too fast for the conditions (curved roadway with a radius of 50 meters), led to the loss of vehicle control and the subsequent crash.
