The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph). This is evident from the police reported travel speed of 80 kmph (50 mph) for V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 stated that V1 appeared to be traveling at about 121 kmph (75 mph). V1 also exhibited poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason driver related factor of "failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected." This is supported by the fact that V1 traveled into the eastbound lanes, skidded for about 14 meters (46 feet), and eventually collided with V2. Furthermore, there is no indication that V2 was at fault in this accident. The driver of V2 stated that he was traveling at about 25 mph in the #2 lane, well below the posted speed limit. He tried to avoid V1 by steering to the right, but V1 followed his vehicle and ultimately caused the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to speeding, poor directional control, and encroaching into the opposite lanes of travel.
