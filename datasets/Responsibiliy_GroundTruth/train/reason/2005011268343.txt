The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes to the right curb lane and proceeded through the intersection when the signal was amber. This indicates that V1 failed to stop at the intersection when it was required to do so. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported being fatigued at the beginning of the driving trip prior to the crash, which could have impaired their judgment and reaction time. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1994 Saturn SL) had stopped on the green light at the intersection for 3-5 seconds, waiting to turn left. V2 then accelerated from the stop and proceeded to turn left. The critical reason for the critical event for V2 was coded as a false assumption of other road user's actions, indicating that V2 may have assumed that V1 would stop at the intersection. However, V1's failure to stop at the amber signal and proceed through the intersection is a violation of traffic laws and is considered negligent/careless driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
