The reason for this is that V1, driven by an 89-year-old female, was turning left at the intersection and crossed directly into the path of V2, a truck traveling straight in the eastbound lane. The driver of V1 admitted to misjudging the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle, thinking she had enough time to make the left turn. V1 did not take any avoidance actions at the time of impact. On the other hand, V2, driven by a 26-year-old male, was traveling within the speed limit and attempted to steer right to avoid the collision but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1's misjudgment and failure to yield the right of way to V2 resulted in the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
