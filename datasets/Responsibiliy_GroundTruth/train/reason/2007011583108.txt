The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not notice that traffic in both lanes was stopped. This lack of surveillance led to V1 being unable to stop in time and subsequently colliding with the right side of V2 (the Mercury Sable). Contributing factors on the part of V1 include the driver's rotating work/sleep schedule, which may have affected his alertness and ability to react quickly. Additionally, the bug-splattered and dirty condition of the windshield, coupled with the sun's glare, may have further impaired V1's visibility. The rush hour traffic congestion caused by the construction zone ahead also played a role in the crash. On the other hand, V2 was stopped in traffic and did not contribute to the cause of the crash.
