The driver of V1 made a driver-related decision error by misjudging the gap distance between her vehicle and V2 (the driver of the Ford F150 pickup) while attempting to change lanes. This decision, along with traveling too fast for conditions and aggressive driving behavior, contributed to the crash. The driver of V1's excessive speed and rapid lane changes indicate a pattern of aggressive and hurried driving, which likely played a role in the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, had no formal driver education, and was not a licensed driver, further contributing to her responsibility for the accident.
