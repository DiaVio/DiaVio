The driver of V1 failed to notice V2 and V3 stopped in the road ahead of him because he was distracted by looking for the street sign to the left. This recognition error, combined with inadequate surveillance and the driver's lack of experience on the road, led to the collision. Additionally, the driver's discomfort with the higher speed limit on the road may have contributed to his inability to react in time to avoid the accident.
