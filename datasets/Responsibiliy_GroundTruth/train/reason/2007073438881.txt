The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through it. The driver admitted to being distracted by personal problems and stated that she thought she looked both ways but did not see V2 before entering the intersection. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the collision.
