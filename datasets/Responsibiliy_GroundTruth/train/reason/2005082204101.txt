The reason for this is that the witness stated that V1 had passed through the intersection at a high rate of speed, skidded, and then impacted the tree. Additionally, the vehicle had been reported stolen and was involved in an earlier shoplift. The driver of V1 also braked with lockup in the left curve, indicating a lack of control over the vehicle. Therefore, based on the witness account, the stolen vehicle report, and the driver's lack of control, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
