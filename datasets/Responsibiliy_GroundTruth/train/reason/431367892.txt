The reason for this is that V1 traveled across all four westbound lanes and off the west road edge, ultimately impacting a tree and rolling over before coming to a rest on its roof. The fact that the driver was unrestrained and not wearing a seatbelt contributed to the severity of her injuries. Additionally, the deployment of the steering wheel, seat back, and roof side rail airbags indicates a significant impact, suggesting that V1 was likely traveling at a high speed.
