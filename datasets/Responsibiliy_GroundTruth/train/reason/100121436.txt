The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had reportedly been making lane changes around slower moving traffic prior to the collision. V1 came up behind the slower-moving V2, the 1999 Sterling Tow truck, in the number-one lane without realizing the difference in their speeds. The driver of V1 possibly attempted to steer left to avoid the back of V2, resulting in the front of V1 striking the back of V2. Therefore, V1's driver's actions of making unsafe lane changes and failing to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front ultimately led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
