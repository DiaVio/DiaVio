The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to properly recognize the oncoming vehicle (V2) before making a left turn onto the roadway. The driver of V1 stated that he did not stop on the icy driveway, which was a recognition error. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions, indicating a lack of attentiveness to the traffic conditions. These factors contributed to the collision between V1 and V2.
