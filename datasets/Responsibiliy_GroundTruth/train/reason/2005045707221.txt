The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted internally, as indicated by the researcher finding a CD holder and miscellaneous music CDs on the floor of the driver's side of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated in his interview that the driver of Vehicle #1 had looked down into his seat right before the collision. The driver of Vehicle #1 was also coded as failing to look far enough ahead and being in a hurry. These factors suggest that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and failed to anticipate the deceleration of Vehicle #2, resulting in the rear-end collision.
