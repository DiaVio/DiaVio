The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, suggesting that V2 did not properly observe or adhere to traffic signals or signs. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate clockwise, further indicating that V2's actions were the primary cause of the collision.
