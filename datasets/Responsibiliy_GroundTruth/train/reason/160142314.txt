The reason for this is that V1 was traveling under snowy and icy conditions, which requires extra caution and slower speeds. However, V1 drove over ice and started rotating clockwise, indicating a loss of control. The driver then steered left, causing the vehicle to skid counterclockwise and cross over both lanes of the roadway. Ultimately, V1's right front and right rear tires struck the curb of the median. The primary responsibility lies with V1 because the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle under the given weather conditions, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver was unrestrained and had no airbags deploy during impact suggests a lack of safety precautions, which further contributes to V1's responsibility.
