The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2 (the GMC Envoy) while it was stopped at the intersection. V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, there is no indication that V2 made any sudden or unexpected movements that would have contributed to the accident. Although the presence of the police car traveling through the intersection on a red signal may have caused V2 to suddenly stop, V1 still had a responsibility to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to stop if necessary. Therefore, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
