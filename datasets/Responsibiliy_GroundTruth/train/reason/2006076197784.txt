The driver of V1 was distracted by a parked vehicle on the left side of the road and failed to pay full attention to the non-contact vehicle (the truck towing a boat trailer and boat) in front of her that was decelerating. This distraction caused her to not notice the truck braking for an animal in the roadway, resulting in her having to abruptly steer right and apply the brakes. As a result, V1 skidded off the right side of the road, rolled over, and came to rest on its top. The driver's external distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road and the vehicle in front of her led to the crash. Additionally, her discomfort with the way the vehicle handled and her previous statement that a rollover was bound to happen suggest a lack of familiarity and confidence in operating the SUV, which may have contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and lack of attention to the road and the vehicle in front of her.
