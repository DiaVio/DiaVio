The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated after the NC vehicle ran over an aluminum ladder that had fallen into the roadway. The driver swerved to the right, partially entering lane 1 and the right shoulder. However, V1 then came back to the left and departed the left roadside, resulting in a counter-clockwise yaw. This overcompensation and subsequent loss of control led to V1 tripping on its wheels and rolling to its right side. Additionally, the driver of V1 was following too closely to the NC vehicle due to rush hour traffic, which may have reduced her reaction time to the road hazard. The driver was also in a hurry to get to work, which could have contributed to her overcompensation and loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
