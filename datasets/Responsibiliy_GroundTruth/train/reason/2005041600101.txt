The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver attempted to make a left-hand turn without giving Vehicle #2 (the 1999 Toyota Camry) the right of way, even though Vehicle #2 also had a green light. This failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2 resulted in the collision between the front of Vehicle #1 and the left front side of Vehicle #2. Vehicle #1's driver admitted to not seeing Vehicle #2, indicating inadequate surveillance as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance.
