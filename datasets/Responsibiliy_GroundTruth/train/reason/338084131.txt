The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed from the road and entered a shallow ravine, ultimately colliding with two large diameter trees. The driver of Vehicle 1 was unbelted, as evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seat belt system. The lack of restraint use contributed to the driver's injuries and the severity of the impact.
