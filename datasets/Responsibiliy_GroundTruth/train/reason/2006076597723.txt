The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed the centerline and exited the eastbound traffic lanes, ultimately impacting a metal utility pole. Additionally, the driver tested positive for amphetamines, indicating possible impairment at the time of the crash. Witnesses also reported that the driver backed the vehicle up and hit the pole two more times after the initial impact. The driver's lack of memory of the crash further suggests a potential impairment or distraction. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
