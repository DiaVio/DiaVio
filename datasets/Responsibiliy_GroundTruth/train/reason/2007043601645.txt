The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was not paying attention, as indicated by the Critical Reason coded as inattention. This lack of attention caused V1 to collide with the back of V2 (the 1995 Ford Explorer) while V2 was decelerating to make a right turn. V1's driver stated that she could not remember any details about the crash and claimed that the truck "came out of nowhere," suggesting a lack of awareness of her surroundings. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
