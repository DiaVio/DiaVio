The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a left turn without properly judging the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle (V2). V1 admitted that she saw the other vehicle but thought it was further back from the intersection and believed that the other vehicle could get around her without hitting her car. This indicates a decision error and a misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle. Additionally, V1's age (83 years old) and health conditions may have contributed to her misjudgment. She wears prescribed glasses to correct her far-sightedness and has a hearing deficit with a 50% loss, even though she wears hearing aids. Furthermore, she takes medication for pain, high blood pressure, anti-inflammatory, thyroid, GERD, and high cholesterol, which have possible side effects of dizziness, sleepiness, and light-headedness. These factors could have impaired her ability to accurately assess the situation and make a safe left turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix) had a contributing factor of being too close to stop when the light turned yellow. However, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's improper left turn, and she attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes and steering left. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her decision error and misjudgment of the gap or the speed of the oncoming vehicle while making a left turn.
