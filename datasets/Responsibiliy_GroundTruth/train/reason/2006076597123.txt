The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a blowout or flat tire, which caused the vehicle to veer off the roadway and collide with the rock embankment. This indicates a failure of the vehicle's tires/wheels, which is considered a vehicle-related factor. The driver's statement that he was not in a hurry, familiar with the roadway, and driving at or around the speed limit suggests that his actions were not a contributing factor to the crash.
