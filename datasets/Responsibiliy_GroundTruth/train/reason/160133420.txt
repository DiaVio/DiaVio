The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it lost control in the snowy conditions, crossed the center line, and made contact with the front of Vehicle two (V2), the 2006 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan. This indicates that V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle in the prevailing weather conditions, leading to the collision.
