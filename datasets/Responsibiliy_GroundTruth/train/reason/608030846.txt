The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the junction and crossed the path of Vehicle 2 (a 1988 Olds Cutlass Ciera), resulting in the collision. Vehicle 1's failure to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 led to the impact and subsequent rotation of both vehicles. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not restrained by a three-point belt, which may have contributed to the severity of her injuries.
