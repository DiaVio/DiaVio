The reason for V1's responsibility is that she attempted to turn left at the intersection without properly ensuring that it was safe to do so. Despite the sun being in her eyes and having an obstructed view, she failed to take appropriate measures to avoid the collision. V1 did not decelerate enough or make any avoidance maneuvers, resulting in the collision with V2.
