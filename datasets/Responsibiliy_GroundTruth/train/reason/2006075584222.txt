The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one, a 15-year-old female, entered the intersection to make a left turn in front of Vehicle two (2004 Ford Expedition), which was already traveling straight through the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle one failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle two, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the driver of Vehicle one was identified as "inadequate surveillance," suggesting that the driver did not properly observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
