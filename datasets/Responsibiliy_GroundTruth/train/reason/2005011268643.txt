The reason for this is that the Critical Precrash Event coded for the driver of V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." This indicates that V1 crossed over into lane one of the highway, where V2 (the truck tractor) was traveling. The witness traveling behind the truck stated that V1 swerved in an apparent attempt to avoid contact with V2, suggesting that V1 was aware of the presence of V2 but failed to merge safely into the lane. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V1 was coded as 'unknown driver error.' Although the driver refused to give an interview and cited stress and lack of time, this does not absolve them of responsibility for the crash. The driver's failure to merge safely and maintain control of their vehicle ultimately led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, the driver of V2 reported that he observed V1 on the ramp pre-crash and thought the driver would slow to merge behind him. He also stated that he had no safe way to avoid contact with V1 due to vehicles in lane two. Therefore, while V2 may have been involved in the crash, the primary responsibility lies with V1.
