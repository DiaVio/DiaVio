The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver fell asleep while driving, which was determined to be the critical reason for the crash. The driver admitted to being overly tired in the days leading up to the crash, having worked 61 hours that week. The driver's lack of memory of the precrash events and the evidence of the vehicle departing its travel lane and overcompensating support the conclusion that the driver fell asleep at the wheel. This driver-related error of falling asleep while driving led to a loss of control and ultimately caused the rollover crash.
