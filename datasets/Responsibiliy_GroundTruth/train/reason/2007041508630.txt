The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and recognize that traffic was stopped in lane five. This recognition error, combined with the driver's emotional state of being upset after a meeting, contributed to the driver's decision to change lanes without fully assessing the situation. Additionally, the presence of rush hour congestion and the sightline restriction caused by traffic blocking the driver's view of V2 further contributed to the driver's failure to anticipate the stopped vehicles ahead.
