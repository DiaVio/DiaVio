The reason for this is that V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, meaning that the driver failed to properly observe the intersection before entering it. This is supported by the fact that V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and ensure it was safe to proceed resulted in the collision with V2 (the Toyota Corolla) and subsequent impact with V3 (the Chevrolet Trailblazer).
