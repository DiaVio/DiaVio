The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed into the southbound lane, went off the left side of the roadway, and struck several rocks and a pole. The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that she had avoided a squirrel that ran out in the roadway, but she does not remember anything after that until after she hit the pole. Additionally, the driver was described as being "out of it" by the police on the scene, possibly due to medications or fatigue. Medical personnel also indicated that she lost consciousness several times prior to arriving at the hospital. The driver had numerous medical problems and took several medications, including those for asthma and heart disease, which could have contributed to her impaired driving ability. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the circumstances surrounding the crash, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
