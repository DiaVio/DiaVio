The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, departed their lane to the right, and ultimately caused the series of events leading to the crash. This includes traveling across lane one, the paved shoulder, and departing the right side of the freeway. The impact with the embankment, shearing off the front left tire, and subsequent rollover were all a result of V1's initial loss of control. The final impact with V2 was a consequence of V1's rollover and movement back into the southbound lanes.
