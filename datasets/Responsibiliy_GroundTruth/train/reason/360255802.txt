The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted to change lanes to the right without ensuring that the lane was clear. This resulted in the driver having to brake and steer left, causing V1 to travel up onto a traffic island and ultimately collide with a pole. The driver's failure to properly check for other vehicles in the lane before changing lanes contributed to the crash.
