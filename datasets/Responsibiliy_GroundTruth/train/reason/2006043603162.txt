The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention and being inattentive, which was coded as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. The driver of V1 stated that she was driving at a "good distance" behind V2 (the 1999 Chrysler Town & Country) when it stopped without signaling. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and failed to anticipate the actions of the vehicle in front. Additionally, V1's driver blamed V2 for not using a turn signal before slowing down. However, it is the responsibility of the following driver (V1) to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop or slow down if the vehicle in front makes any sudden movements. Therefore, based on the driver's inattention and failure to maintain a safe following distance, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
