The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1 (2008 Chevrolet HHR 4-door wagon) as both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time. Vehicle 2 continued to push Vehicle 1 sideways, causing damage to Vehicle 1's right side wheels/rims. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, resulting in the collision.
