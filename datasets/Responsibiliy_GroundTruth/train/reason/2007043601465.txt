The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he was driving at a speed of 121 kmph (exceeding the posted speed limit of 105 kmph) and was unable to respond effectively to the unexpected actions of the merging red car (NCV). V1's excessive speed and failure to realize the need for caution in the situation contributed to his loss of control and subsequent collision with the guardrail. Additionally, the insufficient steering and braking by V1 further indicate his responsibility for the crash.
