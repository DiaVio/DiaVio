The driver of V1 admitted to drinking and feeling "drunk" at the time of the collision. This indicates that the driver was impaired and likely unable to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a relatively low speed, suggesting that the driver's impairment was a significant contributing factor to the vehicle departing the roadway and striking the fence post.
