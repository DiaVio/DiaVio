The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1 (2007 Dodge Caliber 4-door hatchback) in a near-side impact. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was already in the intersection. Vehicle 2's failure to yield resulted in the collision and subsequent chain of events, including Vehicle 1 rotating out of the impact, striking various objects, and ultimately coming to rest at a tree.
