The reason for V1's responsibility is that the brakes of the vehicle failed, causing it to drift off the right side of the roadway and collide with a tree. The driver of V1 stated that she pressed the brakes firmly but they did not work, resulting in the loss of control of the vehicle. The critical precrash event for V1 was the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason for this event was the failure of the brakes. It is important to note that the driver of V1 is an 82-year-old female who sustained moderate injuries and was transported to a local hospital. However, the case summary states that her medications and familiarity with the roadway were not thought to have contributed to the crash.
