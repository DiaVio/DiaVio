The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was attempting to execute a left turn from the eastbound left turn lane, while Vehicle 1 (2013 Volkswagen Jetta GLI 4-door sedan) was proceeding straight through the intersection in the westbound outboard through lane. As both vehicles entered the intersection, the front right surface of Vehicle 1 impacted the right side of Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, Vehicle 2's left turn maneuver was the contributing factor to the accident.
