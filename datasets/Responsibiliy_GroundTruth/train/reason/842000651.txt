The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating a left curve. The driver initially steered left to return to the roadway but then made a hard right steering maneuver, causing the vehicle to depart the right side of the roadway again. This ultimately led to a left side impact with a large tree, resulting in severe damage to Vehicle 1 and serious injuries to the driver.
