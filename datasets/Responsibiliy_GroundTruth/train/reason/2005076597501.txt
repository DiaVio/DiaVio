The driver of V1 saw a group of rocks on the roadway and attempted to avoid them by steering right off the road edge. However, when the driver steered left back onto the roadway, they overcompensated, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise. The driver's subsequent hard right steering further exacerbated the rotation, ultimately leading to the vehicle tripping and rolling. This sequence of events suggests that the driver's overcompensation and improper steering inputs were the main factors contributing to the crash.
