The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit (97 kph or 60 mph) on a downhill grade, which may have contributed to the driver's inability to stop or avoid the collision with V3. Additionally, V2 swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid impact with V3, indicating a lack of control or proper judgment by the driver. The collision with V1 in a head-on configuration further suggests that V2 was not able to safely navigate the roadway.
