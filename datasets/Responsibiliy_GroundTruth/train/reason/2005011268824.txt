The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to turn left across the path of V2 without adequately surveilling the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving on a suspended license and failed to come to a full stop at the stop sign before making the left turn. These actions demonstrate negligence and a disregard for traffic laws, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
