The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 broke traction on the slick road surface, causing it to rotate clockwise and cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1995 Chevrolet Tahoe 4-door 4x4 sport utility). This action by Vehicle 1 initiated the collision and resulted in severe damage to both vehicles.
