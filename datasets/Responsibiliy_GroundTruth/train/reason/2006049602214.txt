The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an inadequate surveillance and failed to see if lane one of the northbound lanes was free before attempting the left turn. The driver assumed that the oncoming traffic still had a red light because it was stopped in lanes two or three. This assumption was incorrect, and V1 proceeded with the left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so.
