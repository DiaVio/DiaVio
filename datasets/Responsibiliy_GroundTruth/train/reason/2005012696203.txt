The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a lane change without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane, resulting in a collision with V2. The driver of V1 reported that she did not see V2 because it was in her blind spot, indicating a recognition error and inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she was unfamiliar with the road, which may have contributed to her failure to properly assess the traffic situation.
