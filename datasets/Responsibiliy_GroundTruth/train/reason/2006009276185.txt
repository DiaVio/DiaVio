The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to turn left (eastbound) while Vehicle 2 (the 2003 Saturn Vue) was traveling northbound. Vehicle 1's front contacted Vehicle 2's left front, indicating that Vehicle 1 turned in front of Vehicle 2, causing the collision. The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that he assumed the driver of Vehicle 2 was stopping for the light, but she did not stop and hit him. This indicates a decision error on the part of the driver of Vehicle 1, as he made a false assumption about the actions of the other driver. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle 2 stated that Vehicle 1 tried to turn before she could continue straight, resulting in the collision. However, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that Vehicle 2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error in making a false assumption about the actions of the other driver.
