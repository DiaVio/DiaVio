The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was driving under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of 0.12, which impaired his judgment and reflexes. - V1 accelerated to 97% throttle when turning left, indicating a misjudgment of the speed and gap distance of Vehicle Two (V2). - V1's acceleration and attempt to avoid a collision with V2 resulted in a collision with Vehicle Three (V3). - V1's impaired state, poor vision (according to his daughter), and lack of familiarity with the roadway (monthly travel) contributed to his inability to safely navigate the intersection. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and misjudgment of the situation make him primarily responsible for the accident.
