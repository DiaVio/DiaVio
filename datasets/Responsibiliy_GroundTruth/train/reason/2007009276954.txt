The reason for this is that V2 made a false assumption that V1 would stay in the second lane of travel behind the stopped van. V2 turned left at the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so, and failed to notice V1 switching lanes to pass the van. This resulted in V2 turning in front of V1, causing the collision. Additionally, the witness statement supports the fact that V2 approached the intersection at a high rate of speed and quickly switched lanes, further indicating that V2 was not exercising proper caution and awareness while making the left turn. Therefore, V2's failure to properly assess the situation and make a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
