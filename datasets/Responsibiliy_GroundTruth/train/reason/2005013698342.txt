The driver of V1 was distracted by reaching into the back seat to retrieve a bottle of lighter fluid, which caused her to veer off the roadway to the right. Additionally, when she attempted to correct her course, she overcompensated by steering hard to the left and then back to the right, resulting in a loss of control and the vehicle overturning. Insufficient braking and steering inputs also contributed to the crash.
