The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when trying to avoid a potential collision with another vehicle. The driver stated that he saw a car coming up from behind at a high rate of speed, causing him to panic and steer right onto the white fog edge line. This sudden maneuver led to the vehicle going over cinder gravel and losing control, resulting in a counter-clockwise rotation and ultimately crashing into a drainage ditch. The driver's overcompensation and panic reaction contributed to the loss of control and subsequent accident. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the vehicle's handling characteristics and the fact that he had been driving for over two hours may have also played a role in his inability to properly control the vehicle in this situation.
