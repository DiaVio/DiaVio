The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that she was traveling and observed traffic ahead, but her vision was obscured by sun glare. This indicates that she was aware of the traffic situation but failed to adjust her speed or take appropriate measures to avoid a collision. Additionally, V1's speed at the time of the crash was reported to be 37 kmph, which suggests that she was traveling too fast to respond to the unexpected actions of others, specifically the congested traffic due to the lane closure. V2 (the 1996 Honda Accord) is not primarily responsible as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was not coded to this vehicle.
