The reason for this is that V1 was reported to be "weaving in and out of traffic" and traveling at a high speed of 113-129 kmph (70-80 mph). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side, indicating that V1 veered right towards the exit lanes. This aggressive driving behavior and lane deviation ultimately led to the collision with V2 and V3.
