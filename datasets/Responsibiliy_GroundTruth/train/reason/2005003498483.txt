The driver of Vehicle #1 stated that they lost control on the ice patch, indicating that they were aware of the hazardous road conditions. The critical reason for the crash was coded as an environment-related factor, specifically slick roads, and an associated factor coded to the driver was a decision error of traveling too fast for conditions and not realizing that caution was required. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision to travel at a speed that was not appropriate for the icy road conditions.
