The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle and veered off the roadway, ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's inconsistent and false statements about the cause of the crash, along with the evidence found at the scene (such as condoms, unbuttoned pants, and an open wallet with cash falling out), suggest that the driver may have been distracted or engaged in inappropriate activities while driving. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with both the roadway and the rental vehicle, which could have contributed to the recognition error that led to the crash.
