V2 was turning left at an intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the turn. This resulted in V1, who was attempting to pass another vehicle, colliding with V2 on the left side. V1 stated that he was not aware that V2 was going to turn when he started his passing maneuver, indicating that V2 did not provide sufficient warning or indication of her intention to turn left.
