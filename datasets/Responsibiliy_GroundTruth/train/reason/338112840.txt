The reason for this is that V1 was negotiating a right curve on a suburban roadway and lost control, resulting in a yaw and traveling off the roadway. V1 then impacted a landscaping border and continued to collide with a tree before coming to a rest. The driver of V1 sustained serious injuries, indicating that she was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's loss of control.
