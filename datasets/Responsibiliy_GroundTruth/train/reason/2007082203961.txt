The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she ran a red light and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Colorado pickup truck). V1 falsely assumed that V2 would yield to her, even though V2 had the right of way. This false assumption of other's actions led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was distracted by talking on her cell phone to her boyfriend and was also thinking about financial problems. These distractions likely contributed to her failure to properly observe the traffic signal and the approaching V2. On the other hand, the critical reason for V2's involvement in the collision is not provided in the case summary, and no interview was obtained with V2. Therefore, without further information, it cannot be determined if V2 bears any responsibility for the collision.
