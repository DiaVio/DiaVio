The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. This decision error led to the collision with V2. Additionally, the sightline restriction caused by a corner building may have contributed to the driver of V1 not being able to see V2 clearly. However, since V2 was traveling on a road controlled by a stop sign, it is expected that V1 should have yielded the right of way to V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
