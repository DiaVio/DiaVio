The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was crossing through the intersection. V2's false assumption of V1's actions, assuming that V1 would yield the right of way, led to the collision. Additionally, V2 stated that his view of V1 was initially blocked by another vehicle, indicating a lack of proper observation and awareness before making the turn.
