The reason for this is that V1 was traveling eastbound in the left turn only lane and turned left across traffic in front of V2 (the driver of the 1991 Subaru Legacy station wagon). This action violated the right of way of V2, who was traveling westbound and entered the intersection on a green light. Therefore, V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic and make a safe left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
