The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V2 claimed to have checked traffic to the left but did not see any vehicles coming. However, the driver's poor surveillance resulted in her not seeing V1 approaching from the westbound lane, leading to the collision. Additionally, the driver's husband mentioned that she was uncomfortable with the intersection due to the stop sign being set back too far and the presence of speeding dump trucks. However, these factors do not absolve V2 of responsibility for not properly checking for oncoming traffic before entering the intersection.
