The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the wet roadway conditions, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that V1 swerved left across the median and into oncoming traffic indicates a lack of proper control and awareness on the part of the driver. The aftermarket tires and rims, as well as potential braking and overcompensation, may have also contributed to the crash.
