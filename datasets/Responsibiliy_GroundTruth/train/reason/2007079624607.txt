The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to change lanes to avoid a slower vehicle in her lane. This loss of control was due to driver-related factors, including inattentiveness caused by talking with a passenger and fatigue from lack of sleep. Additionally, the driver did not have her headlights on, although the tunnel was lighted overhead. These factors contributed to V1 departing from the left side of the roadway and colliding with the tunnel wall.
