The driver of V1 was distracted by looking in his left side mirror while attempting to make a lane change. This distraction caused him to veer off the roadway to the right and collide with V2, a disabled vehicle parked legally on the right shoulder. The driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead to see the disabled vehicle and did not exercise proper caution while changing lanes. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to careless driving and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
