The driver of V1 admitted to not being able to provide a reason for why he hit the back of V2, who had stopped at the stop sign in front of him. V1 was cited for failure to use due care and failure to stop at a traffic control device. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V1 was identified as driver-related error, unknown recognition, indicating that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of him. On the other hand, V2 was following the rules of the road by stopping at the stop sign and looking both ways before proceeding. The driver of V2 had no reason to expect being hit from behind. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to recognize and stop in time to avoid hitting the back of V2.
