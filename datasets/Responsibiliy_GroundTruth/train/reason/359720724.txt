The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling straight in the southbound lane and failed to avoid colliding with the back left of the stopped transit bus (V2). V1 sustained underride type damage as it went under the back of the bus bumper, indicating that V1 was unable to stop or maneuver in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was determined to be not belted, which suggests a lack of proper safety precautions. This could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained by the driver of V1. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to avoid colliding with the stopped transit bus and the driver's lack of seatbelt usage.
