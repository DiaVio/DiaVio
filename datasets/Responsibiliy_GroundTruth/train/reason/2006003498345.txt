The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to make a left turn into a driveway, crossing the path of V2 (the Buick Regal) which was traveling in the opposite direction. V1 did not have the right of way to make the left turn, and the driver's statement that V2 was far away when she began to turn left indicates a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic. This resulted in the front impact between V1 and the left side of V2.
