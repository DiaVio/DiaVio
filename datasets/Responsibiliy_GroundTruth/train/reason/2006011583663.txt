The driver of V1 was inexperienced, having only been driving for 5 weeks, and had recently transitioned from driving a small car with an automatic transmission to the Jeep with a manual transmission and stiffer suspension. This lack of experience with the vehicle and its handling characteristics likely contributed to the driver's poor directional control. Additionally, the driver was attempting to downshift while going uphill and was not able to adequately control the vehicle, leading to it veering off the road and impacting a tree. The driver's inadequate/incorrect evasive actions further indicate a lack of skill and control. Furthermore, the deteriorated condition of the roadway, with its rough and washboarded surface, may have exacerbated the driver's difficulty in maintaining control of the vehicle. The combination of the driver's inexperience, inadequate evasive actions, and driving too fast for the conditions, along with the vehicle's underinflated tires, ultimately make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
