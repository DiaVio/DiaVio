The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to yield at the intersection. The driver admitted to taking her eyes off the road while looking for an address, and when she looked forward again, the traffic light had already turned red. This indicates a recognition error and external distraction on the part of the driver of Vehicle #1. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with failure to yield by the police. While Vehicle #2 (1995 Chevrolet Lumina) was struck by Vehicle #1, the driver of Vehicle #2 had the right of way as she approached the intersection with a green light. There were no associated factors coded to the driver of Vehicle #2, indicating that she was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to the driver's failure to yield and external distraction.
