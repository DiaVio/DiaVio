The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at her child in the backseat and not seeing the light change. This distraction caused her to enter the intersection and collide with V2 (the 1999 Buick LeSabre) while it was making a left turn. Additionally, V1 violated a traffic control device by entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so. V2, on the other hand, was stopped at the intersection and entered the intersection when the light turned green, which is a normal and expected maneuver. The driver of V2 was not believed to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction and violation of a traffic control device, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
