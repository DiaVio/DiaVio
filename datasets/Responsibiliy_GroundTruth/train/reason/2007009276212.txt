The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 changed lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. The driver stated that he saw vehicles exiting out of the church parking lot into lane 1, so he decided to change to lane 2. However, while changing lanes, he failed to notice V2 attempting to make a U-turn. As a result, V1 struck V2, causing the crash. Additionally, the witness on the bus reported that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, which suggests that V1 may have been exceeding the posted speed limit. This further supports V1's responsibility for the crash. It is important to note that the high rate of U-turns at the intersection and the dangerous situation they create were contributing factors to the crash. However, V1's failure to yield the right of way to V2 and change lanes without proper observation make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
