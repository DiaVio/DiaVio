The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve. This is evident from the fact that V1 departed the roadway to the right and struck a mailbox, indicating a loss of control. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) suggests that the driver was exceeding the posted speed limit for the curve. The driver's high BAC level of 0.147 also indicates impaired judgment and reaction time, further contributing to the driver's responsibility for the crash.
