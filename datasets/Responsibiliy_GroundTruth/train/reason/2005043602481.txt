The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a heart attack or other physical impairment, likely due to her history of seizures and the use of seizure medication. This impairment caused her to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in her departure from the roadway, crossing the grass median, and ultimately crashing into multiple trees and the bridge overpass. Additionally, the driver's distraction from talking on her handheld mobile phone may have contributed to her missing the exit and further exacerbating the situation.
