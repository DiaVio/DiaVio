The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn directly behind the non-contact vehicle without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V1 falsely assumed that V2 (the driver of the Toyota pickup) would stop, even though V2 had the right of way with a green light. This false assumption of V1's actions led to the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the associated factor of V1 being in a hurry may have contributed to their inattention and failure to properly assess the situation before making the left turn.
