The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made an error in judgment by attempting to turn right to avoid the oncoming vehicle that was making a left turn in front of them. This decision was made despite the presence of a pedestrian with a baby carriage in the crosswalk, which obstructed the driver's view. The driver's decision to turn right in this situation ultimately led to them losing control of the vehicle and colliding with a sign pole and a bus stop shelter. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error in judgment and failure to properly assess the situation before making a maneuver.
