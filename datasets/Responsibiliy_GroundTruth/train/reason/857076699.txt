The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curved roadway, leading to a series of steering maneuvers and oversteering. This resulted in Vehicle 1 entering the median, tripping, and rolling into the westbound travel lanes. The driver's loss of control and subsequent rollover ultimately caused the accident.
