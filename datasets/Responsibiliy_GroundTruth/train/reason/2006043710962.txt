The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, exceeding the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). - V1 departed the right side of the roadway, struck a mailbox, and then crossed over the double yellow lines multiple times. - V1's driver made no attempt to slow down the vehicle after the first harmful event and even accelerated where braking would be expected. - The driver was found to have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .25, well above the legal limit. - The driver was also reported to be a known drug abuser and had various over-the-counter medications in the vehicle. - The driver had a history of risky behavior, including a severe head injury that resulted in memory loss and difficulty differentiating between right and wrong. - The driver's parents reported that he suffered from significant stress, fatigue, and an undiagnosed sleep disorder. These factors, including excessive speed, aggressive driving, alcohol impairment, drug abuse, and the driver's physical and mental condition, all contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
