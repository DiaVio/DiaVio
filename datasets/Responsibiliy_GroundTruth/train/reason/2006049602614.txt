The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was attempting a left turn without a protected left turn arrow, indicating that they did not have the right of way. - V1 did not stop at the intersection and proceeded with the left turn at a low rate of speed. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn, as they did not see V2 approaching. - The witness accounts suggest that V1 may have been attempting a U-turn, which would further indicate a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver. Overall, V1's failure to stop at the intersection, inadequate surveillance, and potential improper maneuvering make them primarily responsible for the accident.
