The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without properly assessing the situation and failed to look to her left to see V2 (the driver of the 2003 Nissan Xterra). V1 was distracted by conversation with her right-front passenger, which was identified as an internal distraction. This distraction caused her to be unaware of V2's presence and ultimately resulted in the collision between V1 and V2.
