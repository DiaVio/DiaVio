The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the crash occurred when V1 was traveling northbound in the right center lane and a passenger in the 2nd row left seating position grabbed the steering wheel and directed V1 to the left, causing it to impact the concrete divider. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to the actions of the passenger, resulting in the crash and subsequent rollover.
