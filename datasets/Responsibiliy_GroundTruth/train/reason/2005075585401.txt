The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was asleep at the wheel, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event being coded as "driver related factor: sleeping, that is, actually asleep." Despite being tired from working overtime, the driver refused the passenger's offer to drive, resulting in him falling asleep while driving. This led to V1 veering off the road, striking delineator posts, and ultimately rolling over.
