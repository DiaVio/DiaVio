The driver of V1 admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming while driving. She stated that she didn't notice that V2 had stopped in front of her. Additionally, she mentioned experiencing road hypnosis, as this was her regular commute route. Despite the possible obstruction of brake lights due to sunglare, an attentive driver would have noticed the abrupt stop of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front.
