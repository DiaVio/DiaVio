The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver, a 16-year-old female with only 3 months of driving experience, was distracted by looking down at the radio. This distraction led to a recognition error and a performance error of overcompensation, causing the vehicle to veer off the road and ultimately collide with a utility pole. Additionally, the driver was in a hurry to get to cross-country practice, which may have contributed to her distracted driving. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inexperience, distraction, and overcompensation.
