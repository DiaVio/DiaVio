The reason for this is that V1 was reported to be traveling at a speed of 96 km/h (60 mph) in a 48 km/h (30 mph) speed limit zone. This indicates that the driver was exceeding the speed limit by a significant margin. Additionally, V1 lost control and departed the roadway, indicating a lack of proper control and caution by the driver. The impact with two trees on both sides of V1 further suggests that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle.
