The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 drifted left over the double yellow lane lines, entering the opposite lane of travel and striking the left side of V2. This indicates that V1 was not in its designated lane and was driving in a reckless or negligent manner. Additionally, the driver of V1 reported experiencing health problems, including feeling as if he were going to faint just prior to the crash. This suggests that the driver's physical impairment and potential loss of consciousness contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in its designated lane and did not notice anything unusual about V1 until it entered her lane and struck her vehicle. While driver inexperience was coded as an associated factor for V2, it does not appear to be the primary cause of the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to drifting into the opposite lane and potentially experiencing a near fainting episode.
