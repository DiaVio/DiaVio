The reason for this is that V2 was exiting the driveway and intending to turn left onto the roadway. The driver of V2 made a false assumption about the actions of the lead vehicle in lane one, who signaled that it was clear to exit the driveway. However, V1 was still approaching in lane two, and V2 failed to properly assess the situation and collided with V1. Therefore, V2's false assumption of the lead vehicle's actions and failure to properly yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
