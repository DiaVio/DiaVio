The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that she was distracted by looking at an extraneous vehicle in her rearview mirror, which caused her to not pay attention to the traffic ahead of her. This distraction led to her entering the intersection and colliding with V1, who was making a left turn. V2's recognition error and external distraction contributed to the accident.
