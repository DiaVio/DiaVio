The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that V2 (the 1984 Chevrolet Cavalier) was not moving and collided with the rear of V2, pushing it into the left turn lane. V1's critical reason for the critical event was a driver-related factor, specifically a recognition error where the driver was focused on an extraneous vehicle (the white van) and failed to recognize the stationary V2 in front of them. Additionally, associated factors such as following too closely to the vehicle ahead and traveling too fast for the roadway indicate that V1 was not exercising proper caution and was potentially in a hurry, which contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them and their driving behavior.
