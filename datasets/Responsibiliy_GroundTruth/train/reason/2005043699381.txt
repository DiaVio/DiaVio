The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that V1 changed lanes abruptly and aggressively to avoid slowing down behind a truck turning right into the shopping center. This sudden lane change resulted in V1 turning left into the path of Vehicle two (V2), which was already waiting to turn left. V1's aggressive driving behavior and failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision. In contrast, V2's primary responsibility is limited to the fact that their view of V1 was obscured by the truck. However, V2 had already initiated their left turn and was waiting for a clear path before V1 suddenly passed the obscuring truck. V2's actions were reasonable given the circumstances, and the main cause of the accident lies with V1's aggressive lane change and failure to yield. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their aggressive driving behavior and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
