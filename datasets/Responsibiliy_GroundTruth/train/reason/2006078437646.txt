The reason for this is that the tread on the left rear tire of V-1 apparently began to separate, causing the vehicle to lose control and rotate counterclockwise. V-1 then struck a guardrail with its right rear and right front areas before coming to rest in the eastbound lane. The fact that the right front tire detached from the vehicle during the impact further indicates a failure of the vehicle's tires/wheels. Therefore, V-1 is responsible for the crash due to the tire failure and subsequent loss of control.
