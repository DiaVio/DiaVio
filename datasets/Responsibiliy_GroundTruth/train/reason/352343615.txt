The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 initiated a U-turn from the east shoulder area, heading north, without yielding to oncoming traffic. As a result, Vehicle 2 (the 2008 Chevrolet Uplander minivan) was unable to avoid a collision and struck the left side of Vehicle 1 in the southbound travel lane.
