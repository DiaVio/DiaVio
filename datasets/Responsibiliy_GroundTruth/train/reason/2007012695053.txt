The driver of V1 stated that there was a vehicle in front of him that made a sudden lane change back onto the highway and slowed down in front of them. In an attempt to avoid contacting that vehicle, the driver of V1 made a lane change to the left without adequately checking for other vehicles, including V2. This lack of adequate surveillance and failure to see V2 resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to look properly before changing lanes.
