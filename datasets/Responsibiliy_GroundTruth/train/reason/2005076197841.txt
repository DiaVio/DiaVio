The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to not paying attention and was passing through the intersection while the light was red. This indicates a clear violation of traffic laws and a lack of attention to the road. Vehicle #1's movement was coded as "going straight" and the critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling, crossing through intersection". The critical reason for this event was coded as "inattention". On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (1994 Toyota Camry) was stopped in the traffic lane and was beginning to turn left with a green light in the opposite direction of Vehicle #1. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, opposite direction". However, the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that Vehicle #2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inattention and violation of traffic laws.
