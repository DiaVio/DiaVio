The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn from a business driveway onto the westbound lanes of the roadway, misjudging the gap or the speed of V2 (the Saturn). V1 stated that she saw V2 approaching but believed she had enough time to clear the westbound lanes with the trailer and boat. However, V2 was unable to avoid contact with the trailer of V1, indicating that V1 did not give V2 enough time or space to safely pass. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 had limited experience pulling a boat and had only driven the vehicle a few times in the last 3 months. This lack of experience and familiarity with the vehicle may have contributed to the misjudgment of the gap or speed of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the misjudgment of the gap or other's speed while attempting the left turn.
