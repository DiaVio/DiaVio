The reason for this is that the driver of vehicle one failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to not seeing vehicle two prior to the collision, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. Additionally, the investigating officer cited "inexperience" as a contributing factor for vehicle one, suggesting that the driver may not have been sufficiently skilled or experienced to handle the situation. While vehicle two (the 1994 Toyota pickup) did not realize that vehicle one was turning until it was too late to avoid a crash, the primary responsibility lies with vehicle one for not properly observing the intersection and yielding to oncoming traffic. In summary, the driver of vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and inexperience.
