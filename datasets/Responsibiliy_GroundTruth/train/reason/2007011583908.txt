The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 made an illegal maneuver by passing the non-contact vehicle on the left and turning right at the intersection, which caused V1 to enter the lane of V2. - V1 was driving a stolen vehicle and was unfamiliar with the area, which may have contributed to his aggressive driving behavior and the distraction of trying to get away quickly. - V1 was unlicensed and inexperienced, which could have affected his ability to properly assess the situation and make safe driving decisions. - V1 had inadequate surveillance, as he failed to see V2 approaching the intersection before making the right turn. - The right front tire of V1's vehicle had a bubble on the sidewall, which could have potentially affected the vehicle's handling and control. Overall, V1's illegal maneuver, aggressive driving behavior, lack of familiarity with the area, inexperience, inadequate surveillance, and potential tire issue all contribute to his primary responsibility for the accident.
