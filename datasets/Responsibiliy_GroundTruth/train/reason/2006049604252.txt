The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was engaging in aggressive driving behavior by speeding in a school zone and making a sudden lane change without ensuring a safe distance from the vehicle in front. The driver's actions of passing slower traffic on the right, exceeding the speed limit, and cutting in front of another vehicle demonstrate a lack of caution and disregard for the safety of others on the road. The blinding sun may have been a contributing factor, but it is not the primary cause of the accident.
