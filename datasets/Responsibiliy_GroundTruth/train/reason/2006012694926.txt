The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to Vehicle #2 (V2), which was making a left turn. V1's driver admitted to being distracted by looking at a boat in a sales lot and stated that he did not see the stop sign. This constitutes an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic laws. On the other hand, V2's driver came to a complete stop at the stop sign and assumed that V1 would also stop. However, V2's driver made a false assumption about the actions of other road users, which contributed to the accident. While V2's driver was driving on a suspended license and the license plate was not registered to V2, these factors do not directly contribute to the cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and the distraction caused by looking at a boat.
