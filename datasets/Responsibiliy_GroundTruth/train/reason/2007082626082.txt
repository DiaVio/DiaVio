The driver of V1 reported that he was cut off by a non-contact vehicle and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering towards the right. However, his foot slipped off the brake and hit the gas, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The driver failed to reapply the brakes in time to regain control, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway, impacting various objects, and ultimately rolling over. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that another vehicle was involved in the incident. However, the critical reason for the event is attributed to V1's driver-related factor of poor directional control. The driver's actions of steering right and pressing the gas without reapplying the brakes contributed to the loss of control and subsequent rollover. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rollover collision due to the driver's failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle.
