The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling at a high speed, attempting to pass uninvolved vehicles before the roadway narrowed. The critical reason for the crash was determined to be driver-related, specifically the driver's decision to drive too fast for the curve. This decision ultimately led to Vehicle #1 going off the roadway, impacting with various objects, and ultimately resulting in a fatal accident.
