The driver of V1 reported that he blacked out just prior to the crash, indicating a critical non-performance error due to a physical impairment. Additionally, the driver admitted to being fatigued, in a hurry, and preoccupied with personal problems, which were all coded as associated factors. These factors suggest that the driver of V1 was not in a proper physical or mental state to operate a vehicle safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for drifting into the third lane of travel and colliding with V2, which subsequently pushed V2 into V3.
