The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver drifted off the edge of the road onto the uneven shoulder. Although the driver attempted to correct the drift by sharply steering to the left, this action caused V1 to skid and ultimately collide with the concrete median barrier, resulting in the vehicle rolling over onto its side. The driver's overcompensation and performance error in response to drifting off the road led to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Factors such as conversation with the passenger, the construction work zone, the condition of the shoulder, and unfamiliarity with the vehicle and roadway were also associated with the driver of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and errors.
