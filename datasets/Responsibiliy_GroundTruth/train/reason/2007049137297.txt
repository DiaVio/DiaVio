The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and struck the front of V2. V1 stated that she did not see V2 because the non-contact vehicle blocked her view of westbound lane one. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the path is clear before entering an intersection, even if there are obstructions. V1's failure to properly assess the situation and proceed with caution resulted in the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) also mentioned that the non-contact vehicle blocked her view and she applied the brakes when she saw V1 just before the crash. However, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to ensure a clear path before entering the intersection, despite the obstruction caused by the non-contact vehicle.
