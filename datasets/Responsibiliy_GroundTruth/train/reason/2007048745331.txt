The reason for this is that V2 traveled off the left side of the road and through the median, entering the westbound lanes and ultimately striking the front of V1. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." Additionally, the driver of V2 had positive results for amphetamine, cannabinoids, and methamphetamine in their autopsy, indicating the presence of drugs in their system. These factors suggest that V2 was not driving within their lane and may have been impaired by drugs, both of which contributed to the collision with V1.
