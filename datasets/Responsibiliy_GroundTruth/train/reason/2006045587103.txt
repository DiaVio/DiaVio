The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the sharp curve to the right. The driver stated that the vehicle hydroplaned, indicating that she was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions. Additionally, the driver's speed was above the advised speed limit for the curve, as indicated by the presence of curve warning signs advising a lower speed. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to adjust speed for the curve and wet roadway conditions.
