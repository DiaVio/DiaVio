The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a high speed of approximately 112kph/70mph, which was above the posted speed limit of 89kph/55mph. - V1 swerved to the right to avoid a non-contact van (NC) that changed lanes into its path, indicating a lack of proper control and awareness. - V1 lost control and crossed multiple lanes, ultimately colliding with V2 (the 1997 Chevrolet Blazer) in lane one. - V1's driver was not wearing a seatbelt, which could have contributed to the severity of her injuries. - The driver of V1 admitted to being frustrated and in a hurry, which may have led to reckless driving behavior. - The driver of V1 also admitted to smoking marijuana the night before the crash, which could have impaired her ability to drive safely. - Additionally, V1 had tire deficiencies, with larger than OEM tires that were underinflated, which could have affected the vehicle's handling and control. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
