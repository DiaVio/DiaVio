The reason for this is that V2, traveling southbound, entered the intersection and impacted the left side of V1, which was traveling eastbound. V2's frontal plane collided with the left side plane of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. This suggests that V2 either ran a red light or failed to stop at the intersection when the traffic signal was indicating for V1 to proceed.
