The reason for this is that V2 was attempting a left turn into a driveway, and as it entered the driveway, it partially blocked the eastbound number one lane, which is the lane V1 (the Nissan Altima) was traveling in. V1 then collided with the right plane of the trailer being pulled by V2. Although V1's visibility may have been reduced due to the glare of the sun, the primary responsibility lies with V2 as they were the one making the left turn and blocking the lane of oncoming traffic. Additionally, V2's driver was distracted by looking for an address, which further contributes to their responsibility for the collision.
