The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is traveling too fast for road conditions. The driver stated that he had driven this roadway every day and didn't expect the roads to be in the condition they were. Despite the slush-covered roadway, the driver failed to adjust his speed accordingly, leading to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
