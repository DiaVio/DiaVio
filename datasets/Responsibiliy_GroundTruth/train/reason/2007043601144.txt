The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop when the traffic signal turned red for them. This is considered an illegal maneuver and a violation of traffic laws. As a result, V1 entered the intersection when it was not their right of way, causing the collision with V2. Additionally, there are concerns about the driver of V1's ability to drive safely. The driver's family had noticed signs of declining driving skills, such as overlooking street signs and slower reaction times. While this information does not directly contribute to the cause of the accident, it raises concerns about the driver's overall competence and judgment on the road. In contrast, the driver of V2 was following the traffic signal and had the right of way to make a left turn. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling turning left at intersection," indicating that V2 was following the appropriate maneuver at the time of the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to stop at the red light and their illegal maneuver make them primarily responsible for the accident.
