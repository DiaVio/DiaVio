The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that she falsely assumed that the driver of V1 (the 1994 Ford Ranger) would yield the right of way. This assumption led to V2 encroaching into the left lane of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, an associated factor for V2's responsibility was her emotional state, as she had just visited a sick relative at the hospital. However, this emotional state does not absolve her of responsibility for the crash. No other contributing factors were coded to either vehicle.
