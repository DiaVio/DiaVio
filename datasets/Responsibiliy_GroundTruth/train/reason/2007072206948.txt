The driver of V1 was arrested for drug impairment, indicating that they were likely under the influence of drugs at the time of the crash. This impairment could have affected their ability to operate the vehicle safely and maintain proper control. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; type of driver error unknown," suggesting that the driver of V1 made an error that led to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (2000 Ford Explorer) was healthy, well-rested, and familiar with her vehicle. She stated that she did not see V1 prior to the crash, indicating that she was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's drug impairment and the unknown driver error that led to the collision.
