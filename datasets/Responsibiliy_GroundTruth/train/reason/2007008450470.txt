The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver falsely assumed that V2 would stop at the intersection, even though V2 did not have a stop sign. This false assumption of other's actions led to V1 pulling out into the intersection and colliding with V2. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced and unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to the driver's lack of understanding of the right of way at the intersection.
