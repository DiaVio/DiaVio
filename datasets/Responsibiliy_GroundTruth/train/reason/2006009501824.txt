The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that she lost control of her vehicle while trying to avoid a collision with another vehicle that passed her on the right and then braked suddenly in front of her. This indicates that V1's driver made an evasive maneuver that resulted in her losing control of the vehicle and ultimately causing the collision with V2 (the 2000 Mercury Mountaineer) and V3 (the 1998 Ford Windstar). Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the critical reason was coded as driver-related overcompensation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's evasive maneuver and subsequent loss of control.
