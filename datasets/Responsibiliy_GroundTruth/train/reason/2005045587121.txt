The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 lost control near the apex of the curve to the left, crossed into the northbound lanes, and departed the east (left) edge of the road. The driver then over-corrected and began a clockwise rotation, crossing both travel lanes and departing the west (right) side of the road, ultimately colliding with a tree. The Critical Precrash Event was coded as off the edge of the road on the left side, and the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as too fast for the curve. Additionally, associated factors such as rain and a left front tire with minimal tread depth may have contributed to the loss of control. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their speed and driving behavior according to the road conditions and to maintain control of their vehicle.
