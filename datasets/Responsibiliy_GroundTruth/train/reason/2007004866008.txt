The reason for this is that V1 attempted to turn left into the driveway without properly judging the gap or the speed of V2 (the driver of the Honda Accord) approaching from the opposite direction. V1's misjudgment of the gap and V2's speed led to the collision. V1 made no avoidance maneuver, indicating a lack of awareness or failure to take appropriate action to prevent the accident.
