The driver of V1 admitted to feeling uncomfortable driving in the snow and icy conditions, which were present at the time of the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "This vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." This indicates that V1 was traveling at a speed that was not appropriate for the snowy and icy road conditions. Additionally, V1 skidded and crossed over the left lane line into the northbound lane, where it was struck by V2. The driver of V2 was traveling in the correct lane and did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the weather conditions and losing control of the vehicle.
