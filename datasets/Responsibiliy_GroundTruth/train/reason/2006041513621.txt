The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected of a good driver. The driver's statement that he thought he kept hitting the brake, but nothing was happening, indicates a performance error and poor directional control. Additionally, the driver repeatedly depressed the gas pedal instead of the brake pedal, which further contributed to the loss of control.
