The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that initiated the chain of events by striking a pedestrian and then proceeding to drive across multiple lanes of traffic, ultimately colliding with V2, V3, and V4. The driver of V1 was described as confused and mentally unstable, and her age-related factors likely contributed to her poor directional control and inability to stop the vehicle. She also attempted to leave the scene after the accident, further indicating her lack of awareness and responsibility.
