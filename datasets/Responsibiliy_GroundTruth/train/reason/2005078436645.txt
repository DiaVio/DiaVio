The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before crossing, which is indicated by the critical reason being coded as "inadequate surveillance." The driver looked to his right but did not see V1 approaching from that direction. Additionally, the driver's line of sight was restricted due to vehicles stopped in the northbound traffic lanes. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident.
