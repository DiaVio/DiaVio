The reason for this is that the driver of V1 had a history of seizures and was observed to be having a seizure at the time of the crash. This physical impairment of the ability to act directly caused V1 to leave the roadway, hit a tree, a stop sign, and ultimately crash into a telephone pole. Additionally, the driver did not have a legal driver's license and had previously been involved in another crash due to a seizure.
