The driver of V1 was distracted by a personal discussion with his daughter and failed to notice that the vehicles in front of him had stopped. This distraction caused him to steer right and apply the brakes at the last moment, resulting in the collision with V2 (the Dodge Caravan) and subsequently pushing V2 into V3 (the vehicle making a left turn). The driver of V1's internal distraction and failure to pay attention to the road ahead directly led to the accident.
