The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the critical pre-crash event coding, the critical reason for V2 was inadequate surveillance. This means that V2 failed to adequately look or failed to see V1 approaching before making the left turn. Additionally, it is mentioned that there may have been a partial sightline restriction by an intervening in-transport vehicle that V1 was in the process of passing. However, V2, as the driver making the left turn, has the responsibility to ensure that it is safe to proceed before making the turn, regardless of any potential sightline restrictions. Therefore, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and ensure it was clear before making the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
