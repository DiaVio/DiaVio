The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to adequately surveil the road ahead. The driver admitted to being distracted by digging in her purse to retrieve her cell phone, which caused her to not notice that Vehicle 2 had stopped abruptly due to the non-contact vehicle pulling out of a parking space. This distraction and failure to look ahead resulted in Vehicle 1 colliding with the rear end of Vehicle 2.
