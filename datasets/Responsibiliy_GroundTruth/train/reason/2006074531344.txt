The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was not paying attention and inadvertently traveled into lane two, where V1 was traveling. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 and entered the roadway without noticing the oncoming vehicle. This driver-related factor of inattention led to the critical pre-crash event of V2 traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. Therefore, V2's lack of attention and failure to properly navigate the intersection caused the collision with V1.
