The reason for V1's responsibility is that it drifted into the median and hit the concrete barrier, causing it to enter a counterclockwise rotation and roll backwards. This action resulted in V1 entering into the path of V2 (the 2005 Jeep Wrangler) and being struck by its front left corner. Since V1 initiated the sequence of events that led to the collision, it is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
