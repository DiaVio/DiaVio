The reason for this is that V2 struck the back of V1 while it was stopped to pick up passengers at the bus stop. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped." Additionally, the driver of V2 had drugs (Marijuana, Amphetamines, and Opiates) in his system one hour after the crash, which indicates impairment and potential negligence on his part.
