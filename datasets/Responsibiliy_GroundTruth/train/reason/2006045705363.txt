The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was cited by the police for driving on an expired license, indicating a violation of traffic laws. - V1 claimed that the utility pole on the southwest corner obstructed his view, but it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure a clear view before entering an intersection. - V1's recognition error and inadequate surveillance, along with inattention and internal distraction, contributed to the crash. - The sightline obstruction posed by the utility pole was an associated factor, but it does not absolve V1 of responsibility for not taking appropriate precautions. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield the right of way to V2, along with the violation of driving on an expired license, makes V1 primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
