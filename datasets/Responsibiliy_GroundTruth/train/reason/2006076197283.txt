The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver, a 70-year-old male, admitted to falling asleep while driving. This driver-related factor of being actually asleep is the critical reason for the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. The driver's statement of waking up when the vehicle was already off the road and releasing the gas pedal to let the vehicle roll to a stop further supports the fact that he was asleep at the time of the crash. Additionally, the driver's medical condition, undergoing chemotherapy and other cancer treatments, and taking several unknown medications daily, may have contributed to his drowsiness and increased the likelihood of him falling asleep while driving. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's sleeping while operating the vehicle.
