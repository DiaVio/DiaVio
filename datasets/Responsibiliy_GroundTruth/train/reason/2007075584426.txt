The reason for this is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph), exceeding the posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph) and the advisory limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) for the curve. - V1 had bald tires, which could have reduced traction and contributed to the loss of control. - The driver of V1 reported drinking three beers before the crash, and the presence of alcohol may have impaired his judgment and reaction time. - The driver of V1 was distracted by looking to his right to see if he had successfully passed a non-contact vehicle, taking his vision off the roadway and resulting in a left side road departure in the curve. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 was not exercising proper caution and control, leading to the accident.
