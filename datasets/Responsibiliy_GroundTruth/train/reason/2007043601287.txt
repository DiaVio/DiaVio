The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1, driven by an 80-year-old male, failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Despite stopping at the intersection and looking in all directions, V1 did not see V2 approaching from the west. - V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look resulted in V1 entering the intersection without sufficient clearance, leading to the collision with V2. - Additionally, V1 expressed discomfort with the general traffic flow in the neighborhood due to parked cars and houses close to the road, which may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation. It is important to note that V2's involvement in the accident is not without fault. V2 was driving under the influence of alcohol, cocaine, and cannabinoid, which is a contributing factor to the accident. However, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and proceed with insufficient clearance makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
