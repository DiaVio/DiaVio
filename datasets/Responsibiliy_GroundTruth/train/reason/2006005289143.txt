The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which caused the vehicle to depart from the roadway and strike a tree. This initial impact caused V1 to rotate and re-enter the roadway, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 1989 Chevrolet Celebrity). The driver of V1's inexperience and failure to adjust their speed to the wet road conditions contributed to the crash.
