The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was engaged in a non-driving activity, specifically looking down at her cell phone to check the time. This distraction caused her to fail to recognize that traffic ahead had slowed down, resulting in her being unable to slow down in time and subsequently veering off the road. Additionally, the driver failed to look far enough ahead and was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the conditions.
