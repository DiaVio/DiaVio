The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve/turn on the downhill grade. The police reported travel speed for V1 was 72 kmph, which exceeds the speed limit of 56 kmph. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions" and the critical reason was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for curve/turn." Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust the speed according to the road conditions and the curve/turn.
