The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve, which caused the vehicle to lose traction and skid off the left edge of the road. Additionally, the driver's panic and overcompensation further contributed to the loss of control. The driver's inexperience, as she had only been driving for two months, also played a role in the crash. Other contributing factors include the narrow road with no shoulders, wet surface, and the fact that the road was very dark and not lighted, making it difficult for the driver to navigate safely.
