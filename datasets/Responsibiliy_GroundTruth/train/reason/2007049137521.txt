The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted to merge left from the first lane into the second lane without adequately checking for other vehicles. The driver of V1 admitted that she did not look to her left prior to initiating the lane change and did not see V2 when she began to merge. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver of V1 to exercise proper surveillance and ensure that it was safe to change lanes. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1994 Dodge Ram) stated that he did not see V1 prior to the impact. While V2 was encroaching into the right lane, it is important to note that V1 initiated the lane change without properly checking for other vehicles. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to exercise proper surveillance and causing the collision.
