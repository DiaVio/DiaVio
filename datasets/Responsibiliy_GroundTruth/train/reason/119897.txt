The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of their vehicle on the icy road surface, resulting in a counterclockwise rotation and crossing the centerline into the path of Vehicle two (V2). V2 was unable to avoid the collision, indicating that V1's loss of control was the initiating factor in the accident.
