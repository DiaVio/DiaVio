The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it impacted the rear of Vehicle #2 (V2), the 2008 Ford F550 Dump truck, while V2 was slowing down and almost coming to a stop due to a line of traffic in front of it. V1 attempted to avoid the crash by braking and steering to the right but was unsuccessful. This indicates that V1 was following too closely to V2 and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in the rear-end collision.
