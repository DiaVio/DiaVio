The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver of V1 stated that he stopped to check for cross traffic but did not see V2 approaching. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming motorcycle. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," further supporting the conclusion that V1's failure to properly observe the intersection was the critical factor leading to the accident. Since no information is available for the driver of V2, it is not possible to determine if any contributing factors from their side played a role in the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision.
