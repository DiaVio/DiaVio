The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection, which means they had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. V1, the 1997 Dodge Stratus, was traveling straight through the intersection in the eastbound lane, and therefore had the right of way. The impact occurred when V2 entered the intersection and was struck by the front of V1. Additionally, the case occupant, who was the driver of V1, was not belted and sustained serious injuries. While this is a contributing factor to the severity of her injuries, it does not change the fact that V2 was primarily responsible for the accident.
