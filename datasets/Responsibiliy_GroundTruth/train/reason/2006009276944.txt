The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that they swerved to miss a deer in the middle of the roadway, which caused them to depart the roadway and drive into a ditch. The critical reason for the pre-crash event was inadequate evasive action, specifically steering only. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 did not take appropriate measures to avoid the collision, such as braking or slowing down before swerving.
