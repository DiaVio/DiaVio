The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection and attempted to turn left across the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee). This action violated the right of way of Vehicle 2, which was traveling straight in the southbound lane. The collision occurred when the right front side of Vehicle 1 was impacted by the frontal area of Vehicle 2.
