The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and made an error by steering left, jumping the median, and entering oncoming traffic. This action resulted in a head-on collision with V2 (the 2000 Toyota Corolla). Additionally, V1's driver was arrested on a charge of DUI, indicating that alcohol may have impaired their judgment and contributed to the crash.
