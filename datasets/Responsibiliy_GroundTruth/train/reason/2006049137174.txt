The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the path of V1. Since V1 was turning left at the intersection, it is expected that V2 should have yielded the right of way to V1. However, V2 failed to do so and collided with the right side of V1. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and encroaching into the path of V1 makes V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
