The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver knew the brakes were bad and still chose to drive the vehicle without getting them fixed. This resulted in brake failure, causing V1 to drive off the edge of the road and into the drainage ditch. Additionally, the driver was inattentive and failed to look far enough ahead, as he was tracking the police vehicle in the rearview mirror and talking to his passenger instead of focusing on the road. The combination of brake failure, inattentiveness, and failure to maintain the vehicle's tires contributed to the crash.
