The driver of V1 failed to stop at the intersection for the red light and did not yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1995 Saturn SL) who was initiating a left turn on a green left-turn arrow. This indicates a clear violation of traffic laws and failure to recognize the red light and the presence of V2 turning in front of her vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to her failure to obey traffic signals and yield the right of way.
