The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing the stop sign and took no avoidance actions to prevent the crash. This indicates a lack of attention and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance," further supporting the driver's responsibility. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two (V2) was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street across path," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to observe the stop sign and take necessary actions, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
