The driver of V1 failed to see the oncoming V2 (the Daewoo Leganza sedan) approaching from the right while entering the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by putting on his seat belt, which was identified as an internal distraction. The inadequate surveillance by the driver of V1 contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and the distraction caused by not being properly restrained.
