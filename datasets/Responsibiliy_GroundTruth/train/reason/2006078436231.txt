The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the 2001 Ford Mustang). V1 assumed that V2 would stop and allow them to safely turn left, even though V2 had the right of way. This false assumption led to V1 making a decision error, resulting in the collision.
