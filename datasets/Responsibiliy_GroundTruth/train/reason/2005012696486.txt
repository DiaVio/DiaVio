The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 reported a recognition error and internal distraction as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not fully attentive and made an error in recognizing the situation, leading to the loss of control and subsequent impact with V2 and the concrete barrier wall. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest that V2 contributed to the crash.
