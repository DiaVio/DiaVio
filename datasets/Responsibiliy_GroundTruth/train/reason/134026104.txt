The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right pavement edge and struck the barrier curb, causing minor damage. Subsequently, Vehicle 1 impacted the concrete parapet end of the bridge rail, resulting in moderate damage. This indicates that Vehicle 1 was not properly controlled and veered off the road, leading to the collision with the bridge.
