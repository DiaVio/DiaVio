The reason for this is that V1 was traveling eastbound and, while negotiating a curve, the vehicle edged off the right side of the road. The driver then overcorrected, crossing the two lanes and going into a counterclockwise rotation. This ultimately led to V1 departing the left (north) side of the road and striking a guardrail. The driver's unknown error of overcorrection and potentially traveling too fast contributed to the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver fled the scene on foot suggests a lack of responsibility and accountability.
