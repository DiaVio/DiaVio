The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to exercise proper caution while making a left turn. The driver admitted to being distracted by the vehicle in front of him and did not look for oncoming traffic until after entering the intersection. This lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2.
