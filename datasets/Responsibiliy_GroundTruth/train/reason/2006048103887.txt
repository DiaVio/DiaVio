The driver of V1 was attempting to merge from lane one into lane two, but misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the light gray/silver 2005 Chevrolet Colorado). V1 was over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 was not fully in control of the merging maneuver. Additionally, V1's driver stated that he was looking over his shoulder to his left (rear) at the time of the crash, which suggests a lack of attention to the merging process. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the gap or other's speed, as well as the decision error of proceeding without sufficient clearance, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
