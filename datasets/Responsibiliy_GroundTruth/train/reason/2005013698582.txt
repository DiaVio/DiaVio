The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver's performance error of panicking. The driver admitted to hitting the brakes very hard upon seeing the traffic light ahead, which caused the vehicle to go into a counter-clockwise rotation. Additionally, the driver's attempt to steer to the left worsened the situation, leading to the vehicle going off the roadway, striking a light pole, and ultimately coming to a rest after spinning 360 degrees and hitting a sign. Therefore, V1's driver's panicking and subsequent actions resulted in the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
