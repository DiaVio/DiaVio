The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop for a traffic control device, specifically a red light at the intersection. This is evident from her statement that she did not see the light turn red and proceeded through the intersection. Additionally, V1's inattention, inadequate surveillance, unfamiliarity with the roadway, and sightline restriction due to a building on the corner are all contributing factors that led to her failure to stop for the red light. V2 (the driver of the 1998 Pontiac Grand Prix sedan) had a green light and did not see V1 prior to the impact, indicating that V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. V3 (the driver of the 2004 Chevrolet Impala sedan) was stopped in lane three and was not involved in the first harmful event, indicating that V3 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to stop for a red light and other contributing factors.
