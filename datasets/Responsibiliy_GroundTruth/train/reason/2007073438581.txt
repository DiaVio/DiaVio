The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the passengers in the vehicle, specifically turning around to tell the children to quiet down. This distraction caused the driver to miss the stop sign and enter the intersection without yielding the right-of-way to V2. Additionally, V1's positive test for THC indicates the presence of a mind-altering substance in the driver's system, which may have impaired their judgment and reaction time. Therefore, V1's internal distraction, failure to obey a traffic control device, and the presence of THC in their system contribute to their primary responsibility for the accident.
