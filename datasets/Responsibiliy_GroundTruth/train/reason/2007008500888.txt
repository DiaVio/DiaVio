The reason for this is that the driver of V1, an 83-year-old male, was drowsy and fell asleep at the wheel while negotiating the curve. This driver-related factor directly led to V1 leaving the roadway, impacting signposts and a concrete base, and ultimately crashing into the tunnel. The driver's lack of sleep and drowsiness impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle, making him primarily responsible for the accident.
