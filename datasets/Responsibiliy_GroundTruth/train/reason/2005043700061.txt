The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was distracted by a broken-down vehicle receiving police assistance on the right roadside, which caused a recognition error and external distraction. - V1 failed to notice the stopped traffic ahead in lane three, including V2, and subsequently collided with the back of V2. - V1's distraction and failure to recognize the stopped traffic ahead led to the chain of events, including swerving across the median, striking a road sign, and ultimately crashing into a tree. - V1's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road and traffic conditions are significant contributing factors to the accident. It is important to note that V2 (the driver of the 1998 Acura SLX) was stopped in lane three at the traffic light and was not at fault for the accident. V2 was struck from behind without warning and had been stationary for half a minute before the collision occurred.
