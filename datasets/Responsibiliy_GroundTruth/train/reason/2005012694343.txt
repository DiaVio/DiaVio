The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 proceeded through the intersection against a red traffic signal. This is a clear violation of traffic laws and indicates that the driver of V1 failed to obey the traffic signal, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 admitted that he did not see the light until it was too late to avoid the collision, indicating inadequate surveillance. V2, on the other hand, was approaching the intersection intending to go straight and was following the traffic laws. Although V2 had some associated factors such as wearing glasses that darkened in the sunlight and being fully loaded with gravel, these factors do not contribute significantly to the cause of the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to stop for the red traffic signal and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the crash.
