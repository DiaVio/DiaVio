The driver of V2 admitted to a recognition error and inadequate surveillance, stating that they were looking at approaching traffic and down the side street on the left. This indicates that the driver of V2 failed to pay attention to the road ahead and did not see V1 stopped at the intersection until the last minute. Additionally, the driver of V2 falsely assumed that V1 would continue straight, which further contributed to the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their recognition error, inadequate surveillance, and false assumption.
