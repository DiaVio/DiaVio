The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn, which is coded as a driver-related factor: inadequate surveillance. This means that the driver of V1 either failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2) approaching in the opposite direction. As a result, V1 proceeded with the left turn, causing the collision with V2.
