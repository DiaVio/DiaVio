The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver's physical impairment of the ability to act. The driver blacked out prior to the crash, which was caused by a history of seizures and the medication he was taking for seizures and bipolar disorder. These medications have possible side effects of drowsiness, mental confusion, dizziness, and tiredness, which could have impaired the driver's ability to safely navigate the curve. Additionally, the driver was wearing corrective lenses for a nearsighted condition, which suggests that his vision may have been a contributing factor as well.
