The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, which impaired her ability to control the vehicle. She struck the curb, departed the roadway, and drove on the sidewalk before ultimately colliding with a tree. The investigating officer reported that the driver "reeked" of alcohol, and she refused a Breathalyzer test. Additionally, the driver's claim of swerving to avoid hitting an animal was not mentioned at the time of the crash and was only brought up in a later interview. Therefore, the driver's impaired state and poor directional control due to alcohol consumption make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
