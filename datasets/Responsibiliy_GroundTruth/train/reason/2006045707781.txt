The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was attempting to turn right from the right turn only lane on the arterial road onto the northbound lanes of the highway. However, while turning, the back wheels of Vehicle #1 lost traction, causing the vehicle to rotate clockwise and enter the left northbound lane instead of the intended right northbound lane. Vehicle #2, which was traveling in the left lane of the northbound highway, collided with the back of Vehicle #1. Vehicle #2 attempted to swerve right to avoid the collision, but was unable to do so in time. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, and the critical reason for this event was coded as too fast for conditions, heavy rain, accelerating, and turning right with a rear-wheel-drive vehicle. Inadequate surveillance was also attributed to Vehicle #1, as the driver stated that their view was obscured by rainfall and darkness. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #2 was other vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane in the same direction over the left lane line. However, the critical reason was not coded to Vehicle #2. In summary, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance, inexperience, and failure to maintain control of the vehicle while turning in adverse weather conditions.
