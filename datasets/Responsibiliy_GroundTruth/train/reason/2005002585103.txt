The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign and pulled into the path of Vehicle #1. This action caused Vehicle #1 to brake and steer to the left, resulting in the collision with the guardrail. Vehicle #2's driver stated that he had stopped at the stop sign but did not observe the approaching Vehicle #1 until alerted by a passenger in the van. Therefore, Vehicle #2's failure to yield and lack of awareness of the approaching vehicle led to the crash.
