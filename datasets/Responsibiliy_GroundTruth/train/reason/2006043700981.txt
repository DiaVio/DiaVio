The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph), which exceeded the posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) for the roadway. Additionally, the driver lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the downhill grade of 3% approaching the intersection. The driver's poor directional control resulted in V1 crossing over the intersection, departing the roadway, and ultimately colliding with a fence post and a tree. Furthermore, the driver's associated factors, such as a history of depression, kidney disease, and drug use, including the possibility of an overdose at the time of the crash, may have impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. However, without further investigation, it cannot be definitively determined if these factors directly contributed to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, poor directional control, and potential impairment from various associated factors.
