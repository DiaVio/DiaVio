The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at the posted speed of 113 km/h (70 mph) in wet conditions, which caused the vehicle to hydroplane and the driver to lose control. V1 then ran off the road, struck a guardrail end, and continued to rotate and move in a southerly direction. The driver and passenger of V1 sustained injuries as a result of the accident.
