The driver of V1 made a false assumption of other's actions when she was waved on by a stopped motorist. She believed that everyone was stopped and the coast was clear, but this was not the case. Additionally, there was a view obstruction due to other vehicles on the road, which impaired her ability to see approaching traffic in lane one. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and did not attempt any avoidance actions. While there were associated factors such as work-related stress, rush hour traffic, and sun glare, these factors do not absolve V1 of responsibility for making a decision error and turning in front of V2.
