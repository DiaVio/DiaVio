The driver of V1 was distracted by looking for an address and was not paying attention to the forward traffic. This distraction caused her to fail to notice that V2 was stopped in front of her, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's external distraction and failure to maintain proper attention on the road.
