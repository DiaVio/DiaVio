The reason for this is that V1 was traveling northbound and had a red light, indicating that they should have stopped at the intersection. However, V1 disobeyed the traffic control device and ran the red light, causing the collision with V2 and V3. Additionally, the associated factor of V1 traveling too fast for conditions suggests that V1 was not able to safely navigate the intersection, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident.
