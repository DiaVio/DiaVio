The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by the actions of the puppy riding in the back seat of the car. This distraction caused the driver to fail to negotiate the curve properly, resulting in V1 departing the roadway and colliding with various objects before coming to a rest. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver was conversing with both passengers and interacting with the puppy at the time of the crash, further indicating driver distraction as a contributing factor.
