The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before entering. The driver of V1 stated that he "looked both ways and did not see anything," indicating a lack of proper observation. This failure to properly assess the situation and ensure that it was safe to proceed resulted in V1 entering the intersection and being struck by V2. While V2 (the driver of the Dodge Ram pickup) assumed that V1 would wait until he passed the intersection, it was ultimately V1's responsibility to ensure that it was safe to proceed. V2's actions, such as applying the brakes and sliding on the wet roadway, can be seen as a reaction to V1's failure to yield the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
