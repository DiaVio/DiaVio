The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. It is unknown if V1 stopped at the stop sign before entering the intersection, but regardless, V1 failed to yield to V2 (the driver of the 1999 Chevrolet Lumina) who was traveling straight in the southbound lane. V2 was not at fault as she was driving within her lane and had the right of way. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "Other Motor Encroachment: from crossing street, turning into opposite direction," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to yield while turning left at the intersection.
