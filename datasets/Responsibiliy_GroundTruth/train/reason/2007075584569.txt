The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 80 kmph (50 mph), which was above the posted speed limit of 64 kmph (40 mph). Additionally, V1 was negotiating a left curve and ran off the right side of the road, indicating that the driver was going too fast for the curve. The driver's inexperience, as she is a seventeen-year-old, and the worn tread on the tires are also contributing factors to the crash.
