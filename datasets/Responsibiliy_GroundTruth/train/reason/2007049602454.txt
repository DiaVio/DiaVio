The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a left turn across the southbound lanes of traffic while V2 (the driver of the 1997 Honda Civic) was approaching the intersection. V1 misjudged the gap in traffic and failed to see V2 until she was already crossing lane three. Additionally, the investigating officer's report states that motorists in lanes one and two waved V1 through the intersection, which may have contributed to her decision to proceed. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of the gap and failure to yield to oncoming traffic are the primary factors that led to the accident.
