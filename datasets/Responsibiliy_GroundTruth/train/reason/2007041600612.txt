The driver of V1 admitted to following too closely and not being able to respond to the sudden braking of the vehicle in front of her. This indicates a driver error on her part, as she failed to maintain a safe distance and react appropriately to the situation. Additionally, the fact that V1's airbag did not deploy due to a previous crash suggests that the vehicle may not have been properly maintained or repaired, which could have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time.
