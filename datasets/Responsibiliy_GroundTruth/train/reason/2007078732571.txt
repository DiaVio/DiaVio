The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of the vehicle after the left rear tire tread separated. This indicates a failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver stated that she was traveling at a speed of 126 kmph (78 mph), which exceeds the speed limit of 121 kmph (75 mph) for the trafficway. This excessive speed may have contributed to the loss of control when the tire tread separated.
