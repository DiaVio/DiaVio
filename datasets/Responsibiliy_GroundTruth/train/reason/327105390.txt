The reason for this is that the driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle, crossed the centerline, and departed the roadway off the south shoulder. V2 then re-entered the roadway, traversed the railroad crossing, and entered the westbound lane, ultimately striking the left fender of the case vehicle (V1). This sequence of events indicates that V2 was the vehicle that initiated the collision and caused the case vehicle to depart the roadway.
