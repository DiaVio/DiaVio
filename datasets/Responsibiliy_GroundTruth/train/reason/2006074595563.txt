The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking towards the right at a friend on the sidewalk, which caused her to not notice that traffic had come to a stop ahead of her. As a result, she was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2 (the Nissan Pathfinder). Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of her led to the accident.
