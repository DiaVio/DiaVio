The driver was traveling at a reported speed of 100 kmph (62 mph) on a wet and slick roadway. The driver lost control of the vehicle, which started to rotate clockwise, and ultimately collided with multiple trees before coming to a rest on the shoulder of the road. Factors contributing to the driver's responsibility include: 1. Excessive speed: The driver was traveling at a speed close to the posted limit of 105 kmph (65 mph) on a wet road, which reduced traction and increased the risk of losing control. 2. Distraction: The driver admitted to talking with the passengers while driving, which could have diverted their attention from the road and contributed to the loss of control. 3. Inexperience with the vehicle: The driver mentioned that this was the first time driving this particular vehicle, which may have affected their ability to handle it properly in the given conditions. 4. Overloaded vehicle: The rear of the vehicle was loaded with a significant amount of luggage, which could have affected the vehicle's stability and the driver's ability to recover from a hydroplane. While the slick road conditions (from rain and snow) were an environmental factor that contributed to the critical event, the primary responsibility lies with the driver due to their speed, distraction, inexperience with the vehicle, and the possibility of an overloaded vehicle.
