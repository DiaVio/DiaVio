The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they proceeded to turn left at the intersection without having a clear line of sight of the southbound traffic due to the bus blocking their view. This is evident from the driver of V1 stating that they stopped at the stop sign for at least a minute, but proceeded because they thought the roadway was clear. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "turning left at an intersection" and the critical reason for this event was coded as "turned with obstructed view". On the other hand, no critical reason was coded for V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer), indicating that they did not contribute to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to ensure a clear line of sight before making the left turn at the intersection.
