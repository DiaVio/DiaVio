The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control while negotiating the left turning curve, leading to a rollover event. The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted counter-steering maneuvers but was unsuccessful. As a result, Vehicle 1 flipped over and struck the median guardrail with its right side plane before coming to rest in the median. No other vehicles were mentioned in the case summary, indicating that Vehicle 1 was the only vehicle involved in the accident. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
