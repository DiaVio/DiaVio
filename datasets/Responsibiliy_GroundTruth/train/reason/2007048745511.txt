The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to properly observe the intersection before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's inexperience and distraction by another driver honking their horn behind her were associated factors in this crash.
