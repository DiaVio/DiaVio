The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she crossed the centerline and attempted to turn left onto the rural road without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event identified for V1, which states that the vehicle was turning left at the intersection and the critical reason was the driver's inadequate surveillance. Additionally, contributing factors on the part of V1 include being agitated and upset due to a recent argument with the dealership, being unfamiliar with the route home, and her lane departure before attempting the turn. These factors indicate a lack of attention and awareness on the part of V1, further supporting her primary responsibility for the accident.
