The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a medical emergency, which led to a physical impairment of their ability to act. This critical non-performance error caused the driver to inadvertently engage the transmission and depress the accelerator, resulting in the unguided movement of the vehicle. The driver's lack of recollection of the crash events and the presence of a brain tumor removed in the past suggest a potential underlying medical condition that contributed to the blackout. Although drug use was suspected, no tests were conducted to confirm this. Therefore, V1's responsibility lies in the driver's physical impairment and inability to control the vehicle due to the medical emergency.
