The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by falsely assuming that cross-traffic would yield the right-of-way because his emergency lights were activated. This false assumption led to inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to look both ways before entering the intersection against a red light. Additionally, the driver's view was obstructed by eastbound vehicles stopped in the left turn lane, which masked the impending problem of V2 approaching from the east. The driver's hurry to respond to an emergency call and the traffic flow interruption caused by the emergency response were also contributing factors. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error, inadequate surveillance, and obstructed view.
