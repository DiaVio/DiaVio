The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a blackout or seizure while driving, which impaired his ability to control the vehicle. This is supported by the driver's statement that he cannot recall the sequence of events leading to the crash and his medical records indicating a seizure unrelated to his pacemaker or heart arrhythmia. The critical pre-crash event of V1 drifting off the left side of the road and the critical reason of a physical impairment further support the driver's inability to act appropriately while driving.
