The reason for this is that V2 crossed over the center lane and continued traveling in the opposite lanes, ultimately causing the front of V2 to impact the left side of Vehicle three (V3) in the northbound lane. V2 then continued forward and collided with the front left half of case Vehicle one (V1). This sequence of events indicates that V2 was traveling in the wrong direction and failed to maintain control of their vehicle, resulting in the collision with V3 and V1.
