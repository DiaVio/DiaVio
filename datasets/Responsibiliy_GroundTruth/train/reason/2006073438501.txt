The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was turning right onto the alleyway and began to back into the street without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver of Vehicle two (the 1998 Ford Escort) honked her horn to alert Vehicle one, but Vehicle one continued to back up, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle one was coded as an environmental-related factor, specifically, the view obstructed by other legally parked vehicles. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle one did not take adequate precautions to ensure a clear view before backing up. Therefore, based on the actions of the drivers and the coding of the critical pre-crash events, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident.
