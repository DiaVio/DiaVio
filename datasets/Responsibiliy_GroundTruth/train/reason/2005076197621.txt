The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes into the second lane, a two-way left turn lane, without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. V1 then slowed down and turned left into a parking lot, failing to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2004 Dodge Stratus) who was traveling in the first lane of the westbound direction. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as inattention (i.e., daydreaming), indicating that the driver of V1 was not fully focused on the road and may have been distracted by personal matters, such as the recent breakup and argument with her boyfriend. Therefore, V1's failure to properly change lanes and yield the right of way, combined with the driver's inattention, makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
