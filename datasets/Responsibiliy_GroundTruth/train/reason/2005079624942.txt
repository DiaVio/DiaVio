The reason for this is that V1 was traveling eastbound on the roadway and skidded across the intersection, ultimately leaving the road and colliding with a signal light pole. The fact that the driver and passenger of V1 fled the scene suggests that they may have been aware of their responsibility for the accident. Additionally, the inspection of V1 revealed severely under-inflated tires, which could have contributed to the loss of control and skidding. This indicates a lack of proper vehicle maintenance and potentially negligent behavior on the part of the driver. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's error and the vehicle's maintenance issues.
