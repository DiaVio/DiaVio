The reason for Vehicle 1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of Vehicle 1 had a recognition error and was internally distracted. The driver admitted to looking down at the speedometer and failed to look far enough ahead, resulting in a failure to notice that traffic was slowing down. Additionally, Vehicle 1 was following too closely to Vehicle 2 initially, which contributed to the collision. The driver's rush hour congestion and being in a hurry to get to work also played a role in the crash. On the other hand, Vehicle 2 (1998 Mercedes ML320 SUV) was not primarily responsible for the crash. Although Vehicle 2 was traveling at a higher speed, this was not identified as the critical reason for the crash. The driver of Vehicle 2 was familiar with the vehicle and comfortable driving it, and there were no other factors directly attributed to Vehicle 2's involvement in the crash. In summary, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's recognition error, internal distraction, inadequate surveillance, following too closely, and being in a hurry. Vehicle 2's involvement in the crash was primarily due to the rush hour congestion, but it was not the critical reason for the crash.
