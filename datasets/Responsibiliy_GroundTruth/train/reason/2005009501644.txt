The reason for this is that V1's driver, a 75-year-old female, stated that she did not see V2 (the 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue) until contact was made. This indicates that V1's driver failed to adequately surveil the road and failed to notice V2 stopped and waiting to turn. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance can be considered the critical reason for the accident.
