The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn on the exit ramp. This is evident from the fact that V1 veered to the left and struck the left side barrier, then veered to the right and struck the right side barrier. The driver's poor directional control and emotional distress, as a result of arguing with his mother and being stressed about potential consequences, were associated factors in the crash.
