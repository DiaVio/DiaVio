The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is the misjudgment of the gap or the other vehicle's speed while attempting to make a left turn from a private drive onto the highway. The driver of Vehicle #1 pulled into the path of Vehicle #2 (the 1994 Nissan Sentra), resulting in the collision. Although there were witness statements indicating that Vehicle #2 appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for failing to yield the right of way and misjudging the gap or the speed of oncoming traffic.
