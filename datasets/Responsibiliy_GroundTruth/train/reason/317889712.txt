The reason for this is that V1 drifted left and crossed the center turn lane into the opposing travel lane, ultimately causing the front of V1 to collide with the front of V2 (the 2005 Ford F-250). V1's action of drifting into the opposing travel lane indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and stay within their designated lane, resulting in the collision.
