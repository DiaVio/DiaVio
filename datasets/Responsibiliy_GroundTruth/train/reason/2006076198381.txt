The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and made a recognition error. The driver dropped a lit cigarette and attempted to retrieve it while driving, causing her to lose control of the vehicle. This distraction led to V1 crossing both northbound lanes and departing the left road edge, ultimately resulting in the crash.
