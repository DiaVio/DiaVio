The reason for this is that the driver lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons. It is mentioned that the driver was not familiar with the vehicle and had only driven it a few times in the past few months. Additionally, there were potential mechanical issues with the vehicle, such as a welded front wheel bearing and a vibration at higher speeds. These factors suggest that either a mechanical malfunction or the driver's perception of a mechanical failure contributed to the loss of control. Furthermore, it is noted that the driver's seat was in a position that limited her ability to respond to emergency situations. This could have further hindered her ability to regain control of the vehicle. Overall, the combination of driver unfamiliarity, potential mechanical issues, and limited ability to respond to emergencies suggests that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
