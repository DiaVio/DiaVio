The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The driver of V2 was focused on the car in front of her and did not see V1 approaching from the opposite direction. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to not feeling rushed but was scheduled to be at work within a few minutes of the crash, indicating a possible distraction or lack of attention. These factors contribute to V2's responsibility for the accident.
