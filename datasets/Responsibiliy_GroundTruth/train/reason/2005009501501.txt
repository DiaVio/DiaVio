The reason for this is that V1's front plane struck the rear plane of V2 (the Ford F600 truck), indicating that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. Additionally, V1's Critical Pre-crash Event was coded as "other vehicle stopped in lane," suggesting that V1 failed to react appropriately to the stopped traffic ahead, resulting in the collision. While V2's Critical Pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle traveling in the same direction with higher speed," indicating that the non-contact vehicle may have been a contributing factor, V2 came to a slow controlled stop for the road crew and stated that he almost did not even know that contact was made to his vehicle. This suggests that V2 was driving responsibly and was not the primary cause of the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to following too closely and failing to react appropriately to the stopped traffic ahead.
