The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to being distracted by an external factor while changing lanes. He stated that he turned his head over his right shoulder and checked his side view mirror, but failed to look far enough ahead. If he had looked further ahead, he may have seen the traffic stopping for the construction zone ahead. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 did not exercise proper surveillance and failed to anticipate the traffic conditions. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (the 2002 Honda Accord) was stopped for traffic in the rear, indicating that the driver of Vehicle #2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and external distraction.
