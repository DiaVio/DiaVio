The reason for this is that the driver of V2 admitted to being inattentive and misjudging the gap or speed of V1. She failed to properly survey the traffic before merging from the number two lane to the number one lane, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 was late for a social appointment and may have been rushing, which could have contributed to her inattentiveness and misjudgment. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her driver-related factors and failure to yield the right of way to V1.
