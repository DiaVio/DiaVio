The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including V2 (the 1993 Cadillac Deville), before initiating the left turn. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's emotional state, related to problems with members of her congregation, was an associated factor in the crash. While emotional distress may have contributed to her lack of attention, it does not absolve her of the responsibility to ensure a safe turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
