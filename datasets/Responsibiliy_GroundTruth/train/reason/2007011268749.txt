The reason for this is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was distracted by glancing down, resulting in a recognition error. V1 admitted to being 3-4 car lengths behind V2 (the Ford F350) and did not notice that V2 had slowed down to turn right into a driveway. Despite applying full ABS braking, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the back of V2. While V2 was also involved in the accident, the driver of V2 had slowed down and properly signaled his intention to turn into the driveway. V2 was not at fault for the collision as V1 failed to react in a timely manner. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and being distracted, resulting in a failure to recognize the slowing of V2.
