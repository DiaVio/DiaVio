The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that it departed the road off the right side, entered a ditch, and began to yaw counterclockwise. It then struck an embankment and sideswiped a tree with its right side, resulting in a one-quarter turn rollover. This sequence of events suggests that V1 lost control and veered off the road, ultimately leading to the accident.
