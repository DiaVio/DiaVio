The reason for this is that the driver of V1 reported falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle departing its lane, crossing over the paved shoulder, and drifting off the north edge of the freeway. The driver's drowsiness and subsequent loss of control resulted in the rollover event and the collision with the large metal sign/post adjacent to the north shoulder.
