The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead, overcompensated when he realized there was another vehicle in lane two, and ultimately lost control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's discomfort with the vehicle, his focus on an extraneous vehicle, and his illness and use of flu medications were associated factors that contributed to the crash.
