The reason for this is that the driver of V-1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead when attempting to change lanes. This lack of proper surveillance led to the driver colliding with the rear of V-2 (the 2003 Ford F-150 pickup), which was stopped at the intersection. The impact then pushed V-2 into the back of V-3 (the 1995 International Truck Tractor pulling a trailer). Therefore, V-1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to avoid colliding with the stopped vehicle ahead.
