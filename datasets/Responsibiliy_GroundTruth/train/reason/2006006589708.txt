The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one attempted to make a left turn westbound from the northbound lane, crossing over into the southbound lane and colliding with the front of Vehicle two (1996 International Bus). The driver of Vehicle one admitted to encroaching into the southbound lane already occupied by Vehicle two. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one was found unconscious at the scene and had a high suspicion of drug usage, with several bags of controlled substances found in her vehicle. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to Vehicle one was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," and the Critical Reason was "other critical non-performance - unconscious due to heroin usage." On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two was traveling southbound on his regular bus route and had no contributing factors or critical reasons coded to him. He observed Vehicle one approaching from the opposite direction and believed she was attempting to make a left turn but over-shot it. He expected her to realize her mistake and stop, but she continued and collided with his vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with Vehicle one due to the driver's impaired state and failure to properly execute the left turn.
