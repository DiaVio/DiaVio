The reason for V1's responsibility is that the left rear tire tread separated, causing V1 to drift left, depart the roadway, and ultimately crash into the guardrail and embankment. The tire failure was identified as the critical reason for the crash, indicating that a vehicle-related factor (tires/wheel failure) was the primary cause of the accident.
