The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to use due care and was cited a ticket for causing the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was another vehicle stopped in the lane, and the critical reason was driver-related inattention. Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front resulted in the rear-end collision.
