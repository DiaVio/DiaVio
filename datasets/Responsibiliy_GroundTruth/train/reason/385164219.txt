The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the roadway on the right side while approaching a curved and graded section of the road. It then traversed a gravel covered farm access road and climbed the embankment with its right side tires before ultimately colliding with a large tree. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, leading to the collision.
