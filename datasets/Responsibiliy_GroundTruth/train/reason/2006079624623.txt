The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1, who is not licensed but has completed basic driver education and has been driving for two years, misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 (the 1997 GMC C-1500 extended cab pickup) when attempting to make a left turn. V1's driver reported that she saw V2 but thought it was going slowly and believed she had sufficient time to turn. However, she did not take any avoidance action and proceeded with the turn, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed.
