The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for vehicle one was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." This indicates that vehicle one attempted to change lanes and crossed over the lane line, entering the blind spot of vehicle two (the 1999 Volvo Conventional 6x4 truck). As a result, the left side of vehicle one impacted the right side of vehicle two, causing the crash. While the driver of vehicle two stated that he never saw vehicle one and that it was in his right side blind spot, the critical pre-crash event for vehicle two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from adjacent lane [same direction] - over right lane line." This suggests that vehicle two was not at fault for the crash, as it was vehicle one that encroached into the adjacent lane. Therefore, based on the information provided, vehicle one is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's error of crossing over the lane line and entering the blind spot of vehicle two.
