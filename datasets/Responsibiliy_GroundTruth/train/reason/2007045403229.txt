The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being drowsy and stated that she hit the gas by mistake instead of the brakes, causing her to veer to the left and ultimately roll over. Additionally, the driver had a history of drug use and was taking multiple prescribed medications, which may have contributed to her drowsiness and impaired driving ability. The low tire pressure in one of the tires of V1 is also a contributing factor.
