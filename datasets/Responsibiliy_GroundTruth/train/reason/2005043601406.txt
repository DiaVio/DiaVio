The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the left side of the roadway and ended up in a creek. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene before emergency services arrived, indicating a potential attempt to avoid responsibility. Furthermore, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 89 kmph, which exceeds the speed limit of 72 kmph. This suggests that V1 was traveling at an unsafe speed for the road conditions, which were described as dark and wet. Lastly, the fact that V1 was found to be in the possession of a tow yard for stolen vehicles, with the owner's address listed as incorrect and the lender stating that payments have not been made, raises suspicions about the legality and ownership of the vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to its departure from the roadway, excessive speed, and the driver's attempt to flee the scene.
