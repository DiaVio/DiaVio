The reason for V-1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn. Despite looking to her right and left, the driver did not see V-2 approaching in the right turn lane due to the vehicles stopped in the eastbound lanes obstructing her line of sight. This inadequate surveillance led to V-1 turning across the path of V-2, resulting in the collision.
