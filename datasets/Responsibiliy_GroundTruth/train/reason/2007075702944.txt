The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and failed to stop for traffic. The driver admitted to glancing down at the time and not paying attention to the road ahead. This distraction caused her to be unaware of the braking of V2 (the Dodge Caravan) in front of her. Additionally, V1 was in a hurry and following too closely, which contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and being distracted by looking at the time are the main factors that make her primarily responsible for the accident.
