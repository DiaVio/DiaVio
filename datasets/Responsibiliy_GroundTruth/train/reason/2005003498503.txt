The driver of V2 admitted to stopping at the stop sign before proceeding through the intersection. However, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically a decision error of crossing with an obstructed view. The driver of V2 mentioned a sightline restriction caused by legally parked vehicles, indicating that she may not have had a clear view of oncoming traffic before entering the intersection. This decision error ultimately led to the collision with V1 (the Mercedes-Benz ML320).
