The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by changing songs on the CD player just prior to the crash. This distraction likely caused V1 to fail to stop and collide with the back of V2 (the Toyota Camry). V1's internal distraction is a driver-related factor that directly contributed to the crash.
