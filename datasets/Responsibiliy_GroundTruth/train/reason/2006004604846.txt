The reason for this is that V2 was illegally passing a stopped vehicle on the right-hand shoulder, which is an illegal maneuver. As V2 passed the stopped vehicle, it struck V1 on the right side, causing the collision. V2 attempted to avoid V1 by applying the brakes and turning to the right, but was unsuccessful. The collision between V2 and V1 then caused V2 to be pushed into V3, which was stopped at the westbound stop sign. Therefore, V2's illegal maneuver and failure to avoid the collision make them primarily responsible for the accident.
