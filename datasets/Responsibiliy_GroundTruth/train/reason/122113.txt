The reason for this is that the driver of V2 recognized that Vehicle three (V3) was stopped in the road and attempted to avoid a collision by swerving to the left. However, in doing so, V2 ended up striking the back of V3. This initial collision then caused a chain reaction, with V3 moving forward and striking the rear of Vehicle four (V4). V2 continued to jack-knife and entered the eastbound lane, where it ultimately collided with Vehicle one (V1) as it was entering the intersection area. Therefore, V2's actions of swerving and subsequently colliding with multiple vehicles indicate that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
