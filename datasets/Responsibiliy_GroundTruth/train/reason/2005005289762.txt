The driver of V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 64kph (40mph) and failed to yield the right of way to V1 (the driver of the 2004 black Chevrolet Malibu) who was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection. V2 struck the right front of V1, causing V1 to spin and ultimately collide with V3 (the 2005 red Honda Civic). Although V1 claimed that V2 accelerated after the light turned yellow, the responsibility lies with V2 for failing to observe and react to the turning vehicle in front of them. The fact that V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and did not slow down or attempt to avoid the collision indicates a lack of attention or misjudgment on the part of the driver. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their involvement in the collision with V1.
