The reason for this is that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making a left turn. He was distracted by looking down at paperwork on the seat and did not realize that V1 was passing his vehicle on the left side. This failure to properly observe the roadway and check for approaching traffic from behind led to the collision between V1 and V2.
