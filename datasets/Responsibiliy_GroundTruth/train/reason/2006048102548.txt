The reason for V1's responsibility is the driver-related factor of internal distraction. The driver of V1 was reportedly injecting a substance believed to be methamphetamines at the time of the crash, as stated by an EMS technician on the scene. This indicates that the driver was impaired and distracted, which likely contributed to V1 traveling off the right side of the roadway and colliding with the gas main pipe and building.
