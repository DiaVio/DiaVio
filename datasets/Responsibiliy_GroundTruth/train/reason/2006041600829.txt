The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were traveling at nearly 97 kmph (60 mph) on the wet curved exit ramp, which had an advisory speed of 40 kmph (25 mph). This indicates that V1 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions and the curve of the exit ramp. Additionally, V1's vehicle control loss due to hydroplaning further supports their responsibility for the crash. Furthermore, the fact that V1 had new tires on the front but old and worn tires on the rear suggests a tire deficiency, which could have contributed to the loss of control on the wet road surface. In summary, V1's failure to slow down and adjust their speed to the wet road conditions, combined with the tire deficiency, led to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
