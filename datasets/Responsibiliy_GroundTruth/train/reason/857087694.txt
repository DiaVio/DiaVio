The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 reportedly became incapacitated, possibly due to a seizure, and lost control of the vehicle. As a result, Vehicle 1 crossed the center line into the southbound through travel lane and struck Vehicle 2 head-on. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle, leading to the collision.
