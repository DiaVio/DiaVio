The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in a northwesterly direction on a two-lane rural roadway and departed the right pavement edge, resulting in an offset frontal impact with a large diameter tree. This initial impact caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise and initiate a rollover sequence, ultimately resulting in multiple impacts with trees and the vehicle coming to rest on its roof. The driver of Vehicle 1 was found restrained and hanging upside down, indicating that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle and prevent the rollover.
