The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was traveling at a higher rate of speed than V2 (the driver of the 1995 Dodge Neon) and failed to reduce her speed, resulting in the rear-end collision. Additionally, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to maintain a safe following distance contributed to the accident. The driver's inattention due to personal concerns and the recent loss of her sister also played a role in the recognition error that led to the collision.
