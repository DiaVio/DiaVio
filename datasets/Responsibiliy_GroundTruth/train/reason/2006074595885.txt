The driver of Vehicle one entered the intersection to turn right, but failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. This lack of surveillance resulted in the collision with Vehicle two (the 1999 Ford Taurus) and subsequently Vehicle three (the 1998 Mercury Villager mini van).
