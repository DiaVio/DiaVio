The reason for this inference is that the case occupant, who was in Vehicle 1 (V1), was forced sideways and came into contact with the intruding left door panel and the front of Vehicle 2 as it intruded into the left side of V1. This suggests that Vehicle 2 was the one that caused the impact and intrusion into V1, resulting in the injuries and ultimately the death of the case occupant. Please note that this inference is based solely on the information provided and a more comprehensive investigation may be required to determine the actual responsibility for the collision.
