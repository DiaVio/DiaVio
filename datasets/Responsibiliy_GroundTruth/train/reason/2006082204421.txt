The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was distracted by an external factor, specifically the passenger who had called her for help. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle one had a blood alcohol level of 0.17, which is above the legal limit. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle one was not fully attentive and impaired at the time of the collision. Furthermore, the driver of Vehicle one admitted to not seeing Vehicle two until the collision occurred, suggesting a lack of awareness and negligence on her part. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two (2005 BMW X3 SUV) stated that she did not see Vehicle one, indicating that she may not have been at fault for the collision. However, without any additional information or evidence to suggest otherwise, the responsibility falls primarily on the driver of Vehicle one.
