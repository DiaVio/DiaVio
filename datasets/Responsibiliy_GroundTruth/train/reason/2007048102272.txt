The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep prior to the crash, as stated in her medical records. Falling asleep while driving is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver tested positive for Methadone and unspecified opiates, which may have impaired her ability to operate the vehicle safely. The fact that V1 traveled off the right side of the road and struck a tree further supports the conclusion that the driver was not in control of the vehicle at the time of the crash.
