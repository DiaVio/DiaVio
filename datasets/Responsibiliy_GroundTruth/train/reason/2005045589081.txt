The driver of Vehicle #1 changed lanes without properly checking for other vehicles ahead, resulting in a failure to recognize that Vehicle #2 (1994 Buick Regal) was stopped at the intersection due to a red light. This recognition error, combined with external distractions and insufficient braking inputs, led to the rear-end collision with Vehicle #2. Although Vehicle #2 was stopped at the intersection, the critical reason for the critical event was not coded to this vehicle. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1.
