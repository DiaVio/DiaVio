The driver of V1 was distracted and inattentive while reaching to the floor for a fallen soda cup, which caused V1 to depart from the right road edge. Additionally, the driver's overcompensation while trying to return to the roadway led to V1 departing the travel lane again and ultimately flipping and rolling multiple times. Therefore, V1's driver's actions and overcompensation were the critical reasons for the accident.
