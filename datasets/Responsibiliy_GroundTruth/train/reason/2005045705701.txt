The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is as follows: - Vehicle #1 was traveling in the left lane on the ramp and over-steered when a non-contact vehicle changed lanes in front of it. - Vehicle #1 then overcorrected by steering left to compensate for the previous error. - As a result of the overcorrection, Vehicle #1 skidded off the left side of the road and struck the end of a guardrail with the right side of the vehicle. - Vehicle #1 continued down the embankment, hitting a small tree and running over it. - It then veered right, coming back down the embankment and striking a second small tree before coming to rest on top of the stump. - The driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to aggressive driving behavior, including engaging in an altercation with another driver prior to losing control. - The driver's fatigue, lack of sleep, and the potential side effects of the allergy medication he was taking may have also contributed to the driver's decision error and loss of control. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the circumstances leading up to the crash, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
