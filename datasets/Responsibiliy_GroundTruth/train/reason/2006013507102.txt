The driver of V1 admitted that she did not notice that the traffic control device had changed for her direction and entered the intersection without stopping. This indicates a failure to obey traffic signals and exercise due care while driving. Additionally, the driver's statement that she thought she still had the green light shows a lack of attention and awareness of her surroundings. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
