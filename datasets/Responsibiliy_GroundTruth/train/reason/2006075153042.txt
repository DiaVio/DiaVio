The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that he did not stop before initiating the left turn and was looking left as he entered the turn. This indicates that he failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic from the westbound lanes, including V2. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "inadequate surveillance." This suggests that V1 did not adequately monitor the movement of other vehicles before making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and detect the presence of V2 resulted in the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
