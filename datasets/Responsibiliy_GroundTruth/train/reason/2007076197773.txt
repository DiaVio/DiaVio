The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 97 kmph (60 mph), which was well above the speed limit of 56 kmph (35 mph) for the area. Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol and drugs, as witnessed by the researcher on scene. These factors contributed to the driver's inability to negotiate the left curve, resulting in V1 crossing the double yellow center line and ultimately crashing into a bush and a large rock. The underinflated tires may have also played a role in the loss of control of the vehicle.
