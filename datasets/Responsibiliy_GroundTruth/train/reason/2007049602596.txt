The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically heavy rain and limited visibility. The driver of V1 stated that she began to slow down due to the heavy rain, but never saw V2 prior to the impact. This indicates that V1 failed to adjust her speed appropriately for the weather conditions, resulting in the collision with the back of V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver in front of V1) was decelerating along with the rest of the traffic in anticipation of the standing water on the roadway. This suggests that V2 was taking appropriate precautions given the weather conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to adjust her speed for the heavy rain and limited visibility makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
