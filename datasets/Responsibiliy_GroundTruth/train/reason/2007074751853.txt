The reason for this is that V2 was making an illegal left turn from the middle travel lane, across the path of V1. V2's driver admitted to inadequate surveillance and inattention, stating that he never saw V1 prior to initiating the turn. Additionally, V1 was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any contributing factors mentioned in the summary.
