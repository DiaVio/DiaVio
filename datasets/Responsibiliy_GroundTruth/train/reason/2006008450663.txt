The driver of V1 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection and continued through, resulting in a collision with the guardrail. The driver's inadequate surveillance, failure to look far enough ahead, and traveling at excessive speed for the conditions all contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver was engaged in a social conversation with the other occupants of the vehicle, indicating inattention. The driver's lack of experience driving on this road also played a factor.
