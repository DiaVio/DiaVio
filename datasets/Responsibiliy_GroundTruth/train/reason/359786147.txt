The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced an unknown medical episode, which caused him to accelerate at a high rate of speed. As a result, V1 collided with the back of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2000 Dodge Ram B1500 van. This initial impact caused V2 to be overpowered and pushed forward. Subsequently, V2 collided with Vehicle 3 (V3), the 2006 Saturn Ion, causing minor damage to V2's front bumper. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to the medical episode that led to the acceleration and subsequent collision.
