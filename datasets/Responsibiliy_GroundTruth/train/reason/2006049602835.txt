The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical reason for the pre-crash event of V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including V2, before initiating the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper surveillance and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V2, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
