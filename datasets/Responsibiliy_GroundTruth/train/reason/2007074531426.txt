The reason for this is that V2 was stopped at the intersection in the same lane as V1, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This indicates that V2 was aware of V1's presence but failed to take appropriate action to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 admitted to being on her cell phone at the time of the crash and did not see V1 prior to the collision. This further supports the conclusion that V2 was not paying sufficient attention to the road and was therefore responsible for the accident.
