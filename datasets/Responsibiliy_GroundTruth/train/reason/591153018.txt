The reason for this is that V1 struck the left front of V2, resulting in a one o'clock principal direction of force impact to V1. This indicates that V1 was at fault for not yielding the right of way to V2, which was traveling straight through the intersection. Additionally, V1's frontal-impact and both right side-impact airbags deployed, suggesting that V1 was the striking vehicle in this collision.
