The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 crossed the double solid yellow center stripe, indicating that they were driving in the wrong lane. This action led to V1 departing the road over the right road edge and subsequently colliding with various objects, including a tree, a chain-link fence, and a cinder-block wall. The driver's overcompensation while trying to correct their position on the road contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain proper lane position and overcompensation while attempting to correct their mistake.
