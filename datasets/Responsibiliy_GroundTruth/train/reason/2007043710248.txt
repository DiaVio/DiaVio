The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they turned left with an obstructed view. V1 was stopped in the left turn lane and couldn't see the northbound traffic due to cars stopped in front of them waiting to turn left at the traffic signal. Despite being unfamiliar with the area and the heavy rush hour congestion, V1 decided to turn left without being able to see oncoming traffic. This driver error led to the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Jeep Wrangler) had the right of way as they were proceeding straight through the intersection on a green light. V2 applied the brakes and steered right to avoid the collision, but the crash was unavoidable due to V1's actions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident because they turned left with an obstructed view, while V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way.
