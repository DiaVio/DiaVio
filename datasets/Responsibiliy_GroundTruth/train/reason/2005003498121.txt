The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 took the curve too fast and skidded off the ramp into a guardrail. The driver's claim that an unknown vehicle caused him to lose control and drive into the guardrail was not deemed credible, as there was no evidence of tire tracks on the grass to the right. Additionally, the driver received a citation for operating a commercial vehicle on a parkway, indicating a violation of traffic regulations. The driver's distraction by a non-contact vehicle may have contributed to his failure to reduce speed sufficiently to safely negotiate the curved ramp.
