The reason for this is that V2 was stopped in lane two, waiting to turn left, and then accelerated into the intersection without warning. V1, which was traveling in lane one, had just started from a nearby intersection and was passing through the intersection when V2 struck it from the right. V2's illegal maneuver of running the stop at a high speed and colliding with V1 indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way and violated traffic laws. Additionally, V2 left the scene of the crash before the police arrived, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility.
