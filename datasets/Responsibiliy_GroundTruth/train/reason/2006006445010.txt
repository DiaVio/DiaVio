The reason for this is that V2 was making a left-hand turn at the intersection, and it is the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to yield to oncoming traffic. V2 failed to yield to V1, which was traveling straight through the intersection in the eastbound lane. This failure to yield resulted in V1 striking V2. Additionally, the critical event coded to V2 was "This Vehicle Traveling/Turning left at intersection," further indicating that V2's left turn was a contributing factor to the accident. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield while making a left turn at the intersection.
