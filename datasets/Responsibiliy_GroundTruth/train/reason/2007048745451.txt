The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she turned left at the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. The driver of V1 stated that southbound traffic in lanes three and four were stopped to allow her to make the turn. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; turned with obstructed view." This indicates that V1 turned with an obstructed view, which means she did not have a clear line of sight to see oncoming traffic, including V2 (the driver of the 1992 Chevrolet Camaro). Therefore, V1's failure to ensure a clear and safe path before making the left turn resulted in the collision with V2, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
