The driver of V1 failed to recognize that V2 (the 1996 Chevrolet Cavalier) was stopped in the lane, waiting to merge into traffic. Despite having a clear view of the stopped vehicle after the curve in the roadway, the driver of V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with V2. The driver of V1 should have been able to see the stopped vehicle and react accordingly, especially considering the road conditions (straight and level) and the fact that the area was illuminated by intermittent streetlamps. The driver's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle indicates a recognition error, which is the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned attending a concert and making a stop before entering the roadway. While this information does not directly contribute to the cause of the crash, it suggests that the driver may have been fatigued or distracted, which could have impaired their ability to recognize and react to the stopped vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle and take appropriate action to avoid a collision.
