The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to overreacting and steering suddenly to the right, which caused her vehicle to begin a counterclockwise rotation. This sudden maneuver resulted in the right side of V1 impacting the left side of V2 (Event 1). Additionally, V1 continued traveling off the left side of the roadway and impacted the median wall with its front (Event 2). The driver of V1 also stated that she was knowingly speeding at the time of the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 attempted to steer right and brake to avoid the impact but was unable to do so. Therefore, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's sudden maneuver, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
