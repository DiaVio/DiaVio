The driver of V1 made a false assumption of the other driver's actions and turned left at the intersection, thinking they had the right of way. However, the intersection did not have protected left turn arrows, and the driver of V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic. This false assumption and failure to yield resulted in the collision with V2 (the Lincoln Continental). While V2 was cited for encroaching over the left lane line, the critical reason for the pre-crash event was not attributed to V2. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for their false assumption and failure to yield.
