The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver stated that something in her steering broke, causing her to lose control of the vehicle. The critical pre-crash event coded for V1 is "vehicle control loss due to disabling vehicle failure, broken tie rod," and the critical reason for the critical event coded for V1 is "vehicle related, steering failed." Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash because the driver's inability to steer and regain control of the vehicle led to the collision with the mailbox and power pole.
