The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a driver-related decision error by turning left at the intersection without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. Her view was obstructed by the backed-up traffic that waved her through to make the turn. As a result, she failed to see V2 (the 2005 Dodge Caravan) approaching in lane 1, leading to the collision.
