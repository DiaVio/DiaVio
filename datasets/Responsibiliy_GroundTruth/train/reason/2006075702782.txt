The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. The location of the final rest position of V1 indicates that the driver did not come to a complete stop. Additionally, the driver admitted to being unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to the failure to stop. The presence of shrubbery restricting the sightline also played a role in the driver's inability to see V2 approaching. V2, on the other hand, applied the brakes and attempted to avoid the collision when she saw V1 entering the intersection. Although V2 mentioned checking her messages on her cell phone prior to the collision, this does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for failing to stop at the stop sign. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign, their unfamiliarity with the roadway, and the presence of shrubbery obstructing their sightline.
