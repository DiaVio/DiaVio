The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol with a high BAC level, indicating impaired judgment and coordination. Additionally, the driver had not slept adequately, which likely contributed to fatigue and reduced alertness. These factors compromised the driver's ability to maintain control of the vehicle and react appropriately when the vehicle entered the right shoulder. The driver's poor directional control and overcorrection ultimately led to the vehicle sliding into the snow-covered median and rolling over.
