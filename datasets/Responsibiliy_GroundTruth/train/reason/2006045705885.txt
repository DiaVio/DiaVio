The reason for this is that V1 rear-ended V2 (the Pontiac Sunbird) while V2 was slowing down to make a left turn onto the access road. V1's driver was attributed with insufficient steering and braking inputs, indicating a recognition error on their part. Additionally, the traffic flow interruption factor of V2 slowing down for the left turn was also included. Therefore, V1's failure to recognize and react to the slowing vehicle in front of them, resulting in the rear-end collision, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
