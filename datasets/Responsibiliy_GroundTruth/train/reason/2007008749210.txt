The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 admitted to being somewhat confused and not realizing that V2 was stopped until it was too late to stop the impact. This indicates a failure on the part of V1 to properly observe and react to the situation on the road. Additionally, the associated factors of wet roads, heavy rain, and fog may have contributed to the difficulty in seeing and reacting to the stopped vehicle. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and maintain proper surveillance in adverse weather conditions. The tire conditions of V1, with the front tire being overinflated and the back tires being underinflated, could have also affected the vehicle's handling and braking capabilities, potentially contributing to the inability to stop in time. Overall, V1's failure to adequately surveil the road ahead and react in a timely manner, combined with the adverse weather conditions and tire conditions, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
