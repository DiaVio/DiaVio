The reason for Vehicle #1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which resulted in the loss of control while negotiating the curve. Additionally, the driver's distraction and false assumption about the vehicle pulling out from the side road contributed to the poor directional control. The driver's hurry to get to school and unfamiliarity with the rental vehicle further compromised her ability to safely navigate the curve.
