The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over the left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line and encroached into the path of V1, causing the collision. V1, on the other hand, was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a legal maneuver. Therefore, V2's encroachment into the opposite lane was the main factor that led to the collision.
