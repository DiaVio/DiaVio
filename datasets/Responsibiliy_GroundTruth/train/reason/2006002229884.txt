The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to consuming alcohol prior to the crash, which impaired her ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was distracted and arguing with her passenger, further diverting her attention from the road. The driver's actions of jerking the steering wheel in response to her passenger grabbing it ultimately caused the vehicle to veer off the roadway and crash. Furthermore, neither occupant was wearing a seat belt, which contributed to the severity of their injuries.
