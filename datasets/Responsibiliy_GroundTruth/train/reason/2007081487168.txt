The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking at a previous crash on the opposite side of the road. This distraction caused V1 to take their eyes off the road and fail to notice that V2 (the 1998 Ford Escort sedan) had stopped for traffic ahead. As a result, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2. V1's external distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road are key factors that led to the accident.
