The driver of V1 admitted to not taking his medication for seizures, which may have caused him to feel "funny" and experience a seizure while driving. This impaired his ability to react in a timely manner when he noticed the light turning yellow and the vehicles in front of him stopping. The witness also observed the driver of V1 with his head reclined back, indicating a possible loss of consciousness or impairment. Additionally, the witness heard the tires skid on the wet pavement, suggesting that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed given the road conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to control his vehicle and his impaired state contributed to the collision.
