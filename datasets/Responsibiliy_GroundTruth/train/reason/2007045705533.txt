The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by turning left from a driveway into the opposite direction without adequate surveillance and with an obstructed view. V1 falsely assumed that the road was clear because a non-contact vehicle's driver had stopped in lane 1 of the arterial and waved her out. Additionally, V1's driver was fatigued due to lack of sleep issues associated with her medical condition, and she was emotionally upset and distressed before the crash occurred. These factors contributed to her failure to properly assess the traffic situation and make a safe turn. V2 (the 2007 Ford Expedition) was driving in lane 2 southbound at a low rate of speed, hoping for the light to turn green up the road. V2's driver had limited opportunity to react and was unable to avoid the collision. However, V2's actions do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident.
