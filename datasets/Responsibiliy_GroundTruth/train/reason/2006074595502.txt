The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle two was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that the driver of Vehicle two did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including Vehicle one, before initiating the left turn. Although Vehicle one was traveling in the right lane and had the right of way with a green signal, the driver of Vehicle two's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Vehicle one attempted to avoid the collision by applying the brakes, but was unable to do so in time. Therefore, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to exercise proper surveillance and yield the right of way.
