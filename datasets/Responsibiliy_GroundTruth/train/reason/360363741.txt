The reason for this is that V1 initiated the lane change without ensuring it was safe to do so, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2010 Honda Insight. This initial impact caused minor damage to both vehicles. Following the initial impact, V2 moved to the left and came to a rest, while V1 continued south and collided with the east jersey barrier. This subsequent impact resulted in serious injuries to the driver of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to safely execute the lane change, leading to the subsequent collisions and injuries.
