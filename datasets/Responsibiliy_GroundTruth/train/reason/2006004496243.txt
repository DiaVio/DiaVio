The driver of V1 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, but stated that the traffic was heavy and his view was obstructed by other vehicles. Despite this, he proceeded to make the turn and struck the front of V2 (the Dodge Durango SUV) which was traveling straight in the westbound lane. The driver of V2 did not take any avoidance actions and was traveling within the speed limit at the time of impact. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. V1, on the other hand, made a left turn without ensuring that it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with V2. The driver's obstructed view and discomfort with the surrounding traffic densities are contributing factors, but ultimately, it was the driver's responsibility to ensure a safe turn. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn.
