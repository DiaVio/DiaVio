The driver of V1 admitted to being tired and inattentive, which contributed to the collision. Additionally, V1 failed to stop in time when V2 (the driver of the Volvo station wagon) braked for a cat crossing the roadway. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from V2 led to the collision.
