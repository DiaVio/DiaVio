The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 attempted to proceed southbound across the intersection, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2001 Dodge 3500 Series Quad Cab 4x4 turbo diesel heavy duty pickup truck). As a result, Vehicle 1 was impacted on its left side by the frontal area of Vehicle 2, causing moderate damage. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, leading to the collision.
