The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver experienced physical impairments while negotiating the left curve, leading to difficulty breathing and lightheadedness. As a result, the driver lost consciousness and the vehicle veered off the right roadside into the ice plant. The vehicle continued to track straight, bouncing across the relatively level terrain until it struck its front undercarriage in a shallow depression. This sequence of events suggests that the driver's physical impairments and subsequent loss of consciousness were the primary cause of the accident.
