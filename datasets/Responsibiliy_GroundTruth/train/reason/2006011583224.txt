The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she drove off the roadway onto the right shoulder, re-entered the roadway, crossed both lanes, and ultimately struck multiple trees before coming to a rest off-road. This indicates a performance error, specifically overcompensation, as the critical reason for the crash. Additionally, factors such as the driver's unfamiliarity with both the roadway and the vehicle, her emotional state (being irritated and upset due to bad news), and lack of restful sleep may have contributed to the cause of the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1's performance error in overcompensating while negotiating the curve.
