The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 swerved to the right in an attempt to exit the highway, but was traveling too fast for the curve/turn of the exit ramp. This driver-related factor indicates that V1 was not able to safely navigate the exit ramp, resulting in the collision with the traffic barriers on both the right and left sides of the ramp. Additionally, witnesses stated that the driver of V1 made a delayed decision and turned onto the exit ramp when it was unsafe to do so.
