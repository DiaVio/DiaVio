The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that he looked left and right but did not see V2 (the Chevrolet truck) approaching. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to rarely driving on this road and having inexperience with the intersection, which could have contributed to the lack of awareness. While V2 did have a critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment from crossing street across path," it is important to note that V2 was already in the intersection and had the right of way. V2 attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the collision, indicating a reasonable response to the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's recognition error and inadequate surveillance.
