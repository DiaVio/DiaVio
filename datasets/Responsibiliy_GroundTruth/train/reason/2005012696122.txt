The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 swerved to avoid a non-contact vehicle, overcompensated, and lost control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 skidding off the roadway, colliding with a guardrail, and ultimately entering the westbound roadway in an upside-down position. The subsequent collision with V2 (the 2002 Pontiac Aztec) was a direct result of V1's loss of control. While V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Aztec) was also involved in the crash, their actions of braking and swerving to avoid V1 indicate that they took appropriate avoidance actions. Additionally, V2's excess speed, traveling at 80 mph in a 70 mph zone, was a contributing factor but not the primary cause of the crash. V3 (the driver of the 1998 Dodge Ram van) was not involved in the first harmful event and took appropriate avoidance actions, so they are not primarily responsible for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their overcompensation and loss of control, resulting in the subsequent collisions with V2 and V3.
