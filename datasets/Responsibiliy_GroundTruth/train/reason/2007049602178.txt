The reason for this is that V1 drove off the road to the left, re-entered the roadway, and then departed the right side of the ramp while in a clockwise rotation. This indicates poor directional control, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the police on the scene indicated that the driver was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crash, further supporting the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible.
