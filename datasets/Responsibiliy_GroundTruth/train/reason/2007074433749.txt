The reason for this is that V1's back left tire/wheel fell off, which caused it to roll across the intersection and strike V2 and V3. This indicates a vehicle-related factor, specifically a failure of the tires/wheels on V1. As a result, V1's inability to maintain control of their vehicle and prevent the tire/wheel from causing the collision makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
