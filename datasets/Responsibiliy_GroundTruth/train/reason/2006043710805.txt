The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 72 kmph (45 mph) and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2). When V1 realized that V2 had stopped suddenly, they applied the brakes and steered left in an attempt to avoid the collision. However, V1 was unable to stop in time and the front right of their vehicle collided with the rear left of V2. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was coded as inattention. The driver of V1 alluded to personal problems and distractions during the interview, which may have contributed to their inattentiveness on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their excessive speed, failure to maintain a safe distance, and inattention while driving.
