The reason for this is that V1 was negotiating a left curve on a rural roadway but traveled partially off the roadway to the right. It then re-entered the roadway, crossed both travel lanes, and departed the left side, ultimately impacting a tree. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper control while negotiating the curve, resulting in the accident.
