The reason for this is that V2 was traveling well over the legal speed limit just prior to the collision. Additionally, V2 encroached over the left lane line, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. These factors suggest that V2 was not exercising proper caution and control while driving, which ultimately led to the collision with V1.
