The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to having severe vision impairment in his left eye, which gives him tunnel-like vision. This impairment likely contributed to his failure to notice the disabled vehicle (V2) in his lane until he was right on top of it. Additionally, the driver admitted to not paying attention and being preoccupied with his eyesight problem at the time of the crash. While V2 was disabled in the roadway, it is important to note that the driver of V2 remained in the vehicle and attempted to restart it. The hit-and-run driver could not be reached for an interview, so it is unclear if there were any additional factors that contributed to the control loss of V2. Overall, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's vision impairment, inattention, and failure to notice the disabled vehicle in the roadway.
