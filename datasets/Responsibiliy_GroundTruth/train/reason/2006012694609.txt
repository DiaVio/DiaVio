The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by glancing at his radio and then looking to his left. This distraction caused him to fail to notice that V2 was stopped ahead of him. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced and was traveling at an excessive speed, which further contributed to the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was not found to have contributed to the crash. She was not in a hurry, was wearing her prescription lenses, and had checked her rearview mirror before the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction, inexperience, and excessive speed.
