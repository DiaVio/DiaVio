The reason for this is that V1 drove through a large puddle on the roadway, causing the vehicle to rotate counter-clockwise and lose control. The driver of V1 stated that she was not sure which way she spun but believes it was counterclockwise. Additionally, the investigation of the vehicle revealed that the tires had very low tread depth. These factors indicate that V1's loss of control was primarily due to the driver's inability to handle the poor road conditions caused by the standing water, as well as the low tread depth of the tires. It is important to note that the subsequent accidents involving other vehicles losing control and hitting the guardrail or other cars are not directly related to V1's crash. Each accident should be evaluated separately to determine responsibility.
