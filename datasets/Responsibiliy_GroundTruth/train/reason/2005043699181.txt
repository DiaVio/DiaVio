The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reaching for a beverage just prior to the crash. When he looked up, he did not have enough time to stop and collided with the rear of Vehicle two (V2), which then caused a chain reaction involving Vehicle three (V3) and Vehicle four (V4). V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead contributed to the crash.
