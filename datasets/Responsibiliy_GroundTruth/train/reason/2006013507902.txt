The driver of V1 admitted to not adequately surveilling the road before making the left turn. He was fixated on the vehicle approaching from behind and failed to look for approaching traffic, including V2. This recognition error and failure to look for oncoming traffic led to V1 entering the path of V2, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
