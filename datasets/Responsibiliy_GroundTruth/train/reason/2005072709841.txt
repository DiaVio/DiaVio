The reason for this is that V1 departed from the third lane into the fourth lane and impacted the right side of V2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Blazer). Additionally, V1 then proceeded to collide with the concrete barrier on the left side of the roadway. Although the driver of V1 fled the scene and has not been identified, there were indications of alcohol involvement, such as a strong odor of liquor and empty liquor bottles in the vehicle. This suggests that the driver of V1 may have been under the influence of alcohol, which could have impaired their ability to safely operate the vehicle. Therefore, based on the actions of V1 and the potential influence of alcohol, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
