The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reading the messages on the restaurant's sign, which caused her to not see V2 (the 1999 John Deere tractor) until it was too late. This distraction is considered a driver-related factor and is the critical reason for the pre-crash event for V1. Additionally, V1 was traveling at the same speed as V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe following distance make her primarily responsible for the accident.
