The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was not wearing the available manual lap/shoulder belt and was also not belted at the time of the accident. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and drifted to the left, ultimately colliding with the impact attenuator at the end of the divided barrier. These factors indicate negligence on the part of the driver, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
