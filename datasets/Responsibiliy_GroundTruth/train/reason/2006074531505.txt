The reason for V1's responsibility is that they traveled onto the shoulder and struck the back of V2 (the parked and unoccupied 1990 Ford Tempo). This indicates that V1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and veered off the travel lane, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted at the time of the crash, as they were glancing at the vehicles to their left. This external distraction likely contributed to their failure to stay within their lane and avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1's actions and distractions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
