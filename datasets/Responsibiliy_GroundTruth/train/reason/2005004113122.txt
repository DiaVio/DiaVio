The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. Additionally, V1 was distracted by an ambulance and did not see the stop sign, further contributing to the driver recognition error. V1's failure to take any avoidance actions and the fact that it was the first time on the roadway also indicate a lack of experience and awareness.
