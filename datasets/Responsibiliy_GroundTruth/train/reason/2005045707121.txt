The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 departed the right side of the road and began a yaw left, indicating that the driver lost control of the vehicle. - The driver admitted to adjusting the radio controls just before the vehicle left the roadway, indicating an internal distraction. - Fatigue was also a factor, as the driver is a full-time student and works 50 hours per week at a physical job, which could have intensified the fatigue. - The driver was taking medications that could have caused drowsiness and fatigue as possible side effects. - The driver also stated that he was driving nearly miles per hour over the speed limit, indicating that he was driving too fast for the conditions. - Inexperience was coded to the driver based on his age, suggesting that his lack of driving experience may have contributed to the crash. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction, fatigue, excessive speed, and inexperience.
