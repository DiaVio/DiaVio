The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not look far enough ahead before making the left turn. Additionally, the driver stated that he entered the intersection on a solid yellow light, which indicates that he did not have the right of way. The driver's statement that he had a green arrow was not accepted as the most representative of the actual events. V2 (the 2000 Acura RL) is not primarily responsible for the crash. Although the driver of V2 was fatigued due to working long hours for several consecutive days, the critical reason for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment from opposite direction over left lane line." This suggests that V1's failure to yield and properly surveil the intersection was the main contributing factor to the crash.
