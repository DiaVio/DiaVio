The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling southbound on a curved roadway and failed to negotiate the curve properly. It continued in a forward tracking mode towards the right pavement edge, descending the super-elevation of the west shoulder and striking a drainage ditch. Despite this impact, the vehicle's trajectory was not altered, and it continued towards a roadside fence, sustaining contact along its right and left side surfaces. The vehicle then impacted a large diameter tree, resulting in severe damage. The lack of restraint use by the driver of Vehicle 1 is also a contributing factor to the severity of the injuries sustained. The absence of loading marks on the available seat belt system and the non-deployment of the front retractor pretensioners indicate that the driver was unrestrained at the time of the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's failure to negotiate the curve, the subsequent impacts with the drainage ditch, fence, and tree, and the lack of restraint use, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
