The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention and daydreaming, which resulted in him entering lane two occupied by V2 (the 1997 Lincoln Town Car sedan). This indicates a lack of caution and failure to realize that caution was required. The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was also coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, further supporting the driver's inattention. On the other hand, V2's Critical Precrash Event was coded as other motor vehicle encroachment from the adjacent lane, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the initial impact. Therefore, based on the driver's admission of not paying attention and the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
