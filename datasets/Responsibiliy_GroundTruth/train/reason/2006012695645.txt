The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to driving onto a patch of snow/ice on the northbound side of the roadway. This caused the vehicle to rotate clockwise and slide off the roadway. Despite the driver's attempts to regain control, the vehicle then rotated counterclockwise and crossed the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2001 Chevrolet Silverado pickup). V1's primary responsibility is further supported by the fact that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions, specifically slick roads caused by ice. Additionally, associated factors coded to V1 include traveling too fast for conditions and the weather (snow). While V2 was traveling too fast for conditions and the weather (snow), the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control on the icy road conditions, resulting in the collision with V2.
