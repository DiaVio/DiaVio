The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one admitted to being distracted by passing food to the passenger, which caused the vehicle to veer to the right and collide with the left side of Vehicle two's trailer. This internal distraction led to the critical pre-crash event of Vehicle one traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane. While Vehicle two (the 1998 Ford CBE tractor-trailer) was traveling at a slow speed and attempting to enter the ramp, the encroachment over the left lane line by Vehicle one was a result of the distraction and veering of Vehicle one. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle one.
