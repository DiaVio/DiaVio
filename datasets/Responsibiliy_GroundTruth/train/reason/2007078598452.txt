The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 97 kmph (60 mph) or greater, which was above the posted speed limit of 80 kmph (50 mph). Additionally, V1 was attempting to pass another vehicle while racing, which is an aggressive driving behavior. These actions led to V1 losing control of the vehicle, crossing into the northbound lane, and ultimately departing the roadway, resulting in the crash.
