The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by hanging up his cell phone, which was identified as a driver-related factor and the critical reason for the crash. This distraction likely caused him to lose focus on the road, resulting in V1 traveling off the right side of the roadway and colliding with a utility pole. Additionally, the driver mentioned that sun glare affected his view of the non-contact vehicle (NCV) driving down the middle of the road. However, it is important to note that the responsibility for maintaining control of the vehicle and avoiding collisions ultimately lies with the driver. In this case, the driver's distraction and subsequent overcompensation by abruptly steering to the right contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
