The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2 (the 2002 GMC Yukon), and V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn. The driver of V1 reported that she stopped at the stop sign and looked both ways, but the researcher believes she was not being truthful based on photos of the scene showing a clear unobstructed view. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look to the side contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and had the right of way. The driver of V2 reported seeing V1 turning left about five seconds before the impact and attempted to brake with lockup, but was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to properly surveil the intersection and yield the right of way to V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
