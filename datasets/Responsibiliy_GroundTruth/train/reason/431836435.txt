The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the south shoulder and traverse the grassy area between the eastbound roadway and on-ramp. This action, combined with possible driver steering inputs, caused the vehicle to tip and roll over. The rollover event resulted in severe top damage to Vehicle 1, including impacts with the concrete barrier wall, a large sign support post, and a small diameter U-channel sign support post. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their actions that led to the rollover and subsequent impacts.
