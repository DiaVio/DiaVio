The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt, indicating a failure to take necessary safety precautions. Additionally, the driver's attempt to avoid the impact by steering left was unsuccessful, suggesting a lack of proper control and awareness of the road conditions. The fact that the vehicle ultimately collided with a concrete median barrier and rolled over further indicates a lack of control and negligence on the part of the driver.
