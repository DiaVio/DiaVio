The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was weaving in and out of lanes, specifically between the third lane and the designated left turn lane. This behavior indicates a lack of proper control and poor directional control, which ultimately led to the loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event was coded as traveling too fast for conditions, further suggesting that V1 was not driving in a safe and responsible manner.
