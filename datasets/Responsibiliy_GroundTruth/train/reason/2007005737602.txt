The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, an 82-year-old female, experienced a blackout while driving, which caused her to drift off the road and collide with a telephone pole. Witnesses also reported that she was driving erratically prior to the crash. Additionally, the driver had a medical condition (mild dementia) and was using prescription medication for hypertension and anxiety, which could have impaired her ability to act appropriately while driving. The investigating officer recommended a special medical driver examination, indicating that the driver's physical impairment likely contributed to the crash.
