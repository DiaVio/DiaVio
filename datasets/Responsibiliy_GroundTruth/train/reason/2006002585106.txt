The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass the two non-contact vehicles in front of it, crossing into the southbound lane in a no passing zone. As V1 tried to re-enter the northbound lane behind V2, it sideswiped V2's left side, causing V1 to lose control and ultimately leading to the rollover accident. The witness statement also supports the fact that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than the other vehicles, further indicating that V1 was driving aggressively and not adhering to the speed limit or the rules of the road.
