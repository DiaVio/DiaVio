The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to partially depart the right pavement edge and then re-directed it back across the travel lanes towards the left pavement edge. This resulted in the vehicle striking a wire fence and subsequently impacting a tree. The driver's steering input and failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the accident.
