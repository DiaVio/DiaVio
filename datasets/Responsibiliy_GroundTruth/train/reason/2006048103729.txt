The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling - turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor - inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn into the private drive. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 (the driver of the 2007 Chevrolet K-1500 pickup) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment - from adjacent lane (same direction) - over the right lane line." The critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 did not contribute significantly to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and adequately surveil the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
