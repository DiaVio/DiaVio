The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to change lanes and struck the pile of sand between lanes, causing it to lose control and rotate counterclockwise into the southbound lane where it collided with vehicle two (V2), the 1986 Chevrolet Geo Prizm. V1's actions of changing lanes without proper control and colliding with the sand pile ultimately led to the accident.
