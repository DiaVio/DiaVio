The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle made the decision to pass the slower-moving non-contact vehicle on the right, which resulted in the loss of control of the case vehicle on the shoulder. This action ultimately led to the case vehicle entering a clockwise rotation, going into a ditch, and colliding with the concrete sewer access and stone culvert. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of the case vehicle was not wearing a three-point belt, which could have contributed to the severity of her injuries. The right-front passenger of the case vehicle was also not wearing a three-point belt and sustained severe injuries. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of the case vehicle due to their decision to pass on the right and subsequent loss of control, as well as the failure to wear a seatbelt.
