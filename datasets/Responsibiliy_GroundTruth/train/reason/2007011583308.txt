The driver of V1 was distracted by reaching over to pet/quiet his hunting dog while negotiating a curve. This distraction caused him to drift off the road and ultimately lose control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver only had one hand on the wheel, which further compromised his ability to steer and maintain control. The weather conditions, road condition, and worn shocks on the vehicle may have contributed to the accident, but the primary responsibility lies with the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle.
