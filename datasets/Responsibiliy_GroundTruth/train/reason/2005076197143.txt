The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn from the center left-turn lane, but failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 either did not look or looked but did not see the approaching V2 (the 1990 Oldsmobile Delta 88). This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and make a safe turn is considered inadequate surveillance and is a driver-related factor. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was also thinking about a family problem, which may have distracted them further.
