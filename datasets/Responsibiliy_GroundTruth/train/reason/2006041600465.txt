The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was attempting to make a lane change from lane two into lane one without adequately surveilling the surrounding traffic. This resulted in V1 encroaching into the path of V2 (the Nissan Quest), causing a collision. The witness at the scene also confirmed that V1 was changing lanes from lane two into lane one. Therefore, V1's failure to properly check for other vehicles and safely execute the lane change makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
