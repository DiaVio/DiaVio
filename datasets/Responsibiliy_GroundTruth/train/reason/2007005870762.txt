The reason for V1's responsibility is that the vehicle lost control and yawed in a clockwise direction while negotiating the left curve. This indicates that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the wet road surface. The fact that V1 crossed over into the opposite lane before returning to its original travel lane further suggests that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle while navigating the curve. Without an interview with the driver, it is uncertain if any other factors such as fatigue or health-related issues contributed to the crash. However, the critical pre-crash event and reason coded for V1 indicate that the primary cause of the crash was the driver's excessive speed for the curve and the wet road conditions.
