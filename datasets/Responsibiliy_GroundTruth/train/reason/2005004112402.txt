The reason for this is that V2, the driver of the Ford Taurus, failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver stated that she stopped at the stop sign and looked in both directions, but her view was obstructed by a fence and landscaping. Despite the obstruction, she proceeded to turn left and was subsequently struck by V1, the Hyundai Elantra. While V1, the driver of the Hyundai Elantra, also had associated factors such as physical ailments and taking medications, it is important to note that V2 had a critical reason for the pre-crash event, which was the environmental factor of view obstruction. Additionally, V2 was conversing with a passenger and was unlicensed, indicating a recognition factor and a violation of traffic laws. Therefore, V2's failure to adequately survey the intersection and proceed with caution, along with the recognition factor and violation of traffic laws, make V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
