The reason for this is that V2 initiated a lane change without ensuring that it was safe to do so, encroaching into V1's travel lane. This forced the driver of V1 to take evasive action by steering left to avoid a collision. As a result of this sudden maneuver, V1 lost control and collided with the median wall. While the driver of V1 could be considered partially responsible for overcompensating, the main factor that led to the crash was the unsafe lane change by V2.
