The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver, who was on a learner's permit and inexperienced, failed to properly execute a left turn at the intersection. Instead of straightening out the steering wheel after making the left turn, V1 continued in a left turn maneuver, crossing the centerline of the north-south road and entering the path of Vehicle two (V2). This action by the driver of V1 directly caused the collision with V2.
