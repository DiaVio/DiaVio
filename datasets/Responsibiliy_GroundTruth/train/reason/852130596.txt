The reason for this is that V2 locked up its brakes and steered to the left just prior to the intersection, causing the front of V2 to impact the left side front half of Vehicle One (V1). This initial impact then led to a series of subsequent impacts between the two vehicles. V2's actions of locking up the brakes and steering to the left indicate a failure to yield the right of way at the intersection, resulting in the collision.
