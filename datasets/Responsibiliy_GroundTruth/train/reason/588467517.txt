The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the southbound travel lane, causing a collision with Vehicle 3. This initial collision then led to Vehicle 2 subsequently striking the frontal plane of Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 1 attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the collision, indicating that they were not at fault for the accident.
