The driver of V1 was attempting to pass another vehicle on a snow-covered roadway and lost control, resulting in the collision with V2 (the parked Ford M/H Truck). The critical pre-crash event for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the right side, suggesting that the driver was not maintaining proper control. The critical reason for this event was coded as "too fast for conditions," indicating that the driver was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the snowy and slippery road conditions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust their speed and maintain control in the given weather conditions.
