The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, which led to the vehicle veering off the road, colliding with a pole and guardrail, and ultimately rolling over. The driver's lack of sleep, with only 3.5 hours prior to going to work, contributed to her falling asleep at the wheel and losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 made no avoidance maneuvers, indicating a lack of driver response to the situation.
