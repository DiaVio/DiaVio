The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the centerline of the roadway into the opposite lanes of traffic, ultimately causing the collision with V2. This action by V1 indicates a driver error or mistake, as it is stated that the driver of V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. This lane deviation by V1 directly led to the collision with V2.
