The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before or during the turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that she did not look to the side before or during her turn. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 entering the intersection when it was not clear, leading to the collision with V2 (the 1997 Mercury Mountaineer) and subsequently with V3 (the 1995 Chevrolet Beretta).
