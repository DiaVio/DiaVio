The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 braked and steered left in an attempt to avoid striking the rear of an eastbound vehicle. However, in doing so, Vehicle 1 entered the westbound travel lane, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2 (the 2012 Cadillac CTS). This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 made an error in judgment or failed to maintain control of their vehicle, leading to the accident.
