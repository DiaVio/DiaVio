The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that Vehicle One was the one crossing the intersection. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was attributed to a driver-related factor, specifically "type of driver error unknown." On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two (the 1991 Dodge Dakota) was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path." However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to Vehicle Two, suggesting that Vehicle Two was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, based on the available information, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the crash due to their actions of crossing the intersection and the unknown driver error.
