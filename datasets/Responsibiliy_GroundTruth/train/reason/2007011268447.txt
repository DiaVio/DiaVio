The reason for this is that V1, the 1993 Saturn SL2, crossed the double yellow centerline while negotiating a curve to the left. This resulted in V1 colliding with V2, the 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup truck, and subsequently striking the trailer towed behind V2. V1 then continued moving and collided with V3, the 2006 Chrysler Town and Country minivan. The critical pre-crash event coded to the driver of V1 was "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane." The critical reason was "an unknown type driver error." Additionally, a witness traveling behind V1 stated that V1 was weaving left and right for miles prior to the crash and did not respond when the witness sounded her horn. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's failure to maintain their lane and cross the double yellow centerline is the primary reason for the crash.
