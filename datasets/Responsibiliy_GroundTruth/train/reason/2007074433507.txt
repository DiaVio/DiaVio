The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before turning. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V2 did not properly observe the oncoming traffic, including V1, before making the left turn, resulting in the collision. V1, on the other hand, attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes and skidding longitudinally. This suggests that V1 was taking evasive action and was not the primary cause of the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to properly surveil the intersection before making the left turn.
