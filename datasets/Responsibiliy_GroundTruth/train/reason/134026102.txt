The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed from the left pavement edge, traversed the grass shoulder, and ultimately collided with multiple trees, resulting in damage to the vehicle. The driver of Vehicle 1 was also found to be unrestrained, as evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the seat belt system and the vehicle's Event Data Recorder recording the driver belt switch as "unbuckled". This lack of restraint use likely contributed to the severity of the driver's injuries.
