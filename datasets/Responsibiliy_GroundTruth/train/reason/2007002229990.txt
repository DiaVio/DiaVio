The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 drifted left, partially departing the roadway, and then overcorrected by steering hard right. This overcorrection caused the vehicle to roll multiple times and ultimately come to a rest on its wheels facing south. The driver's overcompensation in response to drifting off the roadway led to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
