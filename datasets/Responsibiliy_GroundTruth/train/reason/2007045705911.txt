The reason for V1's responsibility is that it departed the right roadside and struck the ground, causing it to drag until it ultimately collided with a tree on the north edge of the ditch. This indicates that V1 lost control and veered off the road, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he swerved right to avoid a non-contact vehicle partially in the westbound lane, which suggests that V1's evasive action was incorrect and contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its departure from the road and incorrect evasive action.
