The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that he did not see V2 until it was too late. Additionally, the associated factors of the driver being fatigued, not familiar with the area, and traveling too fast indicate a lack of attentiveness and caution while driving. On the other hand, no critical reason was coded to the driver of V2, suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the accident.
