The driver of Vehicle #1 was driving aggressively and stated that he was racing another vehicle prior to the crash. He was also traveling at a high speed of 113 KMPH (70 MPH), which was too fast for the conditions. This aggressive driving and excessive speed led to the loss of control of Vehicle #1, causing it to swerve into other lanes and ultimately collide with Vehicle #2 and Vehicle #3. The driver of Vehicle #1's actions and behavior directly contributed to the sequence of events that led to the accident.
