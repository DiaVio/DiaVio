The driver of V1, a 50-year-old male, fell asleep behind the wheel, causing the vehicle to veer off the right side of the roadway and collide with a residential concrete fence. The critical reason for the accident was coded as a driver-related critical non-performance error: sleeping. The driver had not slept in the previous 28 hours due to being assigned jury duty on top of working the graveyard shift. This severe lack of sleep likely impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was unfamiliar with the road and rarely drove on it, which may have contributed to his inability to navigate the slight curve. The fact that the headlights of V1 were not on, despite it being nighttime, was also observed by a witness. This further indicates a lack of attentiveness and responsibility on the part of the driver.
