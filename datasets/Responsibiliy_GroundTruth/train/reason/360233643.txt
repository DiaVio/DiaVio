The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn through the intersection, which means it had the responsibility to yield to oncoming traffic. V2, the 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser, was traveling straight in the southbound lane and entered the intersection before V1 completed its turn. As a result, the front of V2 impacted the right side of V1, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2.
