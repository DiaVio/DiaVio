The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling north and negotiating a right curve when it crossed the center line and skidded laterally in a clockwise yaw. It then departed the right side of the road and struck an embankment, causing it to roll over multiple times before coming to rest on its top plane. This sequence of events indicates that Vehicle 1 lost control and failed to maintain its lane, resulting in the accident.
