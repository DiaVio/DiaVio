The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was attempting to cross the westbound lanes of the highway to turn left onto the eastbound lanes. However, Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic, specifically Vehicle #2, which was traveling in the left travel lane of the westbound highway. Vehicle #1 pulled out in front of Vehicle #2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he saw a big brown van in the right westbound lane of the highway, which he believed was turning onto the road he was trying to turn out of. This indicates that Vehicle #1 may have been distracted or had an obstructed view, as he failed to notice or properly assess the oncoming Vehicle #2. Therefore, Vehicle #1's decision error and failure to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
