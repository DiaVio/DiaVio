The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by talking on a cellular phone just before the crash. The driver admitted to looking down to hang up the phone and place it on his lap, which caused him to be unaware of the transit bus (V2) stopped in front of him. This distraction prevented him from stopping in time and resulted in the collision. Additionally, the wet roadway and heavy rain were coded as associated factors for both drivers, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the distraction caused by the phone conversation.
