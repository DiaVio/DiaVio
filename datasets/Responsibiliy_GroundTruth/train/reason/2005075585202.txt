The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the intersection, which is a clear violation of the traffic rules. There is no evidence to support the driver's claim that he braked for the stop sign. Therefore, V1's illegal maneuver of not stopping at the intersection directly led to the collision with V2 (the city bus). While it is mentioned that the driver of V2 may have been distracted due to recent life changes, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility. V2 was traveling through the intersection in accordance with the traffic rules, and the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from V1 crossing the street and across its path. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the intersection, which resulted in the collision with V2.
