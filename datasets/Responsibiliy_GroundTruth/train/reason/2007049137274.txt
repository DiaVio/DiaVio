The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. She stated that she stopped at the stop sign for 1-2 seconds, looked to her left, did not see any oncoming traffic, and proceeded into the intersection. However, she did not see V2 until impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. This indicates a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surrounding traffic, which led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance.
