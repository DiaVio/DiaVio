The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by driving too fast for the conditions. The driver lost control of the vehicle on the wet road while attempting to overtake V2 (the 1999 Toyota Camry). This decision to drive at a speed that was not appropriate for the rainy and wet conditions ultimately led to the collision with V2.
