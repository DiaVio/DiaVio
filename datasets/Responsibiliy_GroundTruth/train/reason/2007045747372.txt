The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver chose to brake and steer to the left in an attempt to avoid hitting the dog. This evasive action was deemed incorrect because it caused V1 to depart from the roadway and ultimately collide with a tree. The driver's choice to steer left instead of braking or taking other appropriate actions resulted in the loss of control of the vehicle and the subsequent crash.
