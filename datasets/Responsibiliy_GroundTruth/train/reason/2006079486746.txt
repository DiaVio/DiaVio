The reason for this is as follows: - V1 veered to the left, rotating counterclockwise, and traveled across all four travel lanes, indicating a loss of control. - Witnesses reported that V1 appeared to be making a U-turn or turning left, suggesting that the driver was not maintaining proper control of the vehicle. - Both witnesses also mentioned that V1 was speeding and that the driver appeared to be accelerating at the time of the crash, indicating reckless driving behavior. - The autopsy report revealed positive test results for drugs (Cocaine and Marijuana) and a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC 0.25), indicating impaired driving. Therefore, based on the driver's loss of control, reckless driving behavior, and impaired state, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
