The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is as follows: - Vehicle #1 was halfway through the curve when it departed the right side of the road, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. - The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted internally, as indicated by the critical reason coded as an internal distraction. Inserting a CD into the player and turning it up very loud could have diverted her attention from the road. - The driver of Vehicle #1 was under treatment for several emotional and neurological disorders and taking several medications. The recent change in medication and her release from a mental health facility within the last month could have potentially affected her ability to drive safely. - Vehicle #1 was also traveling too fast for the conditions, going over the speed limit on a narrow road in a curve while trying to keep up with her father in his sports car. This indicates a failure to adjust speed to the road conditions and a lack of familiarity with the road. Overall, Vehicle #1's failure to maintain control, internal distraction, medication history, and excessive speed contribute to its primary responsibility for the crash.
