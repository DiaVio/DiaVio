The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 47-year-old female, crossed over the westbound lane and onto the emergency shoulder while negotiating a left curve. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road. The driver's statement that she lost control of her vehicle further supports this conclusion. Additionally, V1 continued to rotate clockwise, crossed both lanes of travel, and ultimately collided with a dirt embankment. These actions suggest a lack of proper steering and control by the driver. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve.
