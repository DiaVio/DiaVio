The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it departed the roadway, sideswiped a large boulder, impacted a fence, and then continued down a grassy slope to impact another fence and a large tree. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to stay on the roadway, resulting in multiple impacts and ultimately disabling damage.
