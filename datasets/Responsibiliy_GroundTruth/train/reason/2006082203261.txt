The reason for this is that V1 was leaving a driveway and turning left onto the city street. It is the responsibility of the driver leaving the driveway to yield to oncoming traffic and ensure that it is safe to proceed. In this case, V1 failed to yield to V2 (the driver of the 1989 Honda Civic sedan) who was already traveling on the city street. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by swerving into the oncoming lanes, but was unable to do so. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and properly assess the oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
