The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 failed to see the stop sign to her right, indicating that she was not paying sufficient attention to her surroundings while driving. This lack of surveillance led to her entering the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's inexperience as a driver and unfamiliarity with the area may have contributed to her failure to properly observe the stop sign and assess the traffic situation. While she attempted to avoid the collision by accelerating and steering left, her actions were not enough to prevent the accident. It is important to note that V2 (the driver of the Ford F-150) also had a critical pre-crash event of "other vehicle encroachment" and reported being distracted by conversation with his co-worker. However, based on the given information, V2's actions do not appear to be the primary cause of the accident.
