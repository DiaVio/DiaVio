The reason for this is that V2 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 stated that he was focused on his turn destination and did not see V1 prior to the crash. This indicates a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," further supporting the driver's failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic.
