The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a left turn across the path of V2, failing to yield the right-of-way. V2 stated that they saw V1 slowing down as if it was going to turn, leading them to believe that V1 was going to yield. However, V1 suddenly and without warning initiated the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 drove away from the crash scene, indicating a hit and run situation, which further demonstrates their lack of responsibility in the accident.
