The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to running the red light and failing to stop for a traffic control device. Additionally, the driver was only driving with a learner's permit and had limited experience on the road. The driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway, inadequate surveillance, and inexperience likely contributed to her failure to stop in time and avoid the collision with V2. The weather conditions, specifically the rain, may have also played a role in reducing visibility and making it more difficult for the driver to stop in time.
