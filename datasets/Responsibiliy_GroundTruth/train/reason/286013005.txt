The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound on a two-lane roadway and collided with the left side of V1, which was traveling westbound and intending to go straight through the intersection. V2 most likely rotated clockwise before both vehicles came to a final rest. Since V2 collided with the left side of V1, it suggests that V2 may have failed to yield the right of way or made an improper turn at the intersection. Additionally, V2 was reported to have been traveling at a higher speed than V1, with a posted speed limit of 64 km/h (40 mph) for the southbound roadway. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2's actions and higher speed make it primarily responsible for the accident.
