The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it departed the roadway to the left while negotiating a right curve. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road. Additionally, the subsequent clockwise rotation and crossing over the roadway further suggest a loss of control. Finally, V1 ultimately struck a tree with its left side, indicating that it was the vehicle that caused the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the left-sided crash.
