The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection and made a wide right turn, crossing the double yellow line and entering into the southbound travel lanes. This action was a driver error and a violation of traffic laws, resulting in the vehicle departing the road and ultimately colliding with a tree, causing it to overturn. Additionally, the driver's claim of the steering wheel locking up and the steering column breaking appears to be unsupported by physical evidence. The inspection of V1 revealed a cracked steering link near the radiator, but it was determined to have been caused during the collision with the tree. There was no clear indication that a steering problem played a role in the crash. Furthermore, the driver's lack of familiarity with the vehicle (it was his first time driving his sister's car) and the roadway (it was his first time driving on that roadway) may have contributed to his failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign, making an illegal maneuver, and potentially lacking the necessary skill and familiarity to control the vehicle properly.
