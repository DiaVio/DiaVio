The driver of V1 admitted to not being able to stop in time and rear-ended V2, the Nissan Murano. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a driver-related decision error. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 72 kmph, which suggests that V1 was traveling at a speed that was too fast for the congested traffic conditions.
