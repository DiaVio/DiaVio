The reason for this is that V1 was traveling southbound on a straight road with a left curve, but instead of following the curve, V1 continued straight and departed the roadway to the right. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle and did not properly negotiate the curve. As a result, V1 collided with a reflective road marker, impacted an embankment, and ultimately rolled over, causing damage to the vehicle and serious injuries to the driver.
