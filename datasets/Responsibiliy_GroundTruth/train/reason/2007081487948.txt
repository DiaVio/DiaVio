The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver had a sneezing attack, which impaired their ability to see V2 (the 2006 Mitsubishi Endeavor SUV) and stop their vehicle. Additionally, sun glare was mentioned as an additional factor for V1, which may have further affected their visibility and ability to react in time to avoid the collision.
