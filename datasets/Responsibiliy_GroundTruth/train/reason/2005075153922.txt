The driver of V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of V2 (the 2005 Buick Terraza) while V2 was stopped at a red light. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to stop in time to avoid the collision. The critical reason for this event was coded as "type of driver error unknown" due to the lack of interview. However, it can be inferred that the driver of V1 was likely following too closely or not paying attention to the road ahead, resulting in the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop in time and maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.
