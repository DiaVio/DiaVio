The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, V2's rotation counterclockwise after the impact suggests that V2 was traveling at a higher speed or failed to properly stop or slow down at the intersection.
