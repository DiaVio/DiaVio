The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it swerved to the right and lost control while trying to avoid the unknown semi truck that was stopped in the westbound lane. This resulted in V1 rotating counterclockwise, sliding off the roadway, and ultimately rolling over. The actions of V1 caused the trailer to detach and roll over as well.
