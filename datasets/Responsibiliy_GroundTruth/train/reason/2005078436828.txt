The reason for this is that the driver of V2 was distracted and reached down to pick up his soda from the floor. As a result, he failed to notice that V1 had stopped in his lane with the rear emergency flashers on. This distraction caused V2 to collide with the rear of V1, leading to the subsequent rotation and collision with the guardrail.
