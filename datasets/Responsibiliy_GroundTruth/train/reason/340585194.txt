The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver experienced an episode of syncope, which is a temporary loss of consciousness. This caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in it driving over the curb, crossing the sidewalk, and ultimately colliding with a tree. The driver's loss of consciousness and subsequent inability to maintain control of the vehicle directly led to the accident.
