The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and not paying close attention to the driving detail. This inattentiveness, combined with the driver's inexperience, contributed to the critical pre-crash event of inadequate surveillance. The driver failed to properly look and did not see V2 approaching, resulting in the collision. On the other hand, the driver of V2 applied the brakes but was unable to avoid the crash. There is no indication of any fault or contributing factors on the part of the driver of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattentiveness and failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic.
