The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. V2 stated that he stopped at the stop sign and looked both ways, but he did not see V1 approaching. This indicates that V2 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic.
