The driver of V1 stated that she "lost awareness" for a moment, causing her to be unable to stop in time for the truck in front of her. This indicates that she was not paying attention to the road and the driving task, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, a witness behind V1 stated that the brake lights on V1 did not come on prior to impact, suggesting that V1 did not attempt to brake or slow down before the collision. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to react in a timely manner to the stopped vehicle in front of her make her primarily responsible for the accident.
