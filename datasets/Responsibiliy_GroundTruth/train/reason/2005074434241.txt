The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for a red traffic signal, as reported by a witness. Additionally, the V1 driver admitted to being inattentive and daydreaming while driving, which contributed to his failure to see the traffic control signal. The possibility of the V1 driver using a cell phone while driving further supports the claim of driver inattention. On the other hand, while the V2 driver (the dark blue 2004 Cadillac Escalade SUV) was talking on a cell phone at the time of the collision and failed to adequately survey the intersection for cross traffic, these factors do not absolve V1 of their responsibility for running a red light and causing the collision.
