The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that it drifted across the adjacent bike lane and side-swiped a legally parked car. This indicates that the driver of V1 failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle and veered into the path of the parked car, resulting in the collision and subsequent rollover. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt suggests a lack of adherence to safety measures, which could have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained. Overall, the actions and negligence of the driver of V1, including drifting across lanes and failing to wear a seatbelt, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
