The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was operating the vehicle in a near-unconscious state due to low blood sugar. This impaired his ability to act and resulted in him traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, ultimately leading to the collision with the parked crane. Additionally, the driver had previously been involved in two other collisions before the final collision, indicating a pattern of unsafe driving behavior.
