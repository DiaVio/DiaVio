The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve, as indicated by the critical reason coded as "too fast for curve/turn." Additionally, the associated factors of not realizing that caution was required and overcompensation suggest that the driver was not adequately prepared for the curve and failed to adjust their speed accordingly. The fact that the rear tires only had 3mm of tread depth further indicates a tire deficiency, which could have contributed to the loss of control. Overall, V1's excessive speed, lack of caution, overcompensation, and tire deficiency all point to the driver's responsibility for the crash.
