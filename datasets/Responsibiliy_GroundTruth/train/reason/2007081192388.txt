The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve and drifted across the centerline, resulting in a head-on collision with V2 (the driver of the 1989 Chevrolet S-10 pickup). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as the vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 crossed into the opposite lane. The critical reason for this event was also coded to V1 as a driver-related factor: driving too fast for a curve/turn. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from the opposite direction, over the left lane line. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's excessive speed and failure to maintain control while approaching the curve.
