The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 changed lanes to the left to go around the bus and continue straight through the intersection without ensuring that it was safe to do so. Vehicle 1, which was in the left turn lane preparing to turn left, had the right of way as it was facing a solid green traffic signal. Vehicle 2 falsely assumed that Vehicle 1 would yield the right of way because it was turning left, which was a false assumption. Additionally, Vehicle 2 encroached into the left lane of oncoming traffic, which was a contributing factor to the crash. The driver of Vehicle 2 falsely assumed that Vehicle 1 would yield the right of way because he was going straight, which further demonstrates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of Vehicle 2's driver.
