The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding to turn left. Despite waiting for the northbound non-contact vehicle to pass and checking for southbound traffic, the driver of V1 failed to look left again before entering the intersection. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic from the northbound lane resulted in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look left before entering the intersection make them primarily responsible for the accident.
