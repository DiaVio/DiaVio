The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to look far enough ahead and detect the large elk standing in the southbound travel lane in time to avoid the crash. Additionally, the driver overcompensated by steering hard left, which resulted in losing control of the vehicle and ultimately striking the embankment. The driver's internal distraction, specifically being engaged in conversation with the passengers, likely contributed to the failure to detect the animal and the subsequent overcompensation.
