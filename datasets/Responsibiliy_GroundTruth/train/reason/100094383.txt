The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound in the number-one lane and intended to travel straight through the intersection. V1 (1999 Saturn SW1 station wagon) was in the left turn lane and entered the intersection to make a left turn. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 and collided with the left side of V1 in the area encompassing the driver's door. This indicates that V2 did not follow the traffic rules and regulations, resulting in the collision.
