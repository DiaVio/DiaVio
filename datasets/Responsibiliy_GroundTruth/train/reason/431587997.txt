The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 was involved in a frontal crash with a tree. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock, indicating that V1 was moving directly towards the tree. Additionally, the deployment of the steering wheel airbag in V1 suggests a significant impact with the tree. It is important to note that the responsibility for the accident is determined based on the information provided in the case summary. Further investigation and analysis may be required to establish a definitive conclusion.
