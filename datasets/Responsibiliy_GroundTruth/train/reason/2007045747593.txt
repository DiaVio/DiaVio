The driver of V1 admitted that he did not know if he had a green light and did not stop for the traffic control device. A witness statement confirmed that V1 had a red light and apparently did not stop. The driver of V1 failed to obey the traffic signal and did not exercise adequate surveillance by not looking far enough ahead. These factors indicate that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
