The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at an estimated speed of 128 kmph (80 mph), which is significantly above the posted speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph). Speeding was identified as a factor in the crash. - V1 swerved to the right to avoid rear-ending the car in front of it, which indicates a failure to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the sudden braking of the vehicle ahead. - After swerving onto the right shoulder, V1 overcorrected by steering hard left, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and lose control. - V1 then collided with the left guardrail and overturned, resulting in the vehicle coming to rest in the median. Therefore, based on the driver's actions and the contributing factors of speeding and overcompensation, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
