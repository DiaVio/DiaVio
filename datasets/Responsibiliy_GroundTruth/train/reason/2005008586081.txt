The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to not seeing Vehicle 2 before turning left at the intersection. This indicates a failure to properly check for opposing traffic, which is a crucial responsibility when making a left turn. The driver's claim of limited visibility due to a school bus and SUV ahead of him does not absolve him of the responsibility to ensure it is safe to proceed with the turn.
