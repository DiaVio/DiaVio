The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically heavy rain and wet roads. The critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," and the critical reason for the event was coded as "driver related factor; too fast for conditions (heavy rain/wet roads)." This indicates that the driver of V1 was not adjusting their speed appropriately for the wet roadway, curves, and downhill grade. As a result, the vehicle fishtailed and ultimately lost control, leading to the crash.
