The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking at himself in the rearview mirror and being focused on his face. This distraction caused him to not notice that V2 (the Mazda Protégé) was stopped in front of him, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as an internal distraction, further indicating that the driver's inattention was a contributing factor to the accident. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as another motor vehicle in the lane traveling in the same direction with a higher speed. However, this critical reason was not attributed to V2, suggesting that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to notice the stopped vehicle in front of him.
