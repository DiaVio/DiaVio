The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and failed to recognize that the tractor-trailer (V2) was stopped in front of her. This distraction caused the driver of V1 to swerve hard to the left in an attempt to avoid the trailer, but ultimately resulted in V1 colliding with the back left corner of the trailer. The impact caused severe damage to V1 and resulted in injuries to both occupants, including severe injuries to the front right seat passenger (case subject). Therefore, V1's driver's distraction and failure to avoid the stopped trailer make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
