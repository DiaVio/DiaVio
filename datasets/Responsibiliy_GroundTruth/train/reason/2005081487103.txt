The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in a jackknife event. The driver stated that the trailer began to bounce around on the ruts in lane one, and instead of pulling over to investigate the issue, the driver continued driving. This decision led to V1 departing the travel lanes, re-entering, and ultimately losing control of the vehicle. Additionally, the underinflated tires on V1 and the driver's inexperience in pulling a trailer were contributing factors to the accident. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1991 Chevrolet pick-up) was not primarily responsible for the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the adjacent lane. This suggests that V2 was impacted by V1's loss of control and was not at fault for the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle, while V2 is not primarily responsible as they were impacted by V1's actions.
