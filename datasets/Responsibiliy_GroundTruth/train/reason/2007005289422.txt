The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection. This is evident from the driver's own statement that she didn't notice the stop sign and continued straight through the intersection. The critical pre-crash event coded to V1 also supports this, as it states that V1 was traveling and crossing over the intersection. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway is another contributing factor to her responsibility. The driver's statement that it was her first time driving on that road indicates that she may not have been aware of the stop sign at the intersection. Overall, V1's failure to stop for the stop sign and her unfamiliarity with the roadway make her primarily responsible for the accident.
