The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 initially maneuvered into the left turn lane to proceed southbound onto the interstate on-ramp, crossing the path of Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser). As a result, the front right area of Vehicle 1 impacted the frontal area of Vehicle 2, causing severe damage and resulting in a clockwise rotation to final rest. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, leading to the collision.
