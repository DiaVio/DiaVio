The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle One failed to adequately observe or monitor the intersection before making the right turn. As a result, they entered the intersection at the same time as Vehicle Two (the 1995 Nissan Pathfinder), which was going straight. In contrast, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, turning into same direction." This indicates that Vehicle Two was not at fault for the accident, as they were following the appropriate path and did not encroach into the path of Vehicle One. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance.
