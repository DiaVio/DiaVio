The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver experienced brake failure, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. The driver stated that he noticed his brakes were not working properly and felt spongy. Despite attempting to stop and blowing his air horn, he was unable to prevent the collision. The heavy smell of burnt brakes and witness accounts of smoke coming from the truck further support the brake failure as a contributing factor. Additionally, V1's driver was coded as fatigued due to a regular lack of sleep and inexperienced, having held a commercial driver's license for only 14 months. These factors may have affected his ability to respond effectively to the brake failure situation. On the other hand, V2 (the pickup truck) was traveling through the intersection on a solid green light and was struck by V1. The driver of V2 stated that he saw the dump truck coming across the intersection and heard its horn, but he did not have enough time to react or avoid the collision. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be a contributing factor to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to brake failure, while V2's actions do not contribute to the cause of the crash.
