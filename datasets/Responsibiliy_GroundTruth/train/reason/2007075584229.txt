The driver of V1 stated that they steered to the left and applied the brakes in an attempt to avoid the crash. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor - being too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others, specifically other vehicles abruptly slowing or stopping due to rush hour traffic. This suggests that V1 was traveling at a speed that made it difficult for them to react in time to the slowing or stopped traffic ahead, resulting in the collision with V2 and subsequently V3.
