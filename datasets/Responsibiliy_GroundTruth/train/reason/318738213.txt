The reason for this is that V3 rear-ended Vehicle 2 (V2), which caused V2 to be pushed forward and left into the oncoming lane of travel, resulting in the head-on collision with Vehicle 1 (V1). Since V3 initiated the chain of events leading to the head-on collision, it can be considered primarily responsible for the accident.
