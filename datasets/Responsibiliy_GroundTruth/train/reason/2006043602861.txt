The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through it. They passed the box truck on the left side and continued east through the intersection without noticing the color of the traffic signal. This driver falsely assumed that the signal was green because there was still traffic coming in the opposite direction. As a result, V1 struck the left front of V2 (the 2001 Chevrolet K-1500 4x4) as it entered the intersection. V2, on the other hand, had a green traffic signal as they approached the intersection and confirmed that a large box truck was turning south. The driver of V2 did not have a chance to avoid the collision and is not primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance, failure to stop for a traffic control signal, falsely assuming the traffic signal was green, and following too closely to the box truck to view the traffic signal.
