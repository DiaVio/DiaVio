The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was attempting to pass a non-contact vehicle on the left, but the non-contact vehicle suddenly initiated a U-turn. In response to this unexpected maneuver, V1's driver overcompensated by steering hard to the left, which caused V1 to cross over the intersection, depart the roadway, and ultimately collide with a retaining wall. This overcompensation and poor directional control by V1's driver led to the rollover accident. Additionally, it is important to note that V1's speed at the time of the crash is not reported, but regardless of the speed, the driver's overcompensation and poor control of the vehicle were contributing factors to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rollover collision due to the driver's overcompensation and poor directional control in response to the non-contact vehicle's U-turn.
