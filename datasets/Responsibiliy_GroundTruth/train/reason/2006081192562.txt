The reason for this is that the driver of V1 took her eyes off the roadway and became distracted by reaching for her cell phone. This distraction caused her to drift into the gore area and ultimately collide with the Jersey barrier. Additionally, the driver's attempt to leave the scene by backing up across both exit lanes and then striking the Jersey barrier a second time further demonstrates her responsibility for the accident.
