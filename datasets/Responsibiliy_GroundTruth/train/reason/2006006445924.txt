The witness at the scene reported that V1 ran a red light, which resulted in the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1998 Dodge Caravan). This witness stated that V1 did not attempt to avoid the crash and instead steered to the left, corroborating the physical evidence. Additionally, the witness mentioned that the driver of V1 was confronted by another driver who had honked their horn and stopped in the intersection. This suggests that V1's actions were recognized by other drivers as a violation of traffic rules. Without an interview or additional information about V2, it is difficult to assign any responsibility to them. However, based on the witness account, it appears that V2 was not at fault in this particular accident.
