The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically the curve of the roadway. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and reason coded as a control loss due to traveling too fast for the curve. The driver's statement of attempting to regain control by braking and steering to the left and right indicates a lack of control and poor decision-making. Additionally, the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway and limited driving experience (having his license for only three months) contributed to his poor directional control. The wet road conditions due to rain further exacerbated the situation. Overall, V1's driver failed to exercise caution, control the vehicle appropriately for the conditions, and lacked the necessary experience to navigate the curve safely. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
