The reason for this is that V1, the Chevrolet/Geo Metro LSi, rear-ended V2, the Mazda Miata, while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction. It is the responsibility of the driver of V1 to maintain a safe distance and avoid colliding with the vehicle in front. In this case, V1 failed to do so and caused the collision.
