The reason for this is that V1 lost its left rear tire, which was the critical pre-crash event. This indicates a vehicle-related factor, specifically the failure of the tires/wheels. As a result, the tire became a hazard on the roadway and ultimately caused the collision with V2 (the 2005 Nissan Sentra sedan). V2's driver attempted to avoid the tire but was unable to do so, leading to the impact.
