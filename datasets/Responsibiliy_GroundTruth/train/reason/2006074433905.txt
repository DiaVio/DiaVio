The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection while V1 was already in the intersection, resulting in a collision. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "this vehicle traveling; crossing over (passing through) intersection," indicating that V2 was the one who made the movement that led to the crash. Additionally, the critical reason for V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "driver related factor; internal distraction," suggesting that the driver of V2 was distracted and failed to notice V1 in the intersection. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their internal distraction.
