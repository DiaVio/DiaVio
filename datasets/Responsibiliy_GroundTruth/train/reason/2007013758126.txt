The driver of V1 attempted to make a left turn into a parking lot from the westbound lane, but failed to do so safely. The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded for V1 indicates that the vehicle was traveling over the lane line on the left side, suggesting that V1 crossed into the eastbound lane. Although the driver of V1 claimed to have seen that there was not enough time to make the turn and tried to steer back to the right, they were unable to avoid the collision. This indicates that V1's actions were the main cause of the crash. V2 (the driver of the 2000 Toyota Camry) stated that they saw V1 cross the centerline and attempted to brake but could not avoid the collision. This suggests that V2 was not at fault and was unable to prevent the crash due to V1's actions. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash because they attempted to make a left turn without enough time, crossed into the eastbound lane, and failed to avoid the collision.
