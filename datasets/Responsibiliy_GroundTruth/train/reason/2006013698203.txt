The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included a wet roadway and a slight curve. This is evident from the fact that V1 began to rotate counterclockwise while negotiating the curve and the driver was unable to regain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's inattention and internal distraction, as she was focused on upcoming events and talking with the other occupants, contributed to the loss of control. The fact that it was the driver's first time driving this vehicle and had not driven this roadway in several months also played a role in the crash.
