The driver of V1 admitted that she entered the intersection when the light was red, indicating that she failed to stop for a traffic signal. This is supported by the critical reason coded for V1, which was "inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see)". This suggests that the driver of V1 did not properly observe the traffic signal before entering the intersection. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1994 Lincoln Town Car) claimed that the other driver ran the red light and struck her vehicle. However, there is no evidence or critical reason coded to suggest that V2 was at fault or contributed to the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's admission and the critical reason coded, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to stop for a traffic signal and inadequate surveillance.
