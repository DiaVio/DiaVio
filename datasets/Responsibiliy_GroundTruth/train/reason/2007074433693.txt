The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice V2 (the John Deere backhoe) merging into his lane seconds before the collision. Despite acknowledging sun glare, V1 did not take appropriate measures to adjust his visor or maintain a proper lookout, resulting in the collision with the rear of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to notice and react to the merging vehicle ahead of him makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
