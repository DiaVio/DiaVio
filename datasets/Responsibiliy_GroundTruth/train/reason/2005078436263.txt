The driver of V1 departed the roadway to the left, overcorrected, and then collided with the front of V2 (the 1998 Freightliner tractor pulling a semi-trailer). The driver of V1 was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.217, as well as a positive result for cocaine in their system. These factors indicate impaired driving, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of their vehicle and avoid the collision.
