The reason for this is that V1 made contact with the left rear of V2 while V2 was stopped in northbound lane one. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control or avoid colliding with the stationary vehicle. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for V1 was "other vehicle in lane, stopped," suggesting that V1 failed to react appropriately to the presence of the stopped vehicle.
