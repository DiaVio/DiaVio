The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions. The driver stated that the roads suddenly became slippery, and although traffic had slowed down to 50 mph, the driver failed to adjust their speed accordingly. Additionally, the driver changed lanes while negotiating a curve, which further compromised their control over the vehicle. The low tread on the tires of V1 also contributed to the vehicle's lack of traction on the icy roads. Finally, the driver's failure to properly buckle their seatbelt resulted in their ejection from the vehicle during the crash.
