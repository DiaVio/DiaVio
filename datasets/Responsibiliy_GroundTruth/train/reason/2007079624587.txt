The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 veered right towards the west curb, drove up a driveway ramp, and partially onto the west edge sidewalk. This action caused V1 to collide with a residential mailbox, a street sign, and a residential garbage bin. After this, V1 entered the west leg of the east/west roadway and collided with V2 (the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder sport utility vehicle). The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling off the edge of the road on the right side, and the critical reason was assigned to V1 as a driver-related factor of overcompensation. The driver of V1 overcompensated to the right during an avoidance maneuver to a non-contact vehicle that had cut in front of their vehicle. Additionally, factors such as the driver's level of intoxication, inexperience with the class of vehicle, poor directional control, and fatigue from lack of sleep also contributed to V1's primary responsibility.
