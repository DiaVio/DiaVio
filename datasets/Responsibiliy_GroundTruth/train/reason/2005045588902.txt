The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve, as indicated by the Critical Reason for the Critical Event. The driver estimated his precrash speed at 64kph (40mph), which exceeded the posted speed limit of 48kph (30mph). This excessive speed caused the driver to lose control of the vehicle and depart from the right side of the road, resulting in the collision with trees and a sign. Additionally, the driver was engaged in non-driving activities, such as adjusting the defrost controls and checking for his keys, which distracted him from focusing on the road. The driver's emotional factors from work-related stress and the presence of frost on the windshield that might have obstructed his view and increased sun glare further contributed to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, distracted driving, and failure to adapt to the road conditions.
