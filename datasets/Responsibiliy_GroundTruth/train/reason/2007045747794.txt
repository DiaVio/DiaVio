The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted to make a left turn across the northbound lanes without ensuring it was safe to do so. Despite the driver of the non-contact vehicle waving for V1 to go ahead, V1 failed to adequately survey the traffic in lane two due to heavy traffic and sun glare. V1 admitted to not seeing V2 and not taking any evasive action before colliding with it. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and their decision to turn with an obstructed view make them primarily responsible for the accident.
