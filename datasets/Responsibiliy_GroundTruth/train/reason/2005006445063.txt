The reason for this is that V1 made a U-turn on the roadway, crossed over the double yellow lines, and entered the northbound travel lanes in order to access the parking lot. This action violated traffic laws and created a hazardous situation for other drivers on the road. Although V2 (the driver of the 2001 Acura 3.2 CL coupe) was also involved in the accident, V1's decision to make the U-turn and cross into oncoming traffic was the initial cause of the collision.
