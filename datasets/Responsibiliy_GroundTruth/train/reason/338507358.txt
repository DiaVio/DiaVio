The driver of Vehicle 1 made a hard left turn across the highway, which suggests that they may have been disoriented or not fully aware of the driving situation. This action resulted in Vehicle 1 being struck on the left plane by the front plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2004 Isuzu Ascender). Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for causing the accident.
