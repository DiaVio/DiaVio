The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the left turn. Despite claiming that the signal was green, the driver did not look for cross traffic, which resulted in the collision with V2. This lack of attention and failure to properly assess the intersection contributed to the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Pontiac Sunfire) had a contributing factor to the accident as well. The driver was distracted by talking to and looking at his passenger, which led to him not noticing that the signal was red. However, V2's distraction does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for not properly checking for cross traffic before making the left turn. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to assess the intersection properly before making the left turn.
