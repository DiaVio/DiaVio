The driver of V1 was distracted by checking his blind spot and failed to notice that traffic ahead had come to a stop. This distraction caused him to react too late, resulting in the front left corner of V1 impacting the right rear corner of V2 (the Volkswagen Rabbit). While V2 was traveling in the same lane with a higher speed, the critical reason for the accident was attributed to V1's driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and inadequate surveillance. V1's failure to maintain proper attention and awareness of the road conditions ultimately led to the collision.
