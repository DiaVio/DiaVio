The driver of V1 was attempting to negotiate a left turn across the path of Vehicle 2 (V2) when the collision occurred. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, which was traveling straight in the southbound lane. As a result, V2 struck the left side of V1. Additionally, the deployment of the airbags in V1 suggests a significant impact, further indicating that V1 was at fault for not properly yielding and causing the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
