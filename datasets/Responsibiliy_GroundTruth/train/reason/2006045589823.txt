The driver of Vehicle #1 assumed that Vehicle #2 (the 2006 Toyota Avalon) was initiating a right turn and looked left to see if traffic was clear. However, Vehicle #2 stopped for crossing traffic, causing Vehicle #1 to rear-end it. The critical reason for the critical event for Vehicle #1 was a false assumption of the other driver's actions. The driver of Vehicle #1 falsely assumed that Vehicle #2 would continue to proceed, leading to the collision. Additionally, associated factors such as being in a hurry, sun glare, and being an inexperienced driver contributed to the driver's false assumption and the subsequent accident.
