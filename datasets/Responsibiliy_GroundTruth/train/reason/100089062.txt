The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it pulled into the intersection while intending to make a left turn, without yielding the right of way to Vehicle 2 (V2), the 2002 Ford Focus sedan, which was approaching the intersection from the opposite direction. V1's failure to yield resulted in the front of V2 striking the left side of V1, causing the collision. Additionally, V1's rotation counterclockwise after the impact, resulting in the loss of its right rear tire and subsequent damage to the road, suggests that V1's actions contributed to the severity of the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
