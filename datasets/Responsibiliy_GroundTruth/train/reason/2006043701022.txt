The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop behind V1 (the Nissan Xterra) and collided with the rear of V1. This indicates that V2 was not maintaining a safe distance or paying attention to the road ahead, which resulted in the collision. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V2's travel and impact speeds to be the same as the posted speed limit, suggesting that V2 was likely driving too fast for the conditions. Therefore, V2's failure to stop and maintain a safe distance, along with potentially driving at an excessive speed, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
