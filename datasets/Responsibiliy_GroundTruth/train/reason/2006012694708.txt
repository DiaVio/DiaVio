The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a false assumption of the other road user's action. The driver assumed that Vehicle #2 (V2) would wait for the next signal cycle before attempting to turn. This false assumption led to V1 not taking appropriate action to avoid the collision. Additionally, the witness statement that V1 accelerated before entering the intersection suggests aggressive driving behavior, which may have contributed to the crash. On the other hand, V2's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V2 stated that she never saw V1 prior to the crash, indicating a failure to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic. Instead, she relied on the non-contact vehicle in front of her to determine if it was safe to proceed. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to a false assumption of the other driver's actions and potentially aggressive driving behavior. V2 is also partially responsible for inadequate surveillance and not properly assessing the oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
