The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they attempted an illegal U-turn in a curve with solid double lines as a centerline. This action violated traffic regulations and created a hazardous situation for other vehicles on the road, including V2. V1's failure to adequately surveil the area by not looking to the rear (mirror) while making the U-turn further contributed to the accident. V2 (the driver of the 2000 Ford Focus) also had a contributing factor of false assumption that the other driver would yield the right-of-way. However, V1's illegal U-turn and failure to properly surveil the area were the primary causes of the accident.
