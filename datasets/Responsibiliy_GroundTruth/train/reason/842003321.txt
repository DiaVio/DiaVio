The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 allowed their vehicle to cross the centerline into the path of Vehicle 2 (the 1993 Dodge D350 Club Cab 4x2 pickup truck). This action resulted in a frontal impact between the two vehicles, causing severe damage and leading to the serious injuries sustained by the driver of Vehicle 1.
