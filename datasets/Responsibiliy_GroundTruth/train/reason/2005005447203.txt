The reason for this is that V1 had a stop sign at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as crossing over or passing through the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). Additionally, the presence of overgrown shrubs at the corner blocking the view of the cross street may have contributed to V1's failure to see the approaching V2 (1998 Toyota Sienna). It is important to note that the driver of V1 did not return the researchers' phone calls for a driver interview, and the case summary mentions that the driver of V1 was on several medications that could potentially cause side effects such as light-headedness, dizziness, sleepiness, and poor muscle control. However, without further information or confirmation from the driver, it cannot be definitively determined if the medication played a role in the accident.
