The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way while attempting a left turn at the intersection. This is evident from the fact that V1 was stopped and waiting to turn left onto the residential side street when V2 approached. V1 attempted the left turn when V2 was close, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was cited by the police for no license, failed to yield, and no insurance, indicating a violation of traffic laws and regulations.
