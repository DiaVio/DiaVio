The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 did not realize that V3 was stopped in the roadway, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. This lack of awareness led to an incorrect evasive action by V1, steering left into the oncoming lane of traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1's misjudgment of the speed of V3 and unfamiliarity with the roadway further contributed to the crash.
