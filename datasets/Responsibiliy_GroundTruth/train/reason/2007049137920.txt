The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they departed the roadway on the right side and struck the back of V2 (the parked 1991 Dodge Caravan). V1's departure from the roadway indicates that they failed to maintain control of their vehicle, which led to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 stated that they did not notice V2 on the shoulder until impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers, suggesting a lack of attention and awareness on their part. Therefore, V1's incorrect evasive action and failure to notice the parked vehicle on the shoulder make them primarily responsible for the accident.
