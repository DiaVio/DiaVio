The driver of Vehicle #1 was traveling the wrong way on a one-way street, attempting to elude the police. This reckless behavior, combined with the high rate of speed and the wet road conditions, contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver failed to comply with police instructions and did not wear corrective lenses, which may have impaired their ability to see and react to the situation appropriately. The driver's actions and choices ultimately led to the collision with the parked vehicle.
