The reason for V1's responsibility is that she failed to see the traffic control signal and entered the intersection on a red light. Additionally, she was distracted by talking to the passenger and looking for a street address, which contributed to her inattention and inability to notice the signal. As the driver, it was her responsibility to be aware of her surroundings and obey traffic laws, including stopping at a red light.
