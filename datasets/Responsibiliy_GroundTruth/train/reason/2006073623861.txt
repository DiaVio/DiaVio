The reason for this is that V1 left the roadway to the left and struck a tree, resulting in the crash. The driver stated that he began to feel ill and blacked out momentarily, indicating a possible physical impairment, such as a heart attack or diabetic episode. Additionally, the driver has a history of blackouts. Therefore, V1's physical impairment and loss of consciousness likely contributed to the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the crash.
