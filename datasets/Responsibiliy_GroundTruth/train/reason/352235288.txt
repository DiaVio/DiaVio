The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the case occupant was the driver of V1 and the injuries sustained by the case occupant were a result of the impact with the utility pole and subsequent events involving the pole's support wire. The deployment of the driver's side torso airbag, side curtain airbag, and frontal airbag also indicate that V1 was involved in the primary impact events. It should be noted that further investigation may be required to determine if any other factors contributed to the accident, such as road conditions or the actions of other vehicles involved.
