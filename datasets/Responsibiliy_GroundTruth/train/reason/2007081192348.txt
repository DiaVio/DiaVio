The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain adequate surveillance and did not see the brake lights of V2 until it was just a few feet behind. This indicates that V1 was not paying enough attention to the road and the vehicles ahead, which resulted in the rear-end collision. Additionally, the witness traveling adjacent to V1 stated that V1 did not see the brake lights until the last moment, further supporting the conclusion that V1 was not adequately surveilling the road. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper surveillance and react in a timely manner led to the rear-end collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
