The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling northbound in the far left northbound through lane, approaching the intersection. The driver of Vehicle 2 intended to cross through the intersection and continue traveling north. However, both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, and the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the right side plane (right front) of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was already in the intersection and making a left turn. Therefore, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to yield the right of way.
