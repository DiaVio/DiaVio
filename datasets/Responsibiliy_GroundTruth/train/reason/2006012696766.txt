The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were making a left-hand turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. Even though the light was yellow for both drivers, V1 made a false assumption that V2 would stop. This decision error led to V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision. V2 (the driver of the 2003 Dodge Stratus) took appropriate avoidance action by attempting to go straight through the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was the encroachment of V1 into the opposite lane, which was beyond V2's control. Therefore, V2 is not thought to have contributed to the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to their decision error and false assumption of the actions of V2.
