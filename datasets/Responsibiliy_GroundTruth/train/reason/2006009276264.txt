The reason for this is that V1 struck V2 in the rear, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision. This suggests that V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead or was driving too fast for the conditions, as the roads were dry and traffic flow was minimal. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was "Other motor vehicle stopped in lane," indicating that V1 failed to react appropriately to the presence of a stopped vehicle in front of them. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react appropriately to the stopped vehicle in front of them makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
