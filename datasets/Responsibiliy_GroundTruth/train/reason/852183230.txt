The reason for this is that V1 departed its travel lane to the right, crossed over an intersecting roadway, and ultimately left the roadway entirely. V1 then collided with a wooden stop sign post, a breakaway metal light post, and the concrete base surrounding the pole before rolling over and coming to a final rest in a grassy area. The driver of V1 sustained serious injuries during the rollover event. Therefore, based on the sequence of events described, V1's departure from the travel lane, multiple collisions, and subsequent rollover indicate that it was the primary vehicle responsible for the accident.
