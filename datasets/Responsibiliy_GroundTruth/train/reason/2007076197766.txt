The driver of V1 was traveling at the reported speed of 89 kmph (55 mph), which was too fast for the wet roadway conditions and the curve. This resulted in the vehicle fishtailing and losing control, ultimately causing it to leave the road and roll over. The driver's failure to adjust their speed to the conditions and properly negotiate the curve is the main reason for the crash.
