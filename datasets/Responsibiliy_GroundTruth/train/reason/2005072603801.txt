The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control and overcompensated while trying to avoid a large semi-truck that encroached into their lane. This resulted in V1 swerving into the #2 lane and colliding with the rear of V2 (the Ford F-250 pickup). V1's poor directional control and failure to adequately surveil the vehicles in the adjacent lane contributed to the accident. On the other hand, V2 was driving in the first lane and had merged into the #2 lane approximately 2 to 3 seconds before being struck from behind by V1. V2 was not at fault for the accident as they were maintaining their lane and traveling at the reported speed limit. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their poor directional control and overcompensation while trying to avoid the encroaching semi-truck.
