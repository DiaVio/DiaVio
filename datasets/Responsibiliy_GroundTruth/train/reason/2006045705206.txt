The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver crossed the double yellow line, struck the guardrail, and subsequently lost control of the vehicle, causing it to veer off the road and collide with a utility pole and a tree. The driver's unknown critical non-performance, possibly due to being under the influence of a narcotic painkiller and having a cast on her right hand, likely contributed to her inability to maintain control of the vehicle.
