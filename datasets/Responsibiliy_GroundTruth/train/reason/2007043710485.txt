The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to maintain proper lane position and encroached into the right lane without checking her side mirror. This action caused her to collide with the left tire of V2 (the 2004 Sterling tractor-trailer) and subsequently sideswipe V3 (the 2000 Honda Accord). V1's inadequate surveillance and incorrect evasive action contributed to the crash. Additionally, V1 was following closely behind V3 and was distracted by being late for work, possibly due to her two jobs totaling 49 hours per week. Her inexperience as a driver, bronchitis condition, and tire issues (under-inflated and inadequate tread depth) further contributed to the crash. While V2 (the driver of the tractor-trailer) was in a hurry and engaged in aggressive driving behavior by accelerating and using the air horn, his actions were not the primary cause of the crash. Therefore, V2 is not primarily responsible for the accident.
