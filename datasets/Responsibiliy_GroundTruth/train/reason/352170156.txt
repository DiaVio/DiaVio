The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the left northbound travel lane and collided with Vehicle 2, a 2001 Ford F-350 large pick-up truck, which was traveling south and intended to turn left at the driveway entrance to the gas station. Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 in an offset fashion, indicating that Vehicle 1 may have crossed into the path of Vehicle 2. Additionally, Vehicle 1 rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the northbound travel lanes, suggesting that it was the vehicle that initiated the collision and caused the subsequent rotation. The fact that the frontal air bags of Vehicle 1 deployed further supports the notion that it was the striking vehicle. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
