The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle traveling across the intersection and the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The critical reason for the accident was coded as "inadequate surveillance" for V2, indicating that the driver either failed to look or looked but did not see V1 approaching. This lack of attention and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision with V1.
