The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by looking at the disabled vehicles on the roadside and failed to notice that V2 (the Ford Ranger) had decelerated for slower traffic ahead. As a result, V1's vehicle impacted the back of V2, initiating the crash sequence. V2, on the other hand, was not attributed with any critical reason for the crash. Although V2 was involved in the crash, the critical precrash event for V2 was coded as "Other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in same direction with higher speed," indicating that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related recognition error and external distraction.
