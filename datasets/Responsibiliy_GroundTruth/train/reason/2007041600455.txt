The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive action by attempting a lane change into lane three without ensuring it was safe to do so. This action resulted in V1 hitting the back of V2, who was stopped for slowed traffic. Although V1 claimed that he was trying to avoid a collision with an 18-wheeler, the driver should have slowed down for traffic instead of making a sudden lane change. Therefore, V1's failure to use due care and choosing the wrong evasive action makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
