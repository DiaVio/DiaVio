The reason for this is that V2 impacted the left side of V1, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. As V1 was traveling north in lane one and V2 was traveling east, V2 should have yielded to V1 since V1 had the right of way. Additionally, V2 continued traveling forward after the initial impact, suggesting that V2 did not take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
