The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to merge into the center southbound lane to avoid slower traffic. This loss of control resulted in V1 crossing into the inside southbound lane and subsequently colliding with the parked squad vehicle in the west distress lane. The driver's over-correction by steering right and the subsequent rotation of V1 further contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the near-side impact accident due to the driver's loss of control and subsequent collision with the parked squad vehicle.
