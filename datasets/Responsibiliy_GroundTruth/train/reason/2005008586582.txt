The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is the internal distraction of its driver. The witness stated that the driver of Vehicle 1 was looking down within the vehicle moments before the crash. This distraction likely caused Vehicle 1 to cross into the eastbound lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2.
