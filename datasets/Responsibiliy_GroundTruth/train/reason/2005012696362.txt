The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to not noticing that the traffic light was red until it was too late to stop. This indicates a recognition error and inattention on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the associated factors of inadequate surveillance and traveling too fast for conditions suggest that the driver of V1 was speeding at the time of the crash, further contributing to their responsibility.
