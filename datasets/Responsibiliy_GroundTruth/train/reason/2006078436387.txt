The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, as indicated by the critical reason coded as "driver related factor-following too closely to respond to unexpected actions." Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he attempted to avoid V2 by hitting the brakes but was unable to stop in time. This suggests that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to react in time to the deceleration of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the actions of V2.
