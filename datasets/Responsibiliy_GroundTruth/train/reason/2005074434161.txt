The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to notice the stop sign or the presence of V2 approaching from the right. V1 proceeded through the intersection without stopping, indicating a lack of attention and awareness of the traffic control devices and other vehicles. This failure to adequately survey the roadway and properly observe the stop sign and approaching traffic led to the collision.
