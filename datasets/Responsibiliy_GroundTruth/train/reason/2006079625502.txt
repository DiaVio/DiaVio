The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one was distracted by looking to the right to find an opening in the number four-lane. When she turned to look straight ahead, she noticed that Vehicle two had stopped. Despite applying the brakes, she was unable to stop in time to avoid hitting Vehicle two. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle one was not paying proper attention to the road and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two was stopped due to the congestion at the time of the impact and was not found to have any critical reason or factor directly contributing to the accident. Therefore, based on the given information, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance.
