The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to stop at the stop sign before making a left turn onto the two-lane roadway. The granddaughter's statement that the driver almost hit his mailbox on the way out of the driveway suggests a lack of attention and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver. The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling, Turning Left at Intersection" and the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as "Driver Related Factor. Inadequate Surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see)." On the other hand, Vehicle #2 was traveling on the two-lane roadway and had the right of way. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that she had no chance to avoid Vehicle #1 coming from the side road and braked and steered right but still impacted with Vehicle #1. The Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "Other Vehicle Encroachment, From Crossing Street, turning into opposite direction." However, the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that Vehicle #2 was not found to be at fault. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance.
