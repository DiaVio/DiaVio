The driver of V1 was arrested at the scene and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. This indicates that the driver was impaired at the time of the crash, which likely contributed to the driver's overcompensation and loss of control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver's emotional state, being upset about his favorite team losing a game, may have further distracted him and impaired his judgment while driving.
