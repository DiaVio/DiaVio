The reason for this is that V2 was traveling southbound in the number-one (right) lane with the intention of traveling straight through the intersection. V1, the 2002 Toyota Tacoma, 4-door pickup, was also approaching the intersection with the intention of traveling straight through from the eastbound direction. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously, and it was V2 that struck the left plane of V1, causing V1 to be deflected to the right (southeast) and ultimately overturn onto its right and top planes. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and colliding with V1's left plane resulted in the severe damage to V1 and serious injury to the driver.
