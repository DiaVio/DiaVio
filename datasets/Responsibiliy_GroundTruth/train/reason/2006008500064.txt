The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the Hyundai Sonata). V1 believed that V2 had turned on her right turn signal and was turning onto the on-ramp at the intersection. However, according to the police accident report, V2 did not have its turn signal on. Additionally, there are indications that the driver of V1 may have been distracted or fatigued. The driver had just flown back in that day after being out of town for the entire week and had a "rough week" attending conferences and meeting new people. The driver refused to answer the question regarding cell phone usage, leading to speculation that she may have been talking on the phone when the crash occurred. Therefore, based on the false assumption made by V1 and the potential distractions or fatigue of the driver, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
