The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to complete a left turn. The driver stated that a non-contact vehicle pulled out from the residential entrance, causing him to steer right to avoid contact. However, when he turned back left to complete the turn, he overcompensated and lost control of the vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control.
