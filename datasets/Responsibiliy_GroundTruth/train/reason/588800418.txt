The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 drifted right and departed the southbound roadway, causing the driver to fall out of the vehicle. Vehicle 2 then continued on and struck the left side of Vehicle 1 with its frontal plane. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 2 was not in control of their vehicle, leading to the collision.
