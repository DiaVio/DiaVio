The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and reaching down on the passenger side floorboard to get his clipboard. This internal distraction caused him to veer to the right, resulting in V1 departing the roadway and ultimately colliding with a pole and a block wall. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and his unawareness of the wheel movement indicate negligence on his part, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
