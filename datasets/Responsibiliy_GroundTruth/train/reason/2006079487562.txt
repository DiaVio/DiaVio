The reason for this is that the driver of V1 suffered a seizure while driving, which caused him to become incapacitated and lose control of the vehicle. The driver's seizure disorder, as well as the fact that he attempted to pull over to the right but instead drifted left and off the road, indicate that his physical impairment was the critical reason for the event. Additionally, the driver's reported work-related stress may have contributed to his seizure.
