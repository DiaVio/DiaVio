The reason for this is that the driver of V2 attempted to pass and overtake V1 by entering the painted median area. As V2 accelerated and moved left, its right rear contacted the left rear of V1, causing the driver of V1 to lose control of their vehicle. This indicates that V2's actions of attempting to pass and entering the median area were the direct cause of the collision and subsequent loss of control by V1.
