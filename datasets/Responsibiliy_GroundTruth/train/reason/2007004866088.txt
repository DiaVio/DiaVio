The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 admitted to entering the intersection without observing the traffic signal. V1's driver stated that she was not quite sure why she proceeded through the intersection, indicating a lack of attention and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the associated factor of conversing with a passenger suggests that the driver's attention may have been distracted, further contributing to the poor directional control. On the other hand, V2, driven by a 31-year-old female, reported that she was passing through the intersection with the green light when V1 ran the signal. V2 made no avoidance maneuver, indicating that V2 was following the traffic rules and had the right of way. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to observe the traffic signal and exercise proper control of the vehicle.
