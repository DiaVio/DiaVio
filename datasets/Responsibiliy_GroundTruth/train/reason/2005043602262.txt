The driver of V1 fell asleep at the wheel, which was identified as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. This is supported by the fact that the witness saw V1 veer off the road without any indication of signaling or braking. The driver's admission of taking an old antihistamine/decongestant pill, which made him very tired, further supports the conclusion that he was fatigued and likely fell asleep while driving. Additionally, the driver's illness, specifically having cold/flu symptoms and a running nose, may have contributed to his fatigue and impaired his ability to stay alert. The fact that he was "fighting to stay alert" and resorted to buying a coffee to try and wake himself up further indicates his struggle with fatigue. Furthermore, the driver's emotional state, with the pending conversation about moving his father into a nursing home, may have added to his distraction and mental fatigue while driving. The narrow shoulder on the roadway was also identified as a highway-related factor, which may have contributed to the severity of the crash once V1 veered off the road. Although the vehicle was not inspected, the available information strongly suggests that the driver's fatigue and subsequent falling asleep at the wheel were the primary factors leading to the crash.
