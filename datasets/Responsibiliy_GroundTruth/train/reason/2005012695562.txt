The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, even though he stopped at the stop sign. He reported that he could not see V2 due to trees obstructing his sightline. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Explorer) took appropriate avoidance actions and was not thought to have contributed to the crash. She was traveling at a reasonable speed and had the right-of-way, assuming V1 would stop and yield. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the intersection and yield the right-of-way makes him primarily responsible for the accident.
