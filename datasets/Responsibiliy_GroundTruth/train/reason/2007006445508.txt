The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that had contact with the fallen tree, causing it to end up in the middle of the roadway. V2 (the driver of the Nissan Maxima) then struck the tree with its front. Although the strong winds were a contributing factor to the tree falling, V1 was the vehicle directly involved in the initial contact with the tree. Therefore, V1 bears the primary responsibility for the crash.
