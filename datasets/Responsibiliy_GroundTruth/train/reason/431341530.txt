The reason for this is that the case occupant was a passenger in the Chevrolet Malibu sedan (V1), which indicates that the truck (V2) was the other vehicle involved in the collision. Since the case occupant was properly seated in the front right passenger seat and was not at fault for the accident, the responsibility falls on the truck driver or the truck itself.
