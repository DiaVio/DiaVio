The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. Despite being aware of the need for caution due to the slick road surface from rain, the driver failed to adjust their speed accordingly and lost control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. This resulted in the car sliding counterclockwise, going off the road, and ultimately rolling over onto its roof, blocking both lanes. Additionally, the driver's fatigue may have been an associated factor contributing to the accident. Working and going to school for 63 hours per week can lead to exhaustion, which can impair one's ability to react and make appropriate decisions while driving. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adjust speed for the road conditions and potential fatigue from excessive work and school commitments.
