The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 2002 Chevrolet S-10 pickup) while making a left turn. V1 stated that she did not see V2 due to a large truck in the adjacent lane blocking her view. This indicates a driver recognition error on V1's part, as she should have ensured that the intersection was clear before proceeding with her turn. Additionally, V1 mentioned that the setting sun was in her eyes, which may have contributed to her failure to see V2. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to adjust their driving behavior and take necessary precautions, such as using sun visors or sunglasses, to ensure safe visibility. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and her driver recognition error make her primarily responsible for the accident.
