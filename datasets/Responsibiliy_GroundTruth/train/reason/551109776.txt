The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was the vehicle that veered off the roadway, collided with multiple objects, and ultimately ended up on its roof. The driver of V1 failed to maintain control of the vehicle while exiting the freeway and navigating the curved off-ramp, resulting in a series of collisions and ultimately causing the accident.
