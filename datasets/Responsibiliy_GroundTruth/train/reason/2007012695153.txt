The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and did not realize that V2 (the driver of the 1999 Chevrolet Astro minivan) was slowing down in front of him. V1's internal distraction from conversing with the passenger led to an inadequate surveillance, causing him to fail to see V2 slowing down. As a result, V1 was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with V2.
