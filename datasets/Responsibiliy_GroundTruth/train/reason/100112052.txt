The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver failed to negotiate the curve in the road and drove off the right roadside, crossing the curb and onto the dirt shoulder. This resulted in the vehicle's right side wheels ramping up onto the adjacent embankment, causing the vehicle to tilt approximately 50-degrees left. As a result, the front of the vehicle struck the wooden utility pole, causing significant damage. The driver's failure to navigate the curve and stay on the roadway ultimately led to the collision with the pole.
