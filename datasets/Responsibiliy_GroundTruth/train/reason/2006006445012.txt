The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 ran a red light, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was talking on a cell phone while driving, which is a distraction and can impair their ability to react to the changing traffic conditions. The driver of V1 also made a false assumption about the intentions of V2, assuming that V2 would not make the left turn in front of them. This false assumption led to V1 entering the intersection and colliding with the right rear side of V2.
