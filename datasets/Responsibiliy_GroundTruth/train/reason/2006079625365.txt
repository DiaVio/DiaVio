The reason for Vehicle One's responsibility is that it experienced a left rear tire blowout, which led to a loss of control. This tire failure was identified as the critical reason for the pre-crash event. The tread on the left rear tire was measured at only 1/32, indicating significant wear and potentially inadequate maintenance. Therefore, Vehicle One's driver failed to maintain the vehicle's tires properly, resulting in the blowout and subsequent loss of control.
