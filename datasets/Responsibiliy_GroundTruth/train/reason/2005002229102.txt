The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 admitted to not seeing the other vehicle (Vehicle #2) and being distracted by looking down to retrieve a dropped water bottle and attempting to put on her seat belt. This internal distraction and recognition error led to Vehicle #1's front impacting Vehicle #2's rear, causing the crash. Additionally, Vehicle #1 was traveling against a red traffic control signal, indicating a failure to obey traffic laws. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (1994 Honda Civic) was stopped at the signal, awaiting a green light, and was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
