The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over the left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the path of V1 (the 2007 Toyota Prius) which was making a left turn. Although the critical reason for V2 was not coded, it is important to note that the driver of V2 has high blood pressure and takes Hydrochlorothiazide. While this information is not directly linked to the cause of the collision, it could potentially be a contributing factor to the driver's actions or behavior behind the wheel.
