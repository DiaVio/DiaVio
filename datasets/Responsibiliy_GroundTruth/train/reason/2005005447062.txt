The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they crossed the centerline and entered the eastbound lane, resulting in a head-on collision with V2. This action indicates a failure to maintain their lane and stay on the correct side of the road. Additionally, the driver of V1 mentioned that work and sleep patterns likely contributed to the crash. Fatigue from working the graveyard shift could have impaired their ability to stay alert and focused while driving, leading to the lane departure and subsequent collision. While weather conditions were mentioned as an associative factor for V1, it is important to note that both vehicles were traveling on a level roadway, and the heavy rain alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility for crossing into the opposite lane. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their lane departure and potential fatigue-related impairment.
