The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road. He was reaching for an unknown object in his car and failed to notice the stop sign and the approaching V2 (the Pontiac Grand Am) in time to avoid a collision. This recognition error and internal distraction led to the crash. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area, which could have contributed to his lack of awareness and inability to react in time. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction and failure to recognize and respond to the traffic situation.
