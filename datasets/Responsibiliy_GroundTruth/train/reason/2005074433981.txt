The driver of V1 turned left across northbound lanes without adequately surveying the roadway for oncoming traffic. The driver's inattentiveness and failure to ensure that the oncoming traffic lanes were clear of traffic led to the collision with V2 (the dark blue 1998 Chevrolet Malibu). The obstructed view caused by a vehicle in the northbound turn lane may have contributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver's distraction, thinking about getting to the phone store to have his cell phone repaired, may have interfered with his ability to focus on the road.
