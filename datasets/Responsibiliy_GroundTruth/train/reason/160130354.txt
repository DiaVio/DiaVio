The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn, which likely violated the right of way of Vehicle Two (V2), the 2002 Toyota Tacoma, traveling in the opposite direction. The front of V2 contacted the right side of V1, indicating that V1 was likely in the path of V2 when making the left turn.
