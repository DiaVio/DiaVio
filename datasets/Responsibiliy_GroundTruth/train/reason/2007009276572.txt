The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an illegal maneuver by attempting a U-turn across all four northbound lanes of the highway. This action was observed by Witness 1 and Witness 2, who both stated that V1 made a hard left turn from lane 1 and crossed into the path of V2 (the 2006 Kia Sorrento) in lane 4. V2's driver reported that he tried to avoid V1 but was unable to do so, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the associated factors coded to the driver of V1, such as being in a hurry, driver inexperience, and the use of medication to control acid reflux disease, may have contributed to the driver's decision to make the illegal U-turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's illegal maneuver and associated factors.
