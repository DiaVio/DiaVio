The reason for this is that V1 was backing out of a driveway onto the roadway without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other; backing out of driveway," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to properly check for oncoming vehicles before entering the roadway. Additionally, V1's failure to turn on the vehicle's lights, despite it being dark with streetlights on, was an associated factor in the crash. This lack of visibility likely contributed to V2's inability to see V1 in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and failure to turn on the vehicle's lights make them primarily responsible for the accident.
