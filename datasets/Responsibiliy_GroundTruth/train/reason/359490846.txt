The reason for this is that V2 was crossing through the intersection and began to drift to the left, entering V1's lane of travel. V1, the 2005 Chrysler 300 four door sedan, attempted to steer right to avoid the collision, but V2 still impacted the left side of V1. This indicates that V2 was at fault for crossing into the oncoming lane and causing the collision.
