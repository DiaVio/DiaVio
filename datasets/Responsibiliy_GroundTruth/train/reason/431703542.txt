The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 impacted the left side surface of Vehicle 1 (the 2012 Subaru Forester) as both vehicles entered the intersection. This initial impact resulted in moderate damage to Vehicle 1 and caused both vehicles to be re-directed towards the northeast sector of the intersection. Vehicle 2 then continued in a northeasterly trajectory and subsequently impacted the left side surface of Vehicle 3 (the 2014 Toyota Sienna minivan) that was stopped in the westbound outboard travel lane. Therefore, Vehicle 2's actions of impacting both Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 3 indicate that it was the primary cause of the accident.
