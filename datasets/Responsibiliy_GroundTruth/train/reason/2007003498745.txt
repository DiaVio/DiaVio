The reason for this is that the driver of V1 stated that the driver of V2 (the Ford E-450 Truck) stopped numerous times, causing her to rear-end V2. This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V1 was the vehicle that sustained damage and had to be towed from the scene, further suggesting that it was the striking vehicle. It is important to note that the driver of V2 was stopped and waiting for traffic to move when the collision occurred, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident.
