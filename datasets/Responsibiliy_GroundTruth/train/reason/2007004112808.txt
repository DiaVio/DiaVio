The reason for this is that V2 ran a red light and proceeded straight through the intersection, striking the front of V1. V2's driver admitted that he mistook the green arrow for a green light, thinking it was his right of way to continue straight. However, he was incorrect in his understanding of the traffic signal and failed to obey the traffic control device. This action directly caused the collision with V1.
