The reason for this is that V2 exited a left curve and traveled up and over a raised median, entering the right southbound travel lane where V1 was traveling. V1, the 2005 Cadillac CTS, attempted to brake and steer to the left to avoid the collision, but was unable to do so in time, resulting in the impact between the two vehicles. V2's actions of crossing into the opposite lane and causing the collision indicate that it is primarily responsible for the accident.
