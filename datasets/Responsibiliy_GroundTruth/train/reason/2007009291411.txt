The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which led to the vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. Falling asleep while driving is a critical non-performance error and is a clear violation of safe driving practices. Additionally, the driver stated that he felt tired when he left the shopping center, indicating that he may have been fatigued even before falling asleep. The use of prescription medication for gall bladder problems may have also contributed to his drowsiness. Overall, the driver's actions and admission of falling asleep make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
