The reason for holding V2 primarily responsible is that the crash occurred due to a failure of the left rear axle of V2's trailer, causing the two left tandem tires/wheels to detach and enter the roadway of V1. This disabling vehicle failure, combined with the poor mechanical condition of V2's tractor and trailer, indicates a lack of proper maintenance and inspection. The expired state inspection for both the truck unit and the trailer further suggests negligence on the part of V2 in ensuring the roadworthiness of their vehicle. Therefore, V2's failure to properly maintain their truck and trailer, resulting in the detachment of tires/wheels that caused the crash, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
