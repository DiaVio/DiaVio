The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, specifically for the curve on the exit ramp. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and critical reason codes, which indicate that the loss of control was due to traveling too fast for the curve/turn. Additionally, the driver's own statement about attempting to accelerate around a truck and enter the exit ramp at a high rate of speed further supports the conclusion that V1 was driving in a reckless manner, disregarding the conditions of the road and the curve on the exit ramp. Therefore, V1's actions and decision to drive too fast for the curve ultimately led to the loss of control and the subsequent accident.
