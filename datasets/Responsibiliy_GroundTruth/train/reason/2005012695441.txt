The reason for this is that V1 lost control of the vehicle due to the poor road conditions (blown snow and ice) and overcorrected, causing the vehicle to skid across the centerline and collide with V2 (the 33-year-old female driving the 2000 Chrysler Concord). V1's lack of experience driving in winter conditions, unfamiliarity with the vehicle, and overcorrection contributed to the accident. While V2 may have been distracted and upset about her patient schedule, it is V1's actions that directly led to the collision.
