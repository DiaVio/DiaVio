The driver of V1 attempted to turn left into the southbound lanes, relying on the wave from a van stopped at the light. However, the driver of V1 failed to properly assess the situation and turned with an obstructed view, resulting in V2 (the Ford Taurus) colliding with V1's left front. V1's failure to yield the right of way and turn safely is the main reason for the accident.
