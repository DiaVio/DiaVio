The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop for a red signal and entered the intersection at the same time as V2, resulting in a collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep while driving and not being able to recall many details about the crash. The driver's fatigue, illegal maneuver (failure to stop for a traffic control device), and inexperience driving the vehicle all contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident.
