The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and inattentive, as she was daydreaming about her sick friend while driving. This driver-related factor of inattention led to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the road on the left side. Additionally, the driver made a performance error by mistakenly applying the accelerator instead of the brake when trying to stop the car. This poor directional control resulted in V1 accelerating out of control, impacting a guide wire, and ultimately crashing into a tree. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inattention and performance errors.
