The driver of Vehicle 1 was turning left at the intersection and turned in front of Vehicle 2 (the 1996 Toyota Avalon), causing the collision. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 1 was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason for this event was driving too fast for the conditions. Since the conditions were described as dark with heavy rain in the early evening, it can be inferred that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to adjust their speed appropriately for the weather conditions, resulting in the collision. It is important to note that the critical reason for Vehicle 2 was not coded in the given information, and the attorney for the driver of Vehicle 2 refused to provide an interview. Therefore, based on the available information, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adjust their speed for the conditions and turning in front of oncoming traffic.
