The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver became disoriented due to a medical condition and relinquished control of the vehicle. This loss of control led to V1 departing the road, striking a driveway berm, and initiating a rollover sequence that ultimately resulted in the vehicle colliding with a tree. The driver's medical condition and subsequent loss of control are the main factors contributing to V1's responsibility for the accident.
