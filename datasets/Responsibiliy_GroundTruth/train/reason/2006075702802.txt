The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to pass a bus in lane one, initiating a counter-clockwise yaw. - V1 continued to lose control and traveled through the grass median, ultimately rolling over near the westbound lanes. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: off the edge of the road on the left side," indicating that V1 veered off the road due to the driver's loss of control. - The physical evidence suggests that the driver overreacted to the bus changing lanes and overcompensated, leading to the control loss of V1. - Associative factors such as the driver being intoxicated, in a hurry, fatigued, and ill further contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rollover crash due to the driver's loss of control and overcompensation while attempting to pass the bus.
