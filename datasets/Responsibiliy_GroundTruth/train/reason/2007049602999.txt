The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver misjudged the speed and gap in traffic of V2 (the 2003 Dodge Ram). V1 was waiting to turn left from a driveway onto the southbound lanes of the road. The driver of V1 stated that she saw V2 at a distance of 130 meters (427 feet) from the intersection, but believed that V2 was traveling too fast and reached the intersection within seconds. Despite attempting to accelerate, V1 was unable to avoid the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's misjudgment of V2's speed and gap in traffic led to the accident.
