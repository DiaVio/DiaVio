The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted and taking his eyes off the road to change a CD. This internal distraction caused him to swerve right to avoid an oncoming vehicle, leading to the loss of control and ultimately the crash. Additionally, the driver was traveling at an excessive speed, which further contributed to the accident.
