The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the 1997 Ford Escort). V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and properly assess the oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. Additionally, since V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as "crossing over (passing through) intersection," it indicates that V1 was the vehicle in motion at the time of the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and properly navigate the intersection makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
