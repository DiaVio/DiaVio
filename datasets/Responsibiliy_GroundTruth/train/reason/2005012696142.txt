The reason for this is that V1 failed to notice that V3 had slowed down because the driver was distracted by looking at kids on the roadside. This distraction led to a recognition error, causing V1 to collide with the back of V3. Although V2 also contributed to the crash by following too closely, V1's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them is the primary cause of the accident.
