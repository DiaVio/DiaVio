The driver of V1, a 28-year-old female, admitted to incorrectly assuming that the traffic light had turned green and entered the intersection. She was focused on the vehicle making a right turn and failed to stop for the red light. Additionally, it was determined that she was driving on a suspended license. The out-of-town police officer who witnessed the crash confirmed that V1 had a red light. On the other hand, V2, driven by a 61-year-old male, was traveling north in lane 1 and entered the intersection when V1 collided with the right side of their vehicle. There was no critical reason coded to V2, and the driver of V2 was talking to the passengers at the time of the accident. Therefore, based on the driver's illegal maneuver, failure to stop for a red light, and driving on a suspended license, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
