The reason for this is that V2 departed the roadway to the right, leaving track marks on the dirt and gravel area. It then returned to the roadway and began to rotate counterclockwise, crossing into the eastbound lane and into the path of V1. The front of V1 impacted the right side of V2, causing V2 to roll partially onto the hood and front roof area of V1. V2 continued to roll and eventually came to rest in the ditch. This sequence of events suggests that V2's actions, specifically departing the roadway and crossing into the opposite lane, initiated the collision.
