The reason for this is that V2 was traveling on a roadway with a higher speed limit and no traffic controls, while V1 had stopped at a stop sign and was intending to continue straight ahead. V2 recognized V1 before the intersection and began to brake, indicating that V2 had the opportunity to avoid the collision. However, V2 failed to stop in time and collided with the left side of V1, forcing it laterally and causing additional damage. Therefore, V2's failure to yield to V1 at the intersection and inability to stop in time makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
