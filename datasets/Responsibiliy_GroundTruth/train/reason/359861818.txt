The reason for this is that V2 was traveling south on the intersecting roadway and failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign present at the intersection. V2 entered the intersection and collided with the right front of V1, causing both vehicles to rotate and continue towards the southwest corner of the intersection. V2's failure to yield and subsequent collision with V1 initiated the chain of events that led to the rollover and subsequent injuries sustained by the occupants of both vehicles.
