The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the icy and snowy conditions, as indicated by the police reported estimated vehicle speed of 56 kmph (35 mph) and the driver's own admission of traveling at about 72 kmph (45 mph). This excessive speed made it difficult for V1 to stop on the icy roadway, resulting in the collision with the dirt embankment in the construction zone. Additionally, V1's decision to proceed past the "road closed" signs, despite their presence, indicates a failure to adhere to the traffic control measures in place. The driver's assumption that the signs were not pushed together to prevent access does not justify disregarding the warning and continuing to drive through the construction zone. Overall, V1's excessive speed for the road conditions and failure to comply with the "road closed" signs make them primarily responsible for the accident.
