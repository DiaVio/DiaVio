The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." The driver of V2 stated that she was watching the vehicle in front of her that was also turning left and had the sun in her eyes before entering the intersection. This indicates that the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V1 approaching from the opposite direction, resulting in the collision.
