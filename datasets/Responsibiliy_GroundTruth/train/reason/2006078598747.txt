The reason for this is that V1 lost control of their vehicle while accelerating during a left turn. Witnesses stated that the vehicle was fishtailing as the driver accelerated too fast. This loss of control resulted in V1 striking V2, which was stationary at the intersection. V1's actions of accelerating excessively and losing control directly led to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
