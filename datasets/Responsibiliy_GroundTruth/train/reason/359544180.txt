The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it failed to decelerate and brake in time, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the back of V2. This caused a chain reaction, with V2 then impacting the back of V3. Although V4 also made contact with V1, it was a minor impact and did not contribute significantly to the accident. Therefore, V1's failure to brake in time and causing the initial impact makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
