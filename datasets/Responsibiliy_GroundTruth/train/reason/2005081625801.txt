V1 was traveling northbound and initiated a left turn without adequately surveilling the intersection. This failure to properly observe oncoming traffic resulted in V1 being struck by V2 (the white Ford Econoline) which was traveling eastbound and had the right of way. V2 was able to make an evasive maneuver, indicating that V1's actions were the main cause of the collision.
