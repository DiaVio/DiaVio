The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by checking on his ill child, which led to him failing to maintain proper surveillance and following too closely. This resulted in V1 colliding with the back of V2, causing a chain reaction that led to V2 striking the back of V3. Therefore, V1's driver-related factors and internal distraction were the main contributing factors to the accident.
