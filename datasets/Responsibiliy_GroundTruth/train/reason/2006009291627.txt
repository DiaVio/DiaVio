The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that they encroached into the opposite lane (lane 1) and collided with V1 (the Jeep Grand Cherokee) while V1 was making a left turn. V2 attempted to stop prior to the impact but was unsuccessful. This indicates that V2 failed to maintain proper control of their vehicle and did not exercise caution while driving.
