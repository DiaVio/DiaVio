The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 drifted off the right side of the road and attempted to re-enter the road, but lost control of the vehicle. This resulted in V1 crossing into the opposite lane, crossing the centerline, and ultimately rolling over and colliding with trees. The driver's loss of control and failure to maintain their lane of travel led to the accident.
