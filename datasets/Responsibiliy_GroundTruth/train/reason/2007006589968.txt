The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was initially traveling eastbound on the one-way street and attempted to make a left turn northbound. However, the driver lost control of the vehicle, jumped the curb, and collided with a building wall. - After the impact with the wall, V1 turned around approximately 180 degrees and began traveling west across the northbound lane, crossing over the double lane line into the southbound lane, where it struck V2, a 1997 Toyota Camry traveling southbound. - V1's loss of control and subsequent collision with the building wall indicate a lack of proper vehicle control and failure to safely execute the left turn. - The driver of V1 admitted to being tired, having a lot on her mind, and feeling like she was driving in a fog. She also mentioned eating and listening to the radio while driving. - The driver of V1 reported not getting enough sleep due to family issues and stated that her medications do not help her driving ability. - The Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1 was "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating a lack of attention and poor directional control. - The associated factors coded to the driver of V1 include personal problems, fatigue, eating and drinking while driving, medication use, and poor directional control. Therefore, based on the driver's actions, lack of attention, and failure to safely execute the left turn, V1 is primarily responsible for the three-vehicle crash.
