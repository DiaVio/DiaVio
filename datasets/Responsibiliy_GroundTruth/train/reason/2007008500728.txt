The reason for this is that the driver of V1 suffered a seizure while driving, which impaired their ability to act and control the vehicle. As a result, V1 crossed into the northbound lanes, sideswiped V2, and then impacted the front of V3. The driver's medical history, including a recent surgery and a history of seizures, suggests that their physical impairment was a contributing factor to the crash.
