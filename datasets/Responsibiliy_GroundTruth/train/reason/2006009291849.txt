The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by an internal distraction, specifically retrieving directions that had fallen onto the floor of the vehicle. This distraction caused the driver to take his eyes off the road, resulting in him rear-ending V2 (the 2000 Mercury Sable) that was traveling in front of him. Additionally, the driver of V1's supervisor stated that the driver had his window open while driving, which could have further contributed to the distraction and the driver's inability to react in time to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's internal distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
