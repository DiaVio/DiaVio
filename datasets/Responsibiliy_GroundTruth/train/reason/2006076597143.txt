The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by looking down inside the vehicle to read an address. This internal distraction caused V1 to cross the centerline of the roadway and collide with V2 (the motor home) traveling in the opposite direction. Additionally, data downloaded from V1's vehicle indicated that the driver did not attempt any braking action prior to the impact, suggesting a lack of awareness and inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the primary factors that led to the accident.
