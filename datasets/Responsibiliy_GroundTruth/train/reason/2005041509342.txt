The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to stop at the stop sign on the east/west roadway, which was controlled by a stop sign. - The driver of V1 stated that she did not see the stop sign because it was partially obscured by a palm tree branch, but it was still visible. - The driver of V1 also mentioned that her focus was on the intersection further up the road instead of the one she was about to enter. - The driver of V1 was distracted and did not adequately surveil the intersection, leading to the collision with V2. - Additionally, the driver of V1 was sleepy, unfamiliar with the area, and in a hurry, which further contributed to the inadequate surveillance and failure to stop at the stop sign. - There was also a roadway-related problem, as the stop-line pavement markings were worn and the stop sign was partially obscured. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
