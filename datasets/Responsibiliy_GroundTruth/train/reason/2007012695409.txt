The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the icy road conditions and failed to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver was distracted by eating ice cream and talking to her sister, which further contributed to the poor directional control. These factors, combined with the icy roadway, led to V1 fishtailing and ultimately crashing into the barrier wall.
