The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making their left turn. Despite slowing down to allow the large truck to pass, V1 did not see V2 approaching and turned directly into its path. This indicates a driver error of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V1's actions leading up to the accident contribute to their responsibility. They admitted to oversleeping and being in a hurry, which may have affected their alertness and decision-making abilities. V1 also mentioned feeling drowsy at the start of the trip, which could have impaired their ability to properly observe the road. Furthermore, V1's vehicle factors, such as dirty windows, low tread depth on all tires, and overinflated tires, may have compromised their visibility and control of the vehicle. While V2's failure to turn on their headlights and their false assumption that V1 would yield the right of way are associated factors, V1's failure to adequately surveil the intersection and their overall actions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
