The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite entering the intersection on a green arrow, the driver admitted to not looking to the side. This lack of surveillance resulted in V1 encroaching into the path of V2, causing the collision. While V2 (the driver of the Audi A4 Quattro) was distracted by trying to close an open rear door, the critical reason for the accident was V1's inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1 bears the primary responsibility for the crash.
