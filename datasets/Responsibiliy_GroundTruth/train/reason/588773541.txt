The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the roadway to the right, struck the curb, and then crossed into the northbound travel lane, ultimately colliding with Vehicle 2 (the 2012 Peterbilt model 348 heavy/medium straight truck). This indicates that Vehicle 1 was not able to maintain control and stay within its designated lane, resulting in the collision.
