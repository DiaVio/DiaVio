The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was traveling westbound on a wet roadway, negotiating a curve to the right, when it skidded over the left lane line into the eastbound lane and impacted Vehicle #2 (2000 Honda Odyssey). The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #1 was coded as "Vehicle Control Loss Due to Traveling Too Fast for Conditions" and the critical reason for this event was "Decision Error, Too fast for curve/turn." The driver of Vehicle #1 initially stated that he did not think he was traveling too fast for the weather conditions, but later admitted that he probably was. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 made a decision error by not adjusting his speed appropriately for the wet conditions and the curve in the roadway. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle #2 was coded as "Other Motor Vehicle in Lane," with no critical reason coded to this vehicle. This suggests that Vehicle #2 was not at fault for the crash and was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time when Vehicle #1 skidded into its path. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's decision error of traveling too fast for the wet conditions and the curve in the roadway.
