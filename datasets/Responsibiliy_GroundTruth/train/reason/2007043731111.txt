The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop when its signal turned red and entered the intersection, colliding with V1. V2 also had precrash skid marks in its lane, indicating an attempt to stop before the collision. Additionally, V2's driver admitted to not noticing the colors of the traffic signal when entering the intersection, suggesting a lack of attention and awareness. While V1 made a false assumption that V2 would yield right-of-way, V2's failure to stop for the red signal and its inattention and inexperience with the vehicle and roadway contribute to its primary responsibility for the accident.
