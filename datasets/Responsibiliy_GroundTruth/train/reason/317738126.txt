The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to notice the vehicles in front of her slowing down and was unable to steer and brake in time to avoid colliding with V2 (the 2012 Toyota Camry). This resulted in a chain reaction where V2 was pushed into the rear of V3 (the 2014 Toyota Highlander). Additionally, V1 veered off the road and collided with multiple objects, including trees, after the initial impact. This suggests a lack of control and failure to maintain proper distance and attention to the road. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was unrestrained, which may have contributed to the severity of her injuries. Overall, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to react in time and maintain control of her vehicle.
