The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included heavy rain and standing water on the roadway. This caused the vehicle to lose control and fishtail, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2 (the Chrysler minivan). V1's failure to adjust their speed to the road conditions and maintain control of their vehicle led to the crash.
