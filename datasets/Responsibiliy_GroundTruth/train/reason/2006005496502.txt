The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection and impacted the left tire well area of V2 (the Toyota Camry), indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Additionally, the Critical Pre-Crash Event for V1 was coded as an illegal maneuver, suggesting that V1 may have run a red light or violated traffic laws. The adverse atmospheric condition of heavy rain and wet roadway may have contributed to the accident, but ultimately, it was V1's failure to yield and engage in an illegal maneuver that led to the collision.
