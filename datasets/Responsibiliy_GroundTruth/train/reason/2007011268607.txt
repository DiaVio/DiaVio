The reason for this is that V1 made a false assumption about the actions of V2 (the driver of the pickup truck). V1 assumed that V2 would stop when their light was about to turn red, but V2 accelerated to go through the light instead. V1 did not take any avoidance actions and pulled out in front of V2, resulting in the collision. While V2 had a Breathalyzer result of .1 and possible side effects from prescribed medication, these factors were not identified as contributing to the critical pre-crash event. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making a false assumption about the actions of V2.
