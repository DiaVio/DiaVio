The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the Toyota Tacoma) and struck the rear of V2 with its front. The driver of V1 was likely distracted, as remnants of food and possible vomit were observed on the passenger side floorboard, indicating that she may have been eating while driving. Additionally, the rush hour congestion may have contributed to the driver's failure to stop in time. On the other hand, V2 was stopped behind heavy traffic with his foot on the brake for about four seconds when he was suddenly struck by V1. V2 was not aware that he was going to be hit and there is no indication of any contributing factors on his part. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her failure to stop and the potential distraction caused by eating while driving.
