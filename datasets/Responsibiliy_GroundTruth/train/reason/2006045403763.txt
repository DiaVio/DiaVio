The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was distracted and not paying attention to the road. She admitted to briefly looking away and reaching for the radio while changing lanes. When she looked up, V2 was stopped in front of her, and she did not have enough time to respond or brake, resulting in the collision. This distraction and failure to maintain proper awareness of the road conditions led to the accident.
