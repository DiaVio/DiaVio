The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left-hand turn in front of V2, failing to yield the right-of-way. The driver of V1 was distracted by talking on her cell phone and admitted that this distraction caused her to be disoriented and not pay attention to the roadway. She followed another vehicle through the intersection without realizing that oncoming traffic had the right-of-way. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not see V2 until the impact occurred, indicating a lack of proper surveillance. The driver's inexperience and being unfamiliar with the roadway also contributed to the accident.
