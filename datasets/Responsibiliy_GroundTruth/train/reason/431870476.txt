The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was proceeding straight in the inboard through lane, while Vehicle 1 (2013 Toyota Prius V 4-door hatchback) was in the inboard left turn lane on approach to the intersection. Vehicle 2's right front side surface was impacted by the front left area of Vehicle 1, indicating that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was making a left turn. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the two vehicles.
