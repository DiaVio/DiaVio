The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a performance error by overcorrecting after leaving the roadway to the right. This overcorrection caused the vehicle to enter a counterclockwise rotation and ultimately roll off the roadway. The driver's excessive speed and overcorrection made the crash inevitable. Additionally, associative factors such as the driver's potential distraction from the police car behind him, fatigue from driving a long distance, and the possibility of alcohol involvement may have contributed to the crash. However, without the availability of BAC test results, it cannot be definitively determined if alcohol was a factor.
