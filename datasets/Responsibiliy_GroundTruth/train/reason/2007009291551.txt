The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, ran a red light, and was involved in a police pursuit. The driver of V1 also had false tags, was unlicensed, and was engaging in aggressive driving behavior. Additionally, the driver of V1 failed to yield to V2, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way.
