The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to realize that V2 had stopped in front of them until they saw another non-contact vehicle driving onto the shoulder to pass V2. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying enough attention to the road ahead and did not maintain a safe following distance. Additionally, the driver of V1 was coded as traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others, which further supports their responsibility for the accident. On the other hand, the driver of V2 noticed the non-contact vehicle driving around her but did not see V1 prior to the crash. This suggests that the driver of V2 was not aware of the approaching vehicle and did not contribute to the cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and not being attentive to the road ahead.
