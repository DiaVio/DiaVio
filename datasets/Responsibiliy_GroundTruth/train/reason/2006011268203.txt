The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver admitted to not seeing V2 (the 2001 Dodge Stratus) coming over the hill until it was too late to avoid the collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area and did not take into account the sight restriction caused by the driveway's proximity to the crest of the hill. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming traffic, combined with the driver's unfamiliarity with the area, led to the collision.
