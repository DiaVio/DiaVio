The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn from a parking lot onto a six-lane trafficway. It failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle Two (V2), the 2003 Ford F150 pickup truck, which was traveling west in lane three of the roadway. The front of V2 contacted the left side of V1, indicating that V1 was in the path of V2 and did not give enough time or space for V2 to avoid the collision.
