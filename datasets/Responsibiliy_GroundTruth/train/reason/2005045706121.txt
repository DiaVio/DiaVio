The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to come to a complete stop at the stop sign, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1 had a recognition error, specifically inadequate surveillance, as they either failed to look or looked but did not see the approaching Vehicle 2 (V2). - V1 was fatigued and running tight on time, which may have affected their ability to properly assess the situation. - V1 was under work stress and had not taken a day off in a significant amount of time, which could have contributed to their lack of focus and attention on the road. These factors indicate that V1's actions and behavior were the primary cause of the accident.
