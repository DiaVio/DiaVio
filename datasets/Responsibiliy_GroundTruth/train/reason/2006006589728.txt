The reason for this is that V1 crossed over the double yellow lines onto the northbound opposing traffic lane, resulting in a head-on collision with V2 (the driver of the 1994 Mercury Grand Marquis). V1's brakes were dysfunctional, which was a vehicle-related factor that contributed to the accident. V2 was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any associated factors that contributed to the crash.
