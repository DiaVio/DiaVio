The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, as indicated by the open 12 pack of beer found in the vehicle and the statement from the owner that the driver had been drinking earlier that morning. This impaired the driver's ability to safely operate the vehicle and make appropriate decisions while driving. Additionally, the driver was distracted by talking on a cell phone, which further compromised their attention and focus on the road. The driver's overcompensation after driving off the left edge of the roadway ultimately led to the vehicle spinning out of control and causing the crash.
