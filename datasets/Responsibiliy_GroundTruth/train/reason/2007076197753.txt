The reason for this is that V1's driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn, which was identified as the critical reason for the crash. The witness's observation of V1 traveling at a speed of 80-89 kph (50-55 mph) prior to the crash supports this finding. Additionally, the driver's claim of steering left to avoid a rock on the road, which was not found by the investigating officer, suggests a lack of attention and possibly aggressive driving behavior. Therefore, V1's driver's failure to maintain an appropriate speed for the curve and potentially engaging in aggressive driving makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
