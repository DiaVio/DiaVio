The reason for this is that V1 was exiting the north/south driveway and attempting to make a left turn onto the east/west roadway. However, V1 failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 1994 Kia Sephia sedan) traveling westbound in the number one lane of the east/west roadway. V1's inadequate surveillance is identified as the critical driver-related factor in this case.
