The driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the curve and lost control of her vehicle on the wet pavement. This caused V1 to spin counterclockwise and cross over the centerline, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2003 Ford Ranger pick-up). The driver of V1 did not take any avoidance actions, indicating a lack of attentiveness or awareness of the situation. Additionally, the driver of V1 was not familiar with the area and may not have realized the caution required for negotiating the curve. The combination of these factors, including the driver's aggressive act of speeding, the wet road conditions, and the cloudy/rainy atmospheric conditions, contributed to the loss of control and subsequent collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to traveling too fast for the curve and failing to exercise caution in the given conditions.
