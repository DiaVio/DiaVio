The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 lost control on the snow-covered road and departed its lane, encroaching into the lane of Vehicle 1 (the 2011 Toyota Tacoma compact pickup). This indicates that Vehicle 2 was unable to maintain control and stay within its designated lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 1.
