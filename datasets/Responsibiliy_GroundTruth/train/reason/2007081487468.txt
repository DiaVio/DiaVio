The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, resulting in a collision with V2 (the Volkswagen Jetta). V1 stated that they checked for cross traffic but did not see any approaching vehicles. However, V2 had the right of way as they were traveling on the uncontrolled north-south roadway. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
