The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the information provided, it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1 (Mercedes 300E) which was traveling straight in the northbound lane. Vehicle 2 proceeded into the intersection and collided with the left side of Vehicle 1. Although Vehicle 1 was reported to be traveling at the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph), it is the responsibility of the turning vehicle (Vehicle 2) to ensure that it is safe to make the turn and yield to oncoming traffic. Vehicle 2 claimed to have waited for the left turn light to turn green, but it seems that it failed to properly assess the situation and did not see the approaching Vehicle 1. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to its failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn at the intersection.
