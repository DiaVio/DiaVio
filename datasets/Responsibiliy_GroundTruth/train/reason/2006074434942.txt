The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver knowingly operated a vehicle with degraded brakes. The driver was aware of the brake issue and attempted to brake while traveling downhill, but the vehicle did not slow down. Instead of stopping or finding a safe place to pull over, the driver made a right turn into an alley to avoid reaching the intersection without brakes. However, the driver lost control of the vehicle and collided with a building. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's poor decision-making and failure to properly address the known brake issue.
