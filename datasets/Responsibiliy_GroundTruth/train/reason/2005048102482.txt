The driver of V1 failed to notice that V2 (the 2003 Pontiac Grand Am) was stopped in front of them, resulting in a rear-end collision. The driver of V1 was distracted by looking for street signs and conversing with the occupants of the vehicle, which contributed to the driver's failure to notice the stopped vehicle. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway and fatigued from a long drive, further impairing their ability to react in time to avoid the collision.
