The reason for this is that V1's vehicle had a critical pre-crash event attributed to it, specifically a vehicle-related factor of degraded braking capability. This suggests that V1's truck had faulty brakes, which likely contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time and avoid colliding with V2 (the Nissan Sentra) in front of them. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain proper braking capability and stop in time is the main reason for the crash.
