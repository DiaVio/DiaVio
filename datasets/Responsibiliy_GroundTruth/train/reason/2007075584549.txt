The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling in lane three and attempted to steer to the right to avoid a collision with V2, who was traveling slower in front of them. - However, V1's attempt to avoid the crash was unsuccessful, and they ended up striking the rear of the trailer on V2. - After the initial impact, V1 entered lane two, into the path of V3, and was subsequently struck by V3. - V1's failure to maintain control of their vehicle and avoid colliding with V2, as well as their subsequent entry into the path of V3, indicates a lack of proper attention and control on the part of the driver. - The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and daydreaming at the time of the crash, which further supports their primary responsibility for the accident. It should be noted that V2, the unknown hit and run heavy truck, also played a role in the crash by traveling slower in front of V1 and potentially not being aware of the collision. However, since V2 left the scene and was not interviewed, it is not possible to assign primary responsibility to them based on the available information.
