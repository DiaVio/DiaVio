The reason for this is that V1 drifted off the road edge while entering a left-hand curve, crossed into the oncoming traffic lane, and then steered hard right, causing the vehicle to rotate clockwise. V1 then steered right off the road edge again, before steering hard left and re-entering the roadway, rotating counterclockwise. This series of steering maneuvers resulted in V1 skidding sideways across the southbound lane and ultimately rolling over. The driver of V1 exhibited poor directional control of the vehicle, and it is unknown why the driver initially departed the right side of the road. Therefore, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event was coded as "type driver error unknown."
