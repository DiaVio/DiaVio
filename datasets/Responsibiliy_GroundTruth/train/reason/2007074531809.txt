The driver of V1 stated that she was distracted by two police officers standing off the right side of the road and did not realize that V2 was stopped in front of her until the last second. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not paying proper attention to the road and failed to maintain a safe following distance, resulting in the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction and failure to maintain a safe speed and distance.
