The reason for this is that V1 was driving with a temporary use only spare tire on the left rear, which may have affected the vehicle's stability and handling. Additionally, the remaining three tires on the vehicle were oversized, which could have further compromised the vehicle's performance. Furthermore, V1 was talking on his cell phone while driving, which is a distraction and can significantly impair a driver's ability to focus on the road. This distraction likely contributed to V1 losing control of the vehicle while negotiating the curve. Lastly, V1 stated that he was unfamiliar with the roadway, but later contradicted himself by saying he drives the route daily. This inconsistency raises questions about V1's attentiveness and awareness while driving. Overall, V1's inexperience, use of a temporary spare tire, oversized tires, and distraction from talking on the cell phone all played a role in the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
