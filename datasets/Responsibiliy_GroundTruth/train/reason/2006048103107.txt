The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed (72 kmph or 45 mph) than V2 (32 kmph or 20 mph) and was unable to stop in time to avoid a collision when V2 suddenly stopped. The critical reason for V1 was identified as being too fast to respond to unexpected actions of others. V1 expected V2 to continue forward and was unable to react in time after realizing that V2 had stopped in the traffic lane. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and adjust her speed accordingly makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
