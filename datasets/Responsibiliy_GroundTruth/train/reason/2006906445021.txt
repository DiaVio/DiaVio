The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle while attempting to avoid another vehicle that ran a red light. This loss of control caused V1 to cross into the westbound travel lane and ultimately collide with V2 (the parked Nissan Maxima) and V3 (the parked Ford Windstar).
