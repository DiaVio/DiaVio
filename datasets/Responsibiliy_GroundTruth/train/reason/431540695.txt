The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was westbound and negotiating a left curve when the driver's vision became obstructed by snow from an eastbound snow plow. Subsequent steering maneuvers by the driver resulted in Vehicle 1 crossing into the eastbound travel lane and colliding with Vehicle 2 (the 2007 Mercedes Benz GL450 4-door sport utility). This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain control of their vehicle and caused the collision.
