The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 failed to adequately observe and assess the traffic conditions before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V2. V2 (the driver of the 2002 Dodge Intrepid) had the right of way as she was traveling straight in her lane. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V1 encroached into V2's lane while making the left turn. However, V2's inadequate surveillance was an associated factor in the crash, suggesting that she could have potentially taken additional measures to avoid the collision. Overall, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic while making the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
