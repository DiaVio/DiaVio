The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding. The driver stated that she looked both ways at the intersection and saw no traffic, but she failed to notice V2 approaching from the north. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 entering the intersection and colliding with the left side of V2. Additionally, there was a sightline restriction caused by a large tree located in the southwest corner of the intersection. This tree could have potentially obstructed the driver's view of V2 approaching from the north. However, it is still the responsibility of the driver of V1 to ensure that it is safe to proceed before entering the intersection, regardless of any sightline restrictions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to notice the oncoming vehicle.
