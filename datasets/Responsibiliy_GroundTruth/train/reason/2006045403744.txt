The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, cocaine, and marijuana, impairing his ability to drive safely. He admitted to going too fast and losing control of the vehicle, which resulted in him crossing the centerline, driving off the road, and ultimately crashing into trees and coming to rest in a wooded area. The driver's impaired state and poor directional control indicate that he was not in control of the vehicle, making him primarily responsible for the accident.
