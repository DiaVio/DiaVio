The driver of V1 initiated a u-turn without sufficient room and lost control of the vehicle. The driver admitted to panicking and did not attempt to regain control of the vehicle during the u-turn. Additionally, the driver was talking on her cell phone at the time of the crash, which was a driver-related factor. The driver's inexperience, as she had only been driving for four months, was also a contributing factor.
