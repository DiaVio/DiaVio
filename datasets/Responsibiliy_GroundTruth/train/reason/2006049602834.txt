The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to turn left at the intersection, which means they were required to yield to oncoming traffic. V1, traveling west in the fourth lane, had the right of way and should not have been encroached upon by V2. Additionally, the critical reason for V2's actions was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically a type of driver error that is unknown. This suggests that V2 may have made an error in judgment or failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before attempting the left turn.
