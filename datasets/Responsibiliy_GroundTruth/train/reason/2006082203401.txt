The reason for this is that V1 attempted to make a U-turn from the southbound lane into the northbound lane, which resulted in V2 (the driver of the 1995 Dodge Caravan) colliding with the right side of V1. V2 stated that there was no time to attempt any avoidance maneuvers, indicating that V1's U-turn was abrupt and unexpected. Therefore, V1's decision to make a U-turn in the path of oncoming traffic is the primary cause of the accident.
