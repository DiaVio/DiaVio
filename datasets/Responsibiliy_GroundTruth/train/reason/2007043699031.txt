The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that he was unfamiliar with the road and was trying to get his bearings when the crash occurred. He admitted to not realizing he was in an intersection. Additionally, V1 went through a stop sign, indicating a failure to properly observe and yield to traffic. These factors suggest that V1's driver did not exercise sufficient caution and failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision.
