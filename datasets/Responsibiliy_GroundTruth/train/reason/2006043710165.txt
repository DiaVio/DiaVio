The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. - V1 failed to see the signal light was red due to being distracted by a conversation with her passenger and reading a map. - V1 claimed that the traffic light was abnormally high and the sun obstructed her vision, but these factors do not excuse running a red light. - V1 also had inadequate surveillance as she did not look at the traffic signal sooner. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic signal and her distracted driving contributed to the collision, making her primarily responsible for the accident.
