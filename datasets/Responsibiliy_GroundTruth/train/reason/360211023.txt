The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the left, swiped a utility pole, and then impacted the north end of the bridge rail on the east side of the bridge. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain their lane, resulting in the collision with the utility pole and bridge rail.
