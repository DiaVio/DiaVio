The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle after the right rear tire tread separated and then blew out. This resulted in the driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the rollover and subsequent collision with the concrete barrier wall. Additionally, the driver's recent modification of adding coil-over shock absorbers to the truck, which are not suitable for work vehicles carrying cargo, contributed to the instability of the vehicle during the tire blowout event. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's loss of control caused by the tire failure and the inappropriate modification of the vehicle's suspension system.
