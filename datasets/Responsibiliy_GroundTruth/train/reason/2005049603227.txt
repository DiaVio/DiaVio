The reason for this is that V1 impacted the rear of V2, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, it was reasoned that the driver of V1 steered to the right just prior to impact, suggesting a possible driver error.
