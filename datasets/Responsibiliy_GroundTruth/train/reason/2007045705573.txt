The reason for V1's responsibility is as follows: - V1 failed to obey the stop sign at the intersection, which is captured under aggressive driving behavior. - V1's driver was internally distracted with a conversation, leading to inadequate surveillance. - V1's driver looked but did not see the oncoming V2, indicating a failure to properly assess the traffic situation. These factors indicate that V1's driver was negligent in their actions, resulting in the collision with V2.
