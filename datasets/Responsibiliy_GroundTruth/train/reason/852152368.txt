The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it crossed the double yellow lane lines and traveled into the eastbound lane, resulting in the front of V1 impacting the front of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1997 Toyota 4Runner, head-on. This indicates that V1 was in the wrong lane and caused the collision.
