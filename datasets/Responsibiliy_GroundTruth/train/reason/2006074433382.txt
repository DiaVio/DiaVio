The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by watching lightning off to the south and falsely assuming that V2 (the driver of the Chrysler minivan) was almost at a complete stop. This false assumption led to V1 not being able to stop in time and colliding with the rear of V2. Additionally, the condition of V1's tires, with low air pressure and limited tread on the left front tire, may have contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time. Therefore, V1's distraction and false assumption of V2's actions, along with the poor condition of the vehicle's tires, make V1 primarily responsible for the collision.
