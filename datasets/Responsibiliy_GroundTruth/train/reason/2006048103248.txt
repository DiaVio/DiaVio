The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being inattentive to the driving task and being distracted by picking up an item from the passenger seat. This distraction caused V1 to swerve into the opposing lane of traffic to avoid the non-contact vehicle, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 2004 Toyota Highlander). V1's internal distraction and failure to maintain control of the vehicle led to the accident.
