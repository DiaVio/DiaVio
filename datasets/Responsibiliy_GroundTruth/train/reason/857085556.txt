The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling southbound and struck the left side of Vehicle 1 (2004 Ford Thunderbird) in a right-angle type of impact. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was already in the intersection and intending to turn left.
