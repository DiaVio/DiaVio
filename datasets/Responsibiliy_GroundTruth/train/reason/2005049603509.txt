The critical reason for the accident was inadequate surveillance, as the driver failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle (V2). The driver of V1 stated that she never had the green arrow, indicating that she did not have the right of way to make the left turn. Additionally, by the time her light turned red, she was already too far into the intersection, further indicating her failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic.
