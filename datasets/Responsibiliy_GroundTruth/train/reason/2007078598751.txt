The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 32 kmph (20 mph) or greater and failed to notice the traffic stopping for the ambulance until he was within 3-5 meters (10-15 feet) of V2. Additionally, V1's brakes were described as being in bad condition, and the driver attempted to stop by braking with lock-up, indicating a lack of proper vehicle maintenance. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was arrested on the scene for possession of marijuana and was driving with a suspended driver's license, suggesting a disregard for traffic laws and safety. Therefore, V1's excessive speed, failure to maintain a safe following distance, and lack of attention and proper vehicle maintenance make them primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
