The driver of V1 was driving with a suspended driver's license, which is a violation of traffic laws. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident was attributed to V1's inadequate surveillance, as they failed to see V2 approaching before initiating the left turn. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and proceed with caution ultimately led to the head-on collision. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Jeep Sport Utility) cannot be held primarily responsible as they were traveling within their lane and had the right of way. The fact that V2 did not see V1 prior to impact does not necessarily indicate fault, as V1's failure to yield and properly assess the situation was the main contributing factor to the accident.
