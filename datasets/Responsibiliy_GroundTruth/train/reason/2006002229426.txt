The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding to make a left turn. This is evident from the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event being coded as "Driver Related Factor, Inadequate Surveillance." Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that she had been waiting for 5 to 10 seconds for traffic to pass before being waved out by an uninvolved motorist. Therefore, Vehicle #2's failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming Vehicle #1 resulted in the collision.
