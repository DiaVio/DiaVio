The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted to avoid a collision with a vehicle encroaching into her lane from the right. However, she overcompensated her avoidance actions, resulting in the loss of control of her vehicle. This led to V1 crossing multiple lanes, impacting the median barrier, and ultimately causing the collision with V2 (the 2001 Buick Century). V2, on the other hand, was not primarily responsible for the crash as the driver stated that he did not see what happened until V1 entered his lane in an out of control movement. Therefore, V2's involvement in the crash was a result of V1's actions. As for V3, since it was not identified and did not stop at the scene, it cannot be determined whether they had any responsibility in the crash.
