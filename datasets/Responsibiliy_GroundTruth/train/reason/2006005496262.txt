The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance (failed to look, looked but did not see). The driver of V1 attempted a left turn without properly checking for oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision with V2. The sight restriction caused by buildings and shrubbery partially obstructing the driver's view may have contributed to the inadequate surveillance. V2, on the other hand, was traveling within the speed limit and attempted to steer and brake to avoid the collision. The driver of V2 did not exhibit any associated factors that could be coded as contributing to the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
