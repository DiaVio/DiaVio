The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a significantly higher speed than the posted speed limit and negotiating a left-hand curve with a downhill grade. V1 crossed the center line into the southbound lane, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 1999 Chevrolet 1500). V1's excessive speed and failure to maintain control of the vehicle are the main factors contributing to the accident.
