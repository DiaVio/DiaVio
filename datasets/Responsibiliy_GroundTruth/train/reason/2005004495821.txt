The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he failed to maintain proper surveillance and did not see V2 (the Honda Accord station wagon) stopped in traffic in front of him. Additionally, V1 did not take any avoidance actions to prevent the collision. The driver's inexperience, as he had his license for less than one year, may have contributed to his failure to react appropriately in the given situation. The environmental factor of sun glare also played a role in obstructing V1's visibility, but it does not absolve him of responsibility for the accident.
