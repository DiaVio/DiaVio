The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was unable to negotiate the curved ramp and departed the roadway, ultimately crossing over into the southbound travel lanes and colliding with the front left corner of Vehicle 1. This indicates that Vehicle 2 was not able to maintain control and stay within its designated lane, resulting in the collision.
