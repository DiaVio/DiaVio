The reason for this is that V2 was traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as "driver related factor; too fast for conditions - wet roads." Additionally, V2 admitted that he "did not look far enough ahead," which was an associated factor in the accident. Therefore, V2's failure to adjust his speed to the wet road conditions and his failure to look far enough ahead contributed to the collision with V1, making him primarily responsible for the accident.
