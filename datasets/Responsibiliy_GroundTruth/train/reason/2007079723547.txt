The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they were attempting a left turn out of a private driveway onto the roadway. The critical reason for the critical event was inadequate surveillance, as V1 failed to properly look or see V2 approaching before making the left turn. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 was a relatively inexperienced driver with only 18 months of driving experience. This lack of experience may have contributed to their failure to properly assess the traffic situation before making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2001 Saturn L200) was traveling in the number two lane and did not have any critical reason coded to them. While V2 was involved in the collision, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to yield and inadequate surveillance. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision because they failed to properly look and yield the right of way while making a left turn out of a private driveway.
