The driver of Vehicle 2 stated that she came to a complete stop, looked both ways, and then entered the roadway intending to turn left. However, she mentioned that the sun obscured her vision of Vehicle 1. This indicates that she failed to see Vehicle 1 before entering the roadway, which is a critical reason for the accident. Additionally, the Critical Pre-crash Event for Vehicle 2 was turning left, exiting a parking lot, and the Critical Reason for this event was "looked but did not see." This further supports the conclusion that the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic, including Vehicle 1. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to see Vehicle 1 while entering the roadway.
