The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling too close to V2 (the Toyota Land Cruiser) and was unable to respond to the sudden deceleration of V2. This indicates a decision error on the part of the driver of V1, as they were not maintaining a safe following distance and were unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, there is a possibility that the driver of V1 was speeding and/or tailgating, which further contributed to the risk posed to surrounding traffic. This aggressive driving behavior may have also played a role in the driver's inability to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their decision error and potential aggressive driving behavior.
