The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that V2 changed lanes to the left without adequately surveilling the adjacent lane. This action caused the left plane of V2 to contact the right plane of V1, resulting in the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane" and the critical reason was attributed to V2's inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V2's failure to properly check for other vehicles before changing lanes and encroaching into the adjacent lane makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
