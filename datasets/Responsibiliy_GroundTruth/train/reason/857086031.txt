The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection, which means they had the duty to yield to oncoming traffic. Vehicle 1, on the other hand, was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. Despite the driver of Vehicle 1 attempting to brake to avoid the collision, Vehicle 2 failed to yield and the collision occurred.
