The witness to the crash stated that V1 did not stop for the stop sign, indicating that V1 failed to yield the right of way to the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical reason for the critical event for V1 was assigned as inadequate surveillance, suggesting that V1 did not properly observe the intersection before entering it. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign and inadequate surveillance make them primarily responsible for the accident.
