The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The witness stated that V1 did not slow down or hesitate while exiting the business drive, indicating a lack of proper observation. Additionally, the driver of V1 assumed that V2 was turning right, even though V2 was traveling in the number two eastbound lane and would not have been making a right turn from that lane. This assumption and failure to properly assess the situation led to V1 pulling out in front of V2, causing the collision.
