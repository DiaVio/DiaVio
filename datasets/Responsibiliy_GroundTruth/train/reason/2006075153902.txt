The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a false assumption of other's actions by assuming that the approaching vehicles would stop. This false assumption led to V1 proceeding to turn left when V2 (the 1993 Buick Regal) was already entering the intersection. The front of V1 then struck the left side of V2, causing a chain reaction that resulted in V2 sideswiping V3 (the 2005 Hyundai Tiburon). In summary, V1's false assumption of other's actions and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
