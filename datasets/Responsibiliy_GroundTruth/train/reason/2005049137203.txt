The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes without adequately surveilling the traffic in the adjacent lane. The driver of V1 admitted that he did not notice that traffic in the adjacent lane had stopped, and as a result, he collided with the rear of V2 (the 1997 Lincoln Towncar sedan). While V2's driver stated that she did not see V1 prior to the impact and could not remember if she had come to a complete stop, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as they failed to maintain proper surveillance and failed to notice the stopped traffic before changing lanes.
