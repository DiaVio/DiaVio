The reason for this is that V1 was traveling in the wrong direction and changed lanes to get around vehicles stopped for the traffic light at the intersection. V1 ran the red light and made frequent lane changes, ignoring traffic controls. This aggressive driving behavior and illegal maneuver led to the collision with V2 (the 2001 Honda Odyssey) that was turning left into the westbound lanes of traffic.
