The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event and critical reason coded for V1. V1 claimed that V2 suddenly stopped for a green light, causing him to slam on his brakes and collide with the back of V2. This suggests that V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, V2 reported that V1 was tailgating him and trying to run him off the road for almost a mile before the accident. Although this information is not directly related to the cause of the accident, it suggests that V1's aggressive driving behavior may have contributed to the collision. Overall, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and respond to the unexpected actions of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
