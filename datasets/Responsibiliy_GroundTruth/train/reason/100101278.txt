The reason for determining V1 as primarily responsible is that the driver became distracted while reaching and searching for items on the front right seat. This distraction caused V1 to veer off the roadway and into the dirt median. Additionally, when the driver attempted to regain control of the vehicle, she steered sharply to the right, causing V1 to slide and enter into a clockwise yaw. This ultimately led to V1 overturning and sustaining significant damage. Therefore, the driver's distraction and subsequent loss of control of V1 are the primary factors contributing to the accident.
