The reason for V1's responsibility is that the vehicle was evading marked police cruisers, which indicates a deliberate attempt to flee from law enforcement. This reckless behavior likely led to the driver losing control of the vehicle and ultimately crashing into the concrete barriers on both sides of the expressway. Additionally, the police reported that the driver was under the influence of drugs/alcohol, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident.
