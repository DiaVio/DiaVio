The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver was traveling too fast for the curve/turn. The driver reported that the sun glare and shadows blocked their view of the roadway curving left, causing them to continue straight instead of following the curve. When the glare lifted, they realized the road was curving and attempted to brake and steer left, but the vehicle slid on the dirt road and ultimately went off the right road edge, resulting in the collision with the roadside delineator, small tree, and drainage embankment. While the sun glare was considered an associative factor, the primary reason for the accident was the driver's failure to adjust their speed and control the vehicle appropriately for the curve, given the road conditions and visibility challenges caused by the glare.
