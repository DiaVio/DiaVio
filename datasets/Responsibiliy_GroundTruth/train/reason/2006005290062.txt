The reason for this determination is that V1 was traveling over the right lane line, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, V1 lost control of the vehicle after exiting the roadway and made contact with two legally parked vehicles. This suggests a lack of control and possibly excessive speed, as V1 was unable to respond to unexpected actions of others. It is important to note that the driver of V1, a 16-year-old male, did not suffer any injuries and there were no other occupants in the vehicle. However, without further information from the driver, it is unknown whether fatigue or health-related issues contributed to the crash.
