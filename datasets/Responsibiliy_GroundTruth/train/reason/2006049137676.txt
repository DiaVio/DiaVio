The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when trying to avoid a collision with the non-contact vehicle. The driver applied the brakes and steered to the left, but overreacted with the steering input, causing the vehicle to initiate a counterclockwise yaw and lose control. Despite having ABS (anti-lock braking system) that allowed the driver to maintain directional control, the driver never regained control of the vehicle. This indicates that the driver's actions and overcompensation were the main contributing factors to the crash.
