The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was fatigued and sleepy at the start of the trip, which impaired his ability to safely operate the vehicle. Additionally, the driver admitted to consuming alcohol and illegal drugs prior to the crash, further impairing his judgment and driving abilities. The driver's drowsiness, impaired condition, and lack of proper rest contributed to him losing control of the vehicle, veering off the road, and colliding with a utility light pole and a tree.
