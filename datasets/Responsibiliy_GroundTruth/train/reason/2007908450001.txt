The reason for this is that V1 was stopped in the turning lane, waiting to make a left turn across three lanes of traffic. However, V1 failed to observe V2 (the Audi A4) traveling in lane one and proceeded to make the left turn, resulting in the collision at the parking lot entrance. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any contributing factors mentioned that would make them responsible for the accident.
