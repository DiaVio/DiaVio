The reason for this is that the driver of V1 accidentally hit the emergency brake with his knee, causing the vehicle to move forward and ejecting the driver. As a result, V1 departed from the road to the right and collided with a cinder block wall and a wooden utility pole. The driver's error in accidentally engaging the emergency brake and subsequently losing control of the vehicle led to the crash.
