The reason for this is that V2 was traveling westbound on the one-way roadway and had a stop sign. V2 stated that he was inching up at the stop sign because a parked vehicle was obstructing his view. However, V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding, resulting in the collision with V1. While V1 had the right of way and was traveling on the one-way roadway with no traffic control devices, the sightline restriction caused by the parked vehicle at the northeast corner was a roadway-related factor that contributed to the accident. However, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and proceed with caution despite the obstructed view makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
