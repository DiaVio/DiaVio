The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for a traffic control device, specifically the red light at the intersection. Additionally, V2 was found to have inadequate surveillance as the driver failed to look to either side ahead before entering the intersection. These factors indicate that V2 was not paying attention to the changing traffic conditions and did not exercise proper caution while making the left turn.
