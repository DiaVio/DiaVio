The reason for this is that V2, the Toyota Corolla, was attempting to merge into the main road from the service lane without properly checking for oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the area and did not see V1, the Dodge Caravan, approaching in the southbound lane. This resulted in the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, the maneuver made by the driver of V2 was deemed illegal, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident.
