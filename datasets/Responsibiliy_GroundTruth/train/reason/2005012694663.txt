The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to come to a complete stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection, crossing the path of Vehicle #2. This is evident from the witness statement that the driver of Vehicle #1 did a rolling stop and continued into the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. Additionally, the witness also mentioned that the driver of Vehicle #1 was not focused on signs, indicating a lack of attention and awareness while driving. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to yield the right of way and inadequate surveillance.
