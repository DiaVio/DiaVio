The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was attempting to elude the police and was traveling at a high rate of speed. The driver lost control while trying to make a right turn, indicating a decision error of going too fast for the turn. The driver's focus on the pursuing police officers rather than the roadway ahead also contributed to the crash. Additionally, the police report states that the driver was unemployed, suggesting a possible lack of responsibility and disregard for traffic laws.
