The driver of V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. They were distracted by watching the vehicle in front of them turning and did not look forward enough to see the presence of V2 (the driver of the Honda Prelude) until a second before impact. Additionally, the driver of V1 was also distracted by thinking about washing their vehicle later and was not fully focused on the task of driving. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and distracted driving contributed to the collision.
