The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 passed out briefly while driving, causing the vehicle to drift off the right side of the road. Although the driver woke up and attempted to steer left and apply the brakes, V1 still made contact with the end of a guardrail with its right rear tire, wheel, and side plane. This initial contact caused V1 to rotate clockwise and make a second contact with the guardrail with its front plane, resulting in the vehicle rolling onto its left side. The driver's blackout was attributed to the medications he was taking, which he believed caused him to pass out at times. This impairment of the driver's ability to act was identified as the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impairment and loss of control of the vehicle.
