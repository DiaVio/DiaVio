The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was driving aggressively, which led to a decision error of swerving to avoid a slower vehicle in the same lane. The driver admitted to being frustrated and in a hurry, as he was lost and worried about missing his flight. Additionally, the driver was fatigued due to working long shifts, which may have impaired his judgment and reaction time. The driver's inexperience with the vehicle and the road also contributed to the crash.
