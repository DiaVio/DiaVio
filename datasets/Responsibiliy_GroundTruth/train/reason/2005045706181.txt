The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 failed to stop for a red traffic light and entered the intersection, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (the 2005 Ford F150). The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to not seeing the red light and failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance indicate that the driver of Vehicle 1 was not paying attention and did not take the necessary precautions to ensure a safe crossing of the intersection. While there are associated factors contributing to Vehicle 2, such as driver fatigue and sightline obstruction, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 for disregarding the traffic signal and causing the collision.
