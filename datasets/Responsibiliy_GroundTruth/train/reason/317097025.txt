The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to make a left turn onto the roadway from a private gravel drive, and failed to yield the right of way to V2 (the 1984 Ford F250 pickup truck) which was traveling on the roadway. V1's failure to yield resulted in the near side impact with V2, causing V1 to rotate and ultimately come to rest off the roadway.
