The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at a stop sign, waiting to turn left. However, V1 proceeded into the roadway without having a clear sight line to V2 (the driver of the Hyundai Elantra) due to the presence of a box truck obstructing the view. V1's inadequate surveillance and decision to turn with an obstructed view contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any contributing factors mentioned in the case summary that would make her primarily responsible for the collision.
