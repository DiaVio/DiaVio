The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. The roadway had patches of sand due to a recent ice condition, which indicates that the road surface may have been slippery. Additionally, the driver was negotiating a curve with a radius of curvature of 188 meters. These factors, combined with the driver's failure to adjust their speed accordingly, resulted in V1 losing control and ultimately crashing into the median and guardrail.
