The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to being distracted by looking at her friend's home while negotiating a left-hand curve. This distraction caused her to drift to the right and then overcompensate to the left, resulting in the vehicle leaving the roadway and colliding with a tree. The driver's distraction and overcompensation are considered driver-related factors, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
