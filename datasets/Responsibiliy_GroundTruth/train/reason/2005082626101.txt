The reason for this is that V1 was stopped at the stop sign and then proceeded to enter the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2 (the 52-year-old female driving the Ford Escort wagon). V2 was traveling southbound in lane one and had the right of way. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1's view was obstructed by other vehicles, which likely contributed to the driver's failure to see V2 approaching. However, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility as it is the driver's responsibility to ensure that the intersection is clear before proceeding.
