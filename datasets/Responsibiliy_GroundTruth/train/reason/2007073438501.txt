The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right-of-way to V1 (the 1993 Ford Tempo) which was traveling northbound. V2 was eastbound and should have stopped at the stop sign, but the driver of V2 did not see V1 and proceeded into the intersection, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2's inadequate surveillance was identified as an associated factor in the crash, indicating that the driver did not exercise proper caution and failed to notice the oncoming vehicle. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield the right-of-way and inadequate surveillance.
