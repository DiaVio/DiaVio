The driver of V2 was supposed to cross the perpendicular roadway that V1 was traveling on, but misjudged the gap or the speed of V1. Despite attempting to avoid the collision by steering to the left, the driver of V2 was unable to prevent the crash. This decision error and misjudgment of the gap or other's speed led to the collision.
