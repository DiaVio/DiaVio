The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control and departed the right roadside edge, leading to a rollover. The driver of Vehicle 1 may have initiated a right over-steering maneuver, which contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the driver was not wearing a seatbelt, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of the injuries sustained in the crash.
