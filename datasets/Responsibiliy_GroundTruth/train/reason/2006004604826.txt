The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted and disoriented due to the previous crash, which caused her to drift off the roadway and ultimately collide with a traffic sign, utility pole, and fence. The driver's internal distraction, inattention, panic/freezing, and poor directional control contributed to the crash. Additionally, the driver's inexperience as a 16-year-old driver may have played a role in the inability to control the vehicle effectively.
