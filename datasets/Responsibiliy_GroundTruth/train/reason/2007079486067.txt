The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he made an illegal maneuver by veering sharply to the right and crossing over into lane one, where V2 (the driver of the Subaru Forester) was traveling. This illegal lane change resulted in the contact between the two vehicles. Additionally, the report mentions that aggressive driving was a factor for V1, further indicating his responsibility for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to his illegal maneuver and aggressive driving.
