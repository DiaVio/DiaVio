The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the road and did not realize that V2 was in the same travel lane until two seconds prior to impact. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, V1 was the one attempting to change lanes and turn left at the last second, which further contributed to the collision.
