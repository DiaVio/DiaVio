The reason for this is that V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way at the intersection controlled by stop signs. Additionally, V2 continued in a northerly direction after the impact, suggesting that V2 did not take appropriate action to avoid the collision.
