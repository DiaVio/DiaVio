The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn at the intersection, intending to continue traveling eastbound. However, it appears that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2 (the 2000 Chrysler Sebring) which was traveling northbound and intended to cross through the intersection. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the right side of Vehicle 1, indicating that Vehicle 1 entered the intersection when it was not safe to do so.
