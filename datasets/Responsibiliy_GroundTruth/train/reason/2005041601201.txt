The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and caused it to roll over by overcompensating after a non-contact vehicle cut across two lanes of traffic. The driver's action of jerking the wheel to the left was a contributing factor to the loss of control. Additionally, the driver's age and lack of familiarity with the roadway (as stated in the interview) may have also played a role in the driver's inability to react appropriately to the situation.
