The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to changing lanes to get around the merging non-contact vehicle and subsequently struck V2 in the rear. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and failed to exercise caution while changing lanes, resulting in the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 stated that a large yellow box van obstructed his view of V2, suggesting a lack of proper observation and awareness of the surrounding traffic conditions. In contrast, V2 (the driver of the 2005 Ford Freestyle) was traveling in lane three and came to a stop due to congestion ahead. V2 did not see V1 prior to the impact, indicating that V2 was stationary and not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to their failure to maintain a safe distance, exercise caution while changing lanes, and properly observe the traffic conditions.
