The reason for this is that Vehicle #2, driven by an 18-year-old inexperienced driver, failed to adequately surveil the road before backing out of a driveway. The driver stated that he thought he had found the right house, but realized it was the wrong driveway and attempted to back out and move to the next driveway. However, he was hit by Vehicle #1 before he could complete the maneuver. While Vehicle #1 was traveling slightly above the speed limit on wet roads, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #2 as they failed to properly observe the road and ensure it was clear before backing out.
