The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a tire/wheel malfunction. The right rear tire's tread separation caused the truck to wobble and shake, ultimately leading to the collision with the left side concrete barrier wall. The police reported travel speed for V1 was 0 kmph, indicating that the loss of control occurred before the collision. Additionally, the wet roadway conditions and rainy skies were contributing factors to the crash.
