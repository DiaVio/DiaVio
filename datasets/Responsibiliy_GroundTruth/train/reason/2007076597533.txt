The driver admitted to being very tired and falling asleep at the wheel, which was the critical reason for the crash. Falling asleep while driving is a driver-related factor and a clear violation of safe driving practices. The driver's fatigue and lack of attention to the road led to V1 traveling off the left side of the roadway and overturning down the embankment.
