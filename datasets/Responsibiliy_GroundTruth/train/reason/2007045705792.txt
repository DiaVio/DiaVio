The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 encountered a non-contact vehicle traveling in the wrong direction in the eastbound lane. Instead of properly reacting to the situation, the driver of V1 made sharp steering maneuvers, swerving left into the westbound lane and then attempting to recover by swerving right. These sudden and drastic steering maneuvers caused V1 to lose control, resulting in a clockwise yaw and ultimately causing V1 to leave the roadway and crash into the ditch, shrubs, and a tree. The driver of V1 was also found to be traveling too fast for the conditions, which likely contributed to the loss of control. Additionally, the driver's inexperience and the lack of shoulders on the roadway were identified as associated factors. Overall, V1's driver's actions and failure to properly respond to the situation, combined with traveling too fast for the conditions, make V1 primarily responsible for the crash.
