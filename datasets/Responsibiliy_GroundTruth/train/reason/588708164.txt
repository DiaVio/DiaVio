The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the right, northbound travel lane and entered the intersection at the same time as Vehicle 2 (the 2000 Dodge Intrepid 4-door sedan). Vehicle 1's frontal plane struck the right side plane of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was in the southbound left turn lane intending to turn left and continue eastbound.
