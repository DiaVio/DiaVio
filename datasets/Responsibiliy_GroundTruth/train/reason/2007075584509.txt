The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 ran off the left side of the road, impacting a sign on the raised center median. This suggests poor directional control and possibly overcompensation by the driver. Additionally, the driver was inexperienced in driving this particular vehicle, which may have contributed to the loss of control. The wet road conditions due to rain could have also played a role in the driver's inability to maintain their travel lane.
