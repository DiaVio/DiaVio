The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the critical pre-crash event was V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the right side. This was caused by a vehicle-related factor, specifically the failure of the steering due to a broken mount on the power steering pump. The driver's fatigue, due to not having slept in over 17 hours, and his inattentiveness, as he was preoccupied with a personal problem and smoking a cigarette at the time of the crash, also contributed to the accident. Additionally, the lack of shoulders on the road was a contributing factor, as having more shoulder space may have allowed the driver to come to a safe stop before departing the road.
