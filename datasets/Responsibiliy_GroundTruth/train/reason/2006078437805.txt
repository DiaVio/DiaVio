The driver of V-1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the vehicle skidding for a significant distance before entering the asphalt roadway. Additionally, V-1 was overloaded with 18 passengers, which affected the stability of the vehicle due to the raised center of gravity. The fact that V-1 was driving with its lights off approaching the intersection also contributed to the crash.
