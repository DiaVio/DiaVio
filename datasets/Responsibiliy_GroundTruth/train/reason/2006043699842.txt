The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was making a left turn across the path of Vehicle 2, which had the right of way in the northbound lanes. Vehicle 1 failed to adequately surveil the roadway before making the turn, resulting in the collision. The driver of Vehicle 1 stated that she didn't have time to react and felt that a vehicle to her left may have obscured the vehicle she struck. However, it is the responsibility of the turning vehicle to ensure that it is safe to proceed before making the turn. On the other hand, Vehicle 2 was traveling within the speed limit and was unable to avoid the collision despite attempting to steer left in avoidance. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 for failing to yield the right of way and adequately surveil the roadway before making the left turn.
