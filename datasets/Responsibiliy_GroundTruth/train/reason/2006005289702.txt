The reason for this is that V2 was traveling east intending to continue straight through the intersection without slowing down. V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was traveling south and had already stopped at the stop sign. As a result, V2's left rear was struck by the front of V1, causing V2 to be forced off the roadway and subsequently collide with V3. V2's failure to yield the right of way and proceed through the intersection without slowing down is a clear violation of traffic rules and is the main contributing factor to the crash.
