The driver of V1 initiated a U-turn to change direction after receiving an emergency dispatch. However, the driver made a false assumption that traffic would yield the right of way. This false assumption, along with the driver's inattention due to talking on a CB, contributed to the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier) was not primarily responsible for the crash. The driver of V2 was not interviewed and refused to take part in the study. The only associated factor that could be coded to V2 was a false assumption regarding V1's movements. However, since V1's false assumption and inattention were the primary factors leading to the crash, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible.
