The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted and looking down at a pill package, which caused him to rear-end Vehicle #2 (2003 Nissan Pathfinder) that was stopped at a red light. Additionally, after the initial collision, the driver of Vehicle #1 backed up and struck Vehicle #2 a second time, indicating a lack of control and awareness. The driver's impaired state, having consumed sleeping pills and alcohol, likely contributed to his inability to react appropriately. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's distraction, impaired state, and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
