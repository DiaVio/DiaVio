The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost control of the vehicle on the wet surface, resulting in a counter-clockwise yaw and crossing the centerline into the eastbound lane. V1 then departed the left side of the road and collided with a tree and a shrub, causing significant damage to the vehicle. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle on the wet road surface indicates negligence on their part, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
