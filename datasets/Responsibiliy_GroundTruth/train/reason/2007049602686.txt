The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 stated that V2 (the Mack truck) was turning right and blocking all three lanes of the roadway. However, it is highly unlikely that the truck was turning right into a nearby alley of private housing. Additionally, the damage and final rest position of V1 suggest that the driver attempted to avoid the crash by applying brakes and steering to the right, indicating that there was not enough space for the truck to turn right from its position at the time of the impact. This suggests that V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not see V2 decelerating, resulting in the rear-end collision.
