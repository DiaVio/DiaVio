The reason for this is that V1 initiated a left turn in front of V2 (the Kia Sorento) without adequately surveilling the intersection. V1 failed to look or looked but did not see the oncoming vehicle, resulting in the collision. This is supported by the critical pre-crash event coded for V1, which indicates inadequate surveillance. While V2 may have encroached over the left lane line, it is important to note that V1's failure to yield the right of way and properly assess the oncoming traffic was the critical factor that led to the collision.
