The reason for this is that V1 swerved right to avoid a dead animal in the roadway, but lost control of the vehicle and entered the oncoming traffic, ultimately colliding with V2 (the Ford F150). V1's actions of swerving without taking any avoidance actions before striking V2 indicate a performance error and poor directional control, which led to the collision. While V2 was driving in their own lane and had no time to take any avoidance actions, the encroachment from V1 was a result of V1's loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
