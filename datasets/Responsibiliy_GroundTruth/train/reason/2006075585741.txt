The reason for V1's responsibility is poor directional control, as indicated by the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event being coded as a driver-related factor. V1's driver stated that a red car pulled out into her lane, but the non-contact vehicle, which was the witness, stated that they pulled out into the southbound lane to let other vehicles proceed with their turn. This suggests that V1's driver failed to maintain proper control of her vehicle and veered off the road, ultimately causing the accident.
