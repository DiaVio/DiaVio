The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. She could not see Vehicle two due to a van obscuring her view, and she assumed that there was no traffic in the southbound lanes except for the obscuring vehicle. This inadequate surveillance led to her turning left without properly ensuring that it was safe to do so, resulting in the collision with Vehicle two. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two (the 2004 Chevrolet Impala) was traveling in his designated lane and did not encroach on the opposite lane. Therefore, the critical reason for the accident was not attributed to him. In summary, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making a left turn.
