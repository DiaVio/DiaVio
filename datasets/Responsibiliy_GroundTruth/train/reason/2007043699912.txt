The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 turned left into the lane of V2 (the 2000 Chevrolet Venture minivan) without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event and critical reason assigned to V1, which states that V1 turned with an obstructed view and had inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V1's driver mentioned that a parked school bus driver waved him out into the roadway, but it is the responsibility of the driver turning left to ensure that it is safe to do so before proceeding. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and turning into the path of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
