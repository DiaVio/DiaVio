The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection and misjudged the gap or the speed of V1, resulting in the collision. V2 had a green left turn arrow, but it is the responsibility of the left-turning vehicle to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V2's misjudgment of the gap or speed of V1 led to the collision and makes V2 primarily responsible for the crash.
