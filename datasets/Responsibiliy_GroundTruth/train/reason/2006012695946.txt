The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver stated that she was approaching a stop sign and attempted to hit her brakes, but the brakes went to the floor. Instead of taking appropriate evasive action, such as using the emergency brake or steering away from the parked vehicle, the driver put the vehicle in park, causing the steering to lock up and resulting in the collision with V2 (1990 Buick Estate Wagon). This indicates a driver-related inadequate evasive action, which ultimately led to the loss of control and the accident.
