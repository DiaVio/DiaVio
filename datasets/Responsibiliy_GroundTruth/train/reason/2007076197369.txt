The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass V2 (the Hyundai Santa Fe) in a no passing zone for eastbound traffic. This action was a violation of traffic laws and contributed to the collision. Additionally, V1's false assumption of V2's actions, as indicated by the critical reason coded for V1, further demonstrates their responsibility for the accident.
