The driver of V1 admitted to being internally distracted, as she was engaged in a conversation with her son at the time of the accident. This distraction likely contributed to her inability to brake in time and avoid the collision with V2. Additionally, the driver mentioned that the wet road may have affected her brakes, but it is important to note that the responsibility for maintaining a safe distance and being able to stop in time lies with the driver. V2 (the Chevrolet Tahoe) was waiting at a red light and proceeded to make a left turn when the light turned green. V2 was struck from behind by V1, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's internal distraction and failure to brake in time, while V2 was following proper traffic rules and waiting for the appropriate time to make a left turn.
