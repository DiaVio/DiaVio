The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast for the conditions, which caused them to lose control of the vehicle. V1 crossed the centerline, skidded, and ultimately departed the roadway, resulting in the collision with the ditch/culvert and the steel gate. The driver's excessive speed and inability to maintain control of the vehicle indicate their primary responsibility for the accident.
