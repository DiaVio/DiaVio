The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the area before making the turn. The driver of V1 stated that they didn't see V2 until the impact, indicating a failure to properly observe their surroundings. Additionally, an associative factor of sunglare was coded for V1, suggesting that the driver may have been affected by the sun's glare and potentially impaired their visibility. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to observe the oncoming vehicle (V2) makes them primarily responsible for the collision.
