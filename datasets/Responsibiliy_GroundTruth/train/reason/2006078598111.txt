The reason for this is that V1 lost control and traveled into the oncoming traffic lane, resulting in a collision with V2 (the 2006 Kenworth tractor). The cause of V1's loss of control was a blowout and partial tread separation of the left front tire. This vehicle-related factor, specifically the failure of the tires/wheels, led to the critical pre-crash event for V1. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." However, the critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the crash.
