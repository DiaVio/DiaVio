The reason for this is that V2, the 1997 Ford Expedition, attempted to turn left onto the main roadway from the driveway without having a clear view of oncoming traffic. The driver stated that he had been stopped at the intersection for several seconds waiting for traffic to clear, but he did not see any vehicles and proceeded with the turn. This decision error, turning with an obstructed view, led to the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 was somewhat unfamiliar with the roadway, which may have contributed to his inability to accurately assess the traffic situation. The rain and wet road conditions were also associated factors that may have affected visibility and traction. On the other hand, V1, the 2002 Lexus LS430, was traveling in the appropriate lane and had the right of way. The driver of V1 reported that V2 turned left across in front of her, hesitating in the intersection. She applied the brakes but could not avoid the collision. Overall, V2's decision to turn left without a clear view of oncoming traffic and the associated factors of an obstructed view, unfamiliarity with the roadway, and adverse weather conditions make V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
