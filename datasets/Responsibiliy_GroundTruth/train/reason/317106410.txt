The reason for V1's responsibility is that it was traveling at a speed of 89 kph (55 mph) in a 64 kph (40 mph) speed limit zone. Additionally, V1 failed to negotiate the curve in the right lane and instead traveled onto the concrete island, ultimately colliding with a traffic light pole. This indicates a failure on the part of the driver to maintain control of the vehicle and adhere to the road conditions.
