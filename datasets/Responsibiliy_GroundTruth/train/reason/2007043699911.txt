The reason for this is inadequate surveillance, as indicated by the Critical Pre-crash Event for V2 being the vehicle turning left at the intersection and the Critical Reason being inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V2 failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic before making the left turn, resulting in the collision with V1 (the 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan).
