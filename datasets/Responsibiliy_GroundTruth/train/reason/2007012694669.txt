The driver of V1 made a left turn into the path of V2 (the 2007 GMC Acadia), failing to yield the right of way. This is evident from the witness statement, which mentions that V1 stopped to make a left turn, then proceeded to turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. V2 attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering to the right, but was unable to avoid contact with V1. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic and yield the right of way when making a left turn is the primary reason for the accident.
