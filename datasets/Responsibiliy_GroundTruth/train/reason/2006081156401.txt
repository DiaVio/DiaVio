The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to respond to the suddenly stopped forward traffic. The driver of V1 admitted to traveling at a speed of approximately 32-48 kmph (21-30 mph), which was too fast to avoid the collision when the traffic ahead came to a fast stop. This is supported by the pre-crash skid marks measured from V1, indicating that the driver was unable to stop in time. Additionally, V1 was following V2 with an estimated gap distance of 1.5 car lengths (estimated at 7.5 meters/25 feet), which may not have been a sufficient following distance to allow for a safe stopping distance. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to traveling too fast to respond to the sudden stop of the forward traffic.
