The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was unable to stop and went over the left lane double yellow line to pass the pick-up truck that was waiting to make a left turn. This action resulted in a collision with two guardrail posts and an embankment, causing damage to the vehicle. The driver of Vehicle #1 was distracted by talking on a cell phone, which was identified as an internal distraction. Additionally, the son of the driver mentioned that his mother usually drove a little too fast and had been involved in previous crashes within a year. Therefore, based on the driver's distraction, failure to stop, and previous driving behavior, Vehicle #1 (the Dodge Intrepid) is primarily responsible for the crash.
