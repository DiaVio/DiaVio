The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and had an obstructed view due to another vehicle waiting to turn left across her path. Despite not being able to see the approaching roadway clearly, V1 proceeded with her turn after waiting for a prolonged period of time. This indicates a failure to exercise caution and ensure that it was safe to make the turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Nissan 200SX) stated that he did not see V1 until he was near the crosswalk and that it appeared as though she was moving in slow motion. This suggests that V2 may have been driving at a higher speed and failed to anticipate the actions of V1. However, it is important to note that V2 also mentioned passing a large truck at the intersection waiting to turn left, which could have obstructed his view as well. This could be considered a contributing factor to the accident. Overall, V1's failure to exercise caution and proceed with a left turn despite having an obstructed view makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
