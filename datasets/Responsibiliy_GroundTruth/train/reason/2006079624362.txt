The reason for this is that V2, while exiting the private driveway and turning right to go northbound, made a wide turn and failed to adequately surveil the traffic before entering the roadway. V2 did not see V1 approaching in the number one lane and proceeded to collide with V1. V2's failure to stop before entering the traffic way and inadequate surveillance are key factors that contribute to their responsibility in the accident.
