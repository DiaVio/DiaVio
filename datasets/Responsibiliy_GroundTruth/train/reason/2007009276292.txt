The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive action by changing lanes without adequately surveilling the surrounding traffic. This resulted in V1 striking the rear of V2 (the 2003 Ford Explorer). Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she did not notice V2 until after she had changed lanes, indicating a lack of proper observation. It is important to note that the driver of V2 declined an interview and refused to allow his vehicle to be photographed, so no critical reason or associated factors could be determined for V2.
