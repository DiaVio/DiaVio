The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver, a 17-year-old high school student, was traveling at approximately 89kmph (the posted speed limit) and was unable to respond to the unexpected actions of the unknown vehicle that swerved in front of her. This indicates that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to react appropriately to the situation, resulting in poor directional control and ultimately causing the vehicle to collide with the concrete crossover divider. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as she had only driven the vehicle seven times before, may have contributed to her inability to handle the situation effectively. The tire deficiency, specifically the unknown tire blowing out after the impact, also played a role in the subsequent rollover of the vehicle.
