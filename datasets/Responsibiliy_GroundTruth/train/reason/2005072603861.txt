The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed higher than the posted speed limit, which may have contributed to the loss of control when the left rear tire blew out. Additionally, the under-inflated tires further decreased the driver's ability to maintain control on wet roads, increasing the probability of hydroplaning. The driver's fatigue may have also played a role in her failure to control the vehicle after the critical event. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and failure to maintain appropriate speed and tire conditions for the road conditions.
