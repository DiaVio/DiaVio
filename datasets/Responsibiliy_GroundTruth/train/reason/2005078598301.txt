The blow-out of the left front tire on the tractor caused a loss of control, resulting in V1 swerving into the #2 lane and contacting V2 (the Ford Explorer SUV). This indicates that V1's tire failure was a vehicle-related factor that directly led to the collision. V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the adjacent lane, but the critical reason was not attributed to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the tire blow-out and subsequent loss of control.
