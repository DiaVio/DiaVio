The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it was traveling southbound in the number-three lane and failed to see the disabled V2, which was stopped perpendicular to traffic in the same lane. V1's failure to notice V2 and subsequently striking it in a frontal (off-set left) impact indicates that V1 was not exercising proper caution and awareness while driving.
