The reason for this is that the driver of V1 suffered a seizure, which impaired their ability to act and control the vehicle. This physical impairment led to V1 drifting left and ultimately colliding with the concrete barrier. The driver's inability to recall anything in the previous two hours before the crash further supports the conclusion that their seizure was the primary cause of the accident.
