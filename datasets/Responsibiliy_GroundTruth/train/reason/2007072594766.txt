The reason for this is that V1 was attempting to pass the non-contact vehicle (NCV) while responding to a call with emergency lights and sirens activated. However, when the NCV abruptly returned to the roadway, the driver of V1 steered to the left and traveled off the left side of the roadway. This incorrect evasive action by the driver of V1 ultimately led to the vehicle striking a utility pole and rolling over. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factor of incorrect evasive action.
