The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver veered left and impacted the concrete traffic barrier with the front plane of the vehicle. The driver's claim that she was impacted on the right front panel by another vehicle is not supported by physical evidence. Additionally, the driver's statement that she veered away from a non-contact vehicle is contradicted by the critical pre-crash event coding, which indicates that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation and failure to maintain control of the vehicle while negotiating the leftward curvature of the road.
