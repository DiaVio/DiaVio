The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 overcompensated while trying to avoid a non-contact vehicle that encroached into V1's travel lane. This overcompensation caused V1 to steer towards the south edge of the on-ramp, resulting in the collision with the raised asphalt curb and subsequent rollover down the dirt embankment. Additionally, the police reported travel speed for V1 was 72 kmph, which indicates that V1 was likely traveling at a speed higher than the designated speed limit of 104 kmph (65 mph) for the on-ramp. This excessive speed may have contributed to the driver's poor directional control and inability to safely navigate the curve on the wet on-ramp. Overall, V1's driver's overcompensation and poor directional control, combined with potentially excessive speed, led to the collision and subsequent rollover.
