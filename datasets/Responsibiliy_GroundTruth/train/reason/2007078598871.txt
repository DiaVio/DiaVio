The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking both right and left, the driver of V1 did not see V2 approaching in the number three lane of eastbound traffic. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic resulted in V1 pulling out and colliding with V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to see the approaching vehicle led to the accident, making them primarily responsible.
