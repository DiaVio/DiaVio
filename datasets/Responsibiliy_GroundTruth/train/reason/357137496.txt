The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle lost control and the vehicle entered a counterclockwise rotation, ultimately resulting in it departing the roadway and colliding with a tree. The driver's lack of control and inability to maintain the vehicle's trajectory on the snowy/slushy road suggests that the case vehicle was not being operated safely or within the limits of the road conditions. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not restrained by a three-point belt further indicates a lack of adherence to safety measures, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of the injuries sustained. Therefore, the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of the case vehicle and their failure to maintain control and operate the vehicle safely in adverse weather conditions.
