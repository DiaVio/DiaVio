The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was unable to avoid impacting the back of Vehicle 2 (the garbage truck) despite being in the outboard travel lane and having clear visibility. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 1 failed to maintain a safe distance or react in time to the stopped traffic ahead, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the fact that Vehicle 1 sustained moderate frontal damage indicates that it was the striking vehicle in this scenario.
