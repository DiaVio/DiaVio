The driver of V1 approached V2 at a higher rate of speed and failed to maintain a safe distance, resulting in a collision with the back of the boat being towed by V2. This initial impact caused the boat to fall off the trailer and obstruct the roadway. Additionally, V1 then veered off the roadway, collided with a mailbox post, and ultimately rolled over multiple times before coming to a rest. These actions indicate a lack of control and failure to maintain proper lane position by the driver of V1. Therefore, based on the sequence of events and the driver's actions, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
