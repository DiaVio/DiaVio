The reason for this is that V1 was speeding and weaving between lanes, and failed to stop for the traffic control device (traffic light). V1's decision error and aggressive driving behavior, along with traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, led to the collision with V2. Additionally, V1 fled the scene, further indicating their responsibility for the accident.
