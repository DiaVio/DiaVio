The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 crossed over into the eastbound travel lane while traveling westbound in a right turning curve, resulting in a head-on collision with Vehicle 2 (2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee) in its travel lane. This indicates that Vehicle 1 was in the wrong lane and failed to maintain its lane, causing the collision.
