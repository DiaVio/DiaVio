The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it lost control due to the poor road conditions (icy roads). V1 hit a patch of ice while negotiating a left-hand curve, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and cross over the lane line to the left. As a result, V1 went off the left side of the road and impacted V2 (the parked 1985 Oldsmobile Delta 88). Although the ice accumulation on the road was caused by poor drainage, which is an environmental factor, V1's inability to maintain control and stay within its lane ultimately led to the collision.
