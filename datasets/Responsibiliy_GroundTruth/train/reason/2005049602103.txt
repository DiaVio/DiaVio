The police report cited a failure to yield the right-of-way as a contributing factor for V1. V1 attempted to make a left turn to enter an apartment complex, crossing the path of V2 (the driver of the 1991 Mazda MPV) who was traveling straight in the second lane. V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2, resulting in the collision. Additionally, there were no indicators from the scene or vehicle inspection that suggest any other factors contributed to the accident, other than the wet roadway.
