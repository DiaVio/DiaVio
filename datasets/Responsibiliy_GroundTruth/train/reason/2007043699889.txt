The reason for V1's primary responsibility is the driver's physical impairment, specifically the reported heart attack or other physical impairment of the ability to act. The driver stated that he blacked out and could not remember specifics of the crash. The medical report also mentioned a history of renal cancer and hypertension, which could have contributed to the driver's physical impairment. Additionally, the investigating officer estimated V1's travel speed to be 96 kmph (60 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 88 kmph (55 mph). This indicates that V1 was traveling at an excessive speed, which could have further contributed to the driver's inability to control the vehicle. Overall, the combination of the driver's physical impairment and the excessive speed suggests that V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
