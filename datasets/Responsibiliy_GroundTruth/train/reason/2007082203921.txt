The reason for V1's responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 failed to notice V2 (the Honda Accord) approaching from the south before entering the intersection. It is unclear if V1 came to a full stop before proceeding into the intersection, indicating a lack of attention and awareness of the surrounding traffic.
