The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was under the influence of narcotics, as evidenced by the presence of multiple prescription bottles, some of which were empty, and the driver's subsequent arrest for driving under the influence. Additionally, V1 driver failed to stop for a traffic control device, in this case, a red light, and chose to pass the vehicles in front of him, entering the intersection illegally. These driver-related factors clearly indicate that V1 driver was engaging in illegal and unsafe maneuvers, leading to the collision.
