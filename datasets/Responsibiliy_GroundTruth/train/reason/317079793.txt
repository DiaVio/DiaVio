The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed and veered off the road, ultimately causing multiple collisions with guardrails, a chain link fence, and a concrete barrier wall. The driver of V1 also sustained injuries in the crash, indicating that they were likely the one at fault for the incident.
