The reason for this is that V1 made a right turn onto the intersecting roadway and crossed the path of V2, the 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe 4x4. V2 was northbound in the curb-turn lane of a divided four-lane trafficway, and V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. This resulted in the front of V2 striking the left side of V1, causing the accident.
