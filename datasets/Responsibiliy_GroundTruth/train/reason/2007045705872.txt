The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she left the road to turn around on her front yard, then re-entered the road in the wrong lane (northbound lane instead of southbound). This action resulted in a head-on collision with V2 (the driver of the Dodge Neon) who was traveling north in the correct lane. V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic in the northbound lane contributed to the crash. Additionally, V1's admission of being in a hurry and running late may have caused her to be inattentive and not fully focused on the road. While V2 was traveling slightly above the posted speed limit, their speed alone does not absolve V1 of responsibility as V2 had the right of way and was driving in the correct lane. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her improper lane usage, inadequate surveillance, and potential inattentiveness.
