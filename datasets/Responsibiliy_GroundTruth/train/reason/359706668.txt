The reason for this is that the driver of V2 suffered a medical episode, crossed the center lane lines, and traveled into the eastbound lane, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2001 Volkswagen Eurovan. This indicates that the driver of V2 was unable to maintain control of their vehicle due to a medical condition, leading to the accident.
