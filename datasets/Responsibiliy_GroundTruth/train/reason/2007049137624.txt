The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver lost directional control of the vehicle, resulting in the vehicle rotating clockwise and ultimately colliding with the guardrail. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating that V1 veered off the road, leading to the loss of control. The critical reason for this event was coded as "poor directional control," suggesting that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Since the driver of V1 was unable to be located and interviewed, it is not possible to determine any additional factors that may have contributed to the loss of control. However, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
