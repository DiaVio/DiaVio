The reason for this is that V2 was making a left turn across the northbound lane to enter a parking lot, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1, the 2010 Hyundai Elantra, was traveling north on the roadway and had the right of way. V2 failed to yield to V1, resulting in the sideswipe collision between the two vehicles.
