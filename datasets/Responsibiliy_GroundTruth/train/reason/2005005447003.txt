The reason for this is that V1 lost control of the vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions. The driver stated that she hit an ice patch on the right side of the road, hit some bushes, and then lost control of the vehicle, ultimately going off the roadway to the left. The police reported travel speed for V1 was 56 kmph, which is above the posted school speed limit of 24 kph (15mph). Additionally, the driver estimated her speed to be under 40 kph (25mph), which still exceeds the posted speed limit. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions and failing to maintain control of the vehicle.
