The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 overcompensated when the non-contact vehicle merged back into V1's lane. Instead of maintaining control and avoiding contact with the median wall, V1 steered left and ultimately collided with the wall. This overcompensation can be considered a performance error on the part of V1's driver. Additionally, the associative factors of false assumption of the other driver's actions and insufficient steering and braking actions contribute to V1's responsibility for the accident. The driver of V1 assumed that the non-contact vehicle would continue merging onto the off-ramp, but when the other vehicle changed its mind and steered left, V1's driver failed to react appropriately and avoid the collision. Overall, V1's driver's overcompensation, false assumption, and insufficient steering and braking actions led to the accident, making V1 primarily responsible.
