The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the intersection and crossed the path of Vehicle 1, resulting in the impact between the front left area of Vehicle 1 and the right front side surface of Vehicle 2. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, leading to the collision.
