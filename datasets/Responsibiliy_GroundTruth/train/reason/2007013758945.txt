The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead. The driver admitted to looking out the right side of the vehicle at potential deer hunting locations, which indicates a lack of focus on the roadway. When the driver looked forward again, they suddenly encountered two deer standing in the road. Instead of taking adequate evasive action, such as braking or swerving to avoid the deer, the driver steered to the right and ultimately went off the roadway, resulting in a collision with a tree. Therefore, V1's inadequate evasive action and failure to maintain control of the vehicle due to distraction make them primarily responsible for the crash.
