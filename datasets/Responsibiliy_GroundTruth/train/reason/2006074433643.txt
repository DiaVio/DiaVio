The driver of V1 was internally distracted while adjusting the radio, which caused him to not notice the disabled V2 (the Red 1932 Ford Model B 2-door coupe) in the roadway. As a result, V1 collided into the rear of V2, causing both vehicles to catch fire. Additionally, the driver of V2 was struck by his own vehicle at impact.
