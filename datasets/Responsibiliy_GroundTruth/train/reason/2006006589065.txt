The driver of Vehicle one admitted to being distracted by trying to get someone's attention outside of her vehicle, which caused her to not notice that the traffic had come to a complete stop. This distraction led to her failure to react in time and resulted in her vehicle colliding with the rear of Vehicle two (2003 Mitsubishi Galant). This initial impact then caused Vehicle two to collide with the rear of Vehicle three (1994 Ford Crown Victoria). Reason: Vehicle one's driver was distracted by an external factor, leading to a recognition error and failure to notice the stopped traffic ahead.
