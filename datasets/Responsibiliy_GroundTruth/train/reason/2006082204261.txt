The driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 when pulling out into the intersection. This was due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and confusion, as well as the odor of alcohol on his breath. Additionally, the driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the area and did not observe V2 approaching on the arterial road.
