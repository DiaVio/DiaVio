The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it attempted to make a left turn at the intersection, which resulted in the front of Vehicle two (V2), the 2003 Honda Accord sedan, contacting the right side of V1. Making a left turn requires yielding to oncoming traffic, and it appears that V1 failed to do so, causing the collision.
