The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was fleeing from the police in an attempt to avoid being caught for driving without a license. This decision to flee from the police led to the driver losing control of the vehicle after its tires were damaged by the stop sticks. The driver's decision to engage in illegal and aggressive driving, as well as traveling too fast for the conditions, ultimately resulted in the crash.
