The reason for this is that the POV (V2) was stopped in the grass area, waiting to make a U-turn across the trafficway. When the POV (V2) pulled out to make the U-turn, it failed to yield the right of way to the oncoming case vehicle (V1). The driver of the case vehicle (V1) attempted to avoid the impact by applying the brakes and steering to the left, but was unable to avoid colliding with the POV (V2). Therefore, the POV (V2) is primarily responsible for the crash as it failed to yield the right of way.
