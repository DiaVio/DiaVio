The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection and collided with the right side of V2. The driver of V1 admitted to not paying attention to the roadway and being "zoned-out" at the time of the accident. Additionally, the Critical Reason for the Critical Event for V1 was coded as inattention and failed to stop for a traffic control device. On the other hand, the driver of V2 was driving within the speed limit and did not contribute to the critical event. The Critical Reason for the Critical Event was not coded to V2. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to stop at the stop sign and their inattention to the roadway.
