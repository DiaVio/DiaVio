The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 suddenly veered to the left and into the left northbound lane without any apparent reason. This sudden maneuver caused V1 to collide with the front of Vehicle two (V2), which was traveling in the left northbound lane and unable to avoid the collision.
