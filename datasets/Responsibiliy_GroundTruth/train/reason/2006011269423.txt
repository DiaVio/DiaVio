The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 113kmph (70 mph), which was too fast for the wet road conditions. - V1 attempted to pass V2 by moving into lane two, but failed to account for the standing water in that lane. - V1 hydroplaned and lost control of the vehicle, causing it to rotate counterclockwise and collide with the left back of V2. - The driver of V1 admitted to overcompensating with steering, indicating a performance error. - The driver of V1 had limited driving experience, having only been driving for 4 months and having driven the vehicle on only one previous occasion. - The driver of V1 was unfamiliar with the roadway and did not exercise caution despite the dangerous conditions. - Other drivers traveling at lower speeds did not have difficulty with the standing water, suggesting that V1's speed was a contributing factor. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to traveling too fast for the conditions, poor decision-making, inexperience, and unfamiliarity with the roadway.
