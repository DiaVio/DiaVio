The driver of V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, which was reported to be 80-90 mph, on a snow-covered roadway. This indicates that the driver was not adjusting their speed to the road conditions, which is a critical reason for the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted to not having taken driver's training and being unfamiliar with both the roadway and the vehicle, as it was his first time driving it. These factors contribute to the driver's inexperience and lack of knowledge in handling the vehicle properly in adverse conditions. Furthermore, the driver's conversation with the passenger may have distracted him from focusing on the road and adapting to the snowy conditions. The fact that the driver tested positive for THC, a psychoactive component of marijuana, suggests that the driver may have been impaired, which could have affected his ability to safely operate the vehicle. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, inexperience, unfamiliarity with the roadway and vehicle, failure to adjust to the snow-covered conditions, and potential impairment from drug use.
