The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling westbound and drifted across the double yellow center lane line, entering the eastbound travel lane. - V1's left side struck the left side of V2 (the 1998 Ford F150 pickup) as they passed each other. - V1's actions of crossing into the opposite lane of travel caused the collision. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that V1 was not maintaining their lane properly. - The critical reason for V1 was coded as a driver-related factor, specifically driving too fast for the curve. - The investigating officer estimated V1's travel speed to be 88 kmph (55 mph), which was above the posted speed limit of 72 kmph (45 mph). - Additionally, V1 was under the influence of alcohol and had medical conditions (diabetes and pancreatitis) that may have adversely affected their ability to drive safely. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain their lane, driving too fast for the curve, and potential impairment from alcohol and medical conditions.
