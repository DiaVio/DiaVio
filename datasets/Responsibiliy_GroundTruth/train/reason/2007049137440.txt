The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was distracted by a phone conversation and failed to notice her exit. As a result, she attempted to exit at the last moment, crossed over the painted paved gore area, and struck an impact attenuator. Subsequently, V1 entered lane two where it collided with V2 (the 1998 Jeep Wrangler). V1's distraction and failure to properly navigate the exit contributed to the chain of events leading to the crash.
