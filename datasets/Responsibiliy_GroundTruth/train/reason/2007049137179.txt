The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was found to be inattentive, which was the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event. The driver had erratic sleep patterns due to his family situation and had been at the hospital the entire day prior to the crash. Additionally, the driver stated that he had been following V2 for some distance and did not know the gap distance between his vehicle and V2. Despite attempting to brake, the driver was unable to avoid the collision. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the rear-end crash.
