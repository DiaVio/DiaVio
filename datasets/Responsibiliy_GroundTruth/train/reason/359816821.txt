The reason for this is that V1 drifted to the left, crossed over into the eastbound lane, and ultimately departed the roadway into a sloped ditch. V1 then continued to travel in the ditch, swiping a tree/shrub on the left side, before impacting a large tree in a wooded area. This indicates that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to maintain proper lane position, resulting in the accident. Additionally, the fact that the driver sustained serious injuries suggests that she may have been driving at an excessive speed or was otherwise not exercising proper caution while operating the vehicle. The presence of minor injuries to the other occupants, who were not properly restrained, further highlights the driver's responsibility for the accident. Overall, the actions and behavior of the driver of V1 indicate that she is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
