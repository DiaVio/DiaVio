The reason for this is that V1, driven by a 69-year-old male who failed a field sobriety test and was suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol, was observed drifting over the centerline into the lane of travel of V2. The investigating officer stated that the driver's poor directional control, possibly influenced by alcohol, was the critical reason for the pre-crash event. On the other hand, V2, driven by a 36-year-old male in good health and wearing prescription lenses, stated that he saw V1 crossing the centerline and braked but could not avoid the collision. V2 was not thought to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, V1's impaired driving and poor directional control make them primarily responsible for the accident.
