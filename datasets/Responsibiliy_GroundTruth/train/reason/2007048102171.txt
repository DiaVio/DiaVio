The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which is a higher-risk maneuver compared to proceeding straight through the intersection. V2 (the driver of the 2005 Chevrolet Silverado K1500 pickup) was traveling straight in their lane and had the right of way. V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision between V1 and V2. Additionally, V1's speed at the time of the crash was reported to be 16 kmph (10 mph), which indicates that V1 may not have been traveling at an appropriate speed for making a left turn safely. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and potentially inadequate speed for the turn make them primarily responsible for the accident.
