The reason for this is that V1 entered the intersection without the right of way, failing to yield to V2 which was already traveling in the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 was found to have inadequate surveillance, as they did not completely stop for the stop sign and failed to see the oncoming V2. The witness statement also suggests that the driver of V1 may have momentarily fallen asleep, further contributing to their failure to properly observe the intersection.
