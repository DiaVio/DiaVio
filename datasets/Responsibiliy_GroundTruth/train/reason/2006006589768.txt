The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. The driver of V1 admitted to being unsure if she had stopped at the stop sign and mentioned that her view of any vehicles traveling westbound was obstructed by parked trucks. Additionally, V1 was traveling at a higher speed of approximately 56 kmph (35 mph), which indicates a failure to exercise caution and control while approaching the intersection. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2006 Dodge Charger) was traveling within the speed limit and had the right of way since there was no stop sign for his direction of travel. V2 was simply proceeding through the intersection as expected. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the stop sign, combined with the higher speed and obstructed view, makes V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
