The driver of V1 admitted to taking his eyes off the road for ten seconds, resulting in him sideswiping V2 and V3. This indicates a recognition error, as the driver failed to recognize the presence of the other vehicles and maintain control of his own vehicle. The distraction, whether internal or external, led to the driver's inattention and ultimately caused the collision.
