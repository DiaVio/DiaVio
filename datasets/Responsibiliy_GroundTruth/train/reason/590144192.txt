The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to use the seat belt restraint during the crash, which could have potentially mitigated the severity of her injuries. Additionally, the driver of V1 entered the left turn lane without having a clear view of the oncoming Vehicle 2 (V2) due to the presence of a large RV making a left turn. This lack of visibility and failure to yield to oncoming traffic resulted in V1 driving into the path of V2, leading to the collision.
