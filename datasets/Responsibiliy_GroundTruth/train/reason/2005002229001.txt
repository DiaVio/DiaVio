The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 pulled to the right side of the roadway into a driveway entrance and then entered the roadway to the left, attempting to cross over into a driveway on the west side of the roadway. This action put Vehicle #2 directly in the path of Vehicle #1 (the Ford Escort), which was traveling behind Vehicle #2. Although Vehicle #1 took evasive maneuvers by braking and steering left, it was unable to avoid colliding with Vehicle #2. Therefore, Vehicle #2's improper maneuver of crossing the roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic is the main reason for the crash.
