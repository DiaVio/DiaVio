The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. He admitted to not seeing V2 (the 33-year-old female driver of the Saturn) when he pulled out to turn left. Additionally, V1 had only been driving for 2 months and had not taken driver training, indicating a lack of experience and knowledge of proper driving techniques. While there were contributing factors such as the rainy and windy weather conditions, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic is the main cause of the accident.
