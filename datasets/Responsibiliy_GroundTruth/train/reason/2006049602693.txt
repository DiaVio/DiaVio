The driver of Vehicle One made a left turn at the intersection, and according to the driver's statement, the protected arrow had expired at the time of the turn. Additionally, the driver was distracted by dialing his cell phone and in a hurry to get home. These factors indicate that the driver of Vehicle One made an error in judgment and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Although the driver of Vehicle Two was not interviewed and there is no known pre-crash information for this driver, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from opposite direction- over left lane line." This suggests that Vehicle Two was in its designated lane and did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's decision error, distraction, and failure to yield the right of way.
