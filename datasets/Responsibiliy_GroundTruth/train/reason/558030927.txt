The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was making a left turn across the path of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1986 Ford E-250 van. V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, resulting in the front of V2 striking the right side of V1. This indicates that V1 violated the right of way and caused the collision.
