The driver of V1 made a recognition error and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic before making a left turn at the intersection. This was further compounded by the fact that the driver's view was obstructed by another vehicle, preventing her from seeing the oncoming V2. Therefore, V1's failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
