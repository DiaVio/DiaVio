The reason for this is that V2 attempted to change lanes into lane one while negotiating a curve, resulting in a corner side-swipe impact with Vehicle Three (V3). This initial impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and cross over into the opposite lanes of travel. The subsequent impact with Vehicle One (V1) was a result of V2's initial lane change maneuver. Therefore, V2's actions of changing lanes during a curve led to the chain of events that caused the accident.
