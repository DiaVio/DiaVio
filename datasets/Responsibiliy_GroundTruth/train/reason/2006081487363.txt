The reason for assigning primary responsibility to V1 is that they failed to recognize that the forward vehicles were stopped in the southbound traffic lanes. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver, leading to the collision with the rear of V2 (the 2004 GMC Yukon SUV). Additionally, the damage to both vehicles suggests that the driver of V1 did not attempt to steer left or right to avoid the impact and stayed in their original pre-crash travel lane. This further indicates a lack of evasive action taken by V1. While the case summary does not provide enough information to determine the exact critical reason for V1's failure to recognize the stopped traffic, it is clear that their actions were a contributing factor to the accident.
