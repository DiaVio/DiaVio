The witness stated that V2 went through a steady red light at the intersection and was speeding. This indicates that V2 failed to obey the traffic signal and was driving recklessly. Additionally, V2's driver admitted to being distracted by her slippers slipping off her foot, which further supports the conclusion that V2 was not paying proper attention to the road. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at a red light, speeding, and distracted driving make them primarily responsible for the accident.
