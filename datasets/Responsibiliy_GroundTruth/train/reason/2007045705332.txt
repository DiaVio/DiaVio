The reason for this is that V1 attempted a left turn on a solid green light, misjudging the gap distance and speed of V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Blazer) who was traveling straight through the intersection. V1's misjudgment resulted in the front of V1 striking the left side of V2. Additionally, several associated factors contribute to V1's responsibility, including fatigue from a long drive, exterior distractions caused by focusing on a non-contact vehicle and the intended turn destination, being in a hurry, unfamiliarity with the vehicle and roadway, and headlight glare. On the other hand, V2 had a solid green light and assumed that V1 would wait for him to clear before proceeding, which was a false assumption. However, this false assumption does not contribute significantly to V2's responsibility for the accident.
