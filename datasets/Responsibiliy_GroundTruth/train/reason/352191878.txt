The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 experienced a loss of control and departed the roadway, ultimately rolling over and causing damage to a street light lamp pole and a small tree/shrub. The driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a left steering maneuver just prior to entering the adjacent paved shoulder area, which led to the vehicle traveling sideways and eventually rolling over.
