The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason, resulting in multiple collisions with the median wall and the tri-beam guardrail. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and the subsequent collisions indicate that V1 was the main contributing factor to the accident.
