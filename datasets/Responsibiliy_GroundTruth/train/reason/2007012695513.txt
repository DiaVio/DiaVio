The reason for this is that V1 initiated the left turn without having a clear view of V2 (the Chevrolet Blazer utility vehicle) due to the bus obstructing their view. V1 stated that they did not see V2 and did not attempt any avoidance actions. This indicates that V1 failed to exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. While V2 was traveling at a relatively high speed, they saw V1 just prior to impact and applied the brakes, indicating that they made an effort to avoid the collision. Additionally, V2's critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as "Other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, turning into opposite direction," which suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way and their decision to turn with an obstructed view.
