The reason for this is that V2 departed its lane, crossed the center lane lines, and sideswiped the left side of Vehicle 3 (V3). V2 then continued and impacted the front of Vehicle 1 (V1), resulting in serious injuries to both occupants of V1. This indicates that V2's actions directly caused the collision with V1 and the resulting injuries.
