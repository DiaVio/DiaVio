The driver of V1 stated that the van drifted to the right onto the soft dirt shoulder, possibly due to a wind gust. However, the driver's poor directional control and failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected is the critical reason for the crash. The driver's inexperience, as he had only been driving for one year and for only two months with a full-size van, is also a contributing factor. Additionally, the ambient conditions, including sporadic wind gusts, may have played a role in the crash. The inefficient braking and steering inputs by the driver further contributed to the accident. The moderate condition of the transmission and low tread on the right side tires associated with V1 also played a role. Overall, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's poor directional control and inexperience, as well as the contributing factors of ambient conditions and inefficient braking and steering inputs.
