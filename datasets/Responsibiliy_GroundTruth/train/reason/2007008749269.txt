The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made an incorrect evasive action by riding over the curb on the right side of the roadway and then returning to the original travel lane. This action caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2 (the 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee), which was stopped in traffic. V1's driver claimed that her accelerator stuck and her brakes failed to slow her down, but upon inspection, it was found that the car was not well-maintained, with worn tires and possibly worn brakes. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 did not take proper care of the vehicle, which contributed to the accident.
