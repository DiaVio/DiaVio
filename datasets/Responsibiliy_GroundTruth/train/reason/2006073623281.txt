The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 drifted into lane one where the impact occurred. The critical reason was coded as "poor directional control," suggesting that V1 failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that she didn't know what happened and mentioned that she slid on the wet roads. She also mentioned that the brakes felt funny since it was raining. Although there was no evidence of hydroplaning, the fact that the driver mentioned sliding on wet roads and the lower tire inflation pressure could indicate that V1's tires were not properly maintained, contributing to the loss of control. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to poor directional control and failure to maintain control of the vehicle while changing lanes.
