The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a high rate of speed, estimated to be around 113kmph (70mph), which was too fast for the conditions of the road. Additionally, witnesses stated that V1 and a motorcycle appeared to be racing, indicating aggressive driving behavior. V1's decision to follow the motorcycle closely and engage in racing activities contributed to the critical event of V1 going off the edge of the road on the right side. Furthermore, it is important to note that the driver of V1 had been drinking alcohol prior to the crash, and it is believed that he would have been over the legal limit if a blood alcohol test had been administered. While the police did not charge the driver with any violations, the presence of alcohol in his system further supports the conclusion that V1's actions and decisions were responsible for the crash.
