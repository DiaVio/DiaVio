The driver of Vehicle 1 failed to observe the traffic congestion ahead and subsequently rear-ended Vehicle 2, which was stopped in the same travel lane. This initial impact caused severe damage to Vehicle 1 and set off a chain of events that led to further collisions with Vehicle 3 and ultimately resulted in Vehicle 1 coming to rest in a drainage canal.
