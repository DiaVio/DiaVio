The driver's girlfriend stated that the driver was driving recklessly and had been drinking. This indicates that the driver was impaired and not in a suitable condition to operate a vehicle safely. Additionally, the male occupant who was in the vehicle before the crash confirmed that the driver was driving recklessly down the roadway. The fact that the driver refused to let another person drive the car and continued to drive recklessly suggests a disregard for the safety of himself and others on the road. Furthermore, the presence of tire marks in the soft shoulder indicates that the driver did not attempt any avoidance maneuvers, suggesting a lack of control over the vehicle. Overall, the driver's reckless behavior, impairment from alcohol, and failure to take appropriate actions to avoid the crash make V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
