The driver of Vehicle #1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding across it. She stopped in the median crossover and waited for two non-contact southbound vehicles to turn left into the crossover. After they passed, she proceeded across the intersection without looking right again to check for oncoming vehicles. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to the collision with Vehicle #2 (the Nissan Altima). While Vehicle #2 made a false assumption that the other vehicle would yield right of way, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle #1 for not properly ensuring it was safe to proceed across the intersection.
