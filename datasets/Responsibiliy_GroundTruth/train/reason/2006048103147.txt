The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced tread separation on the right side of the vehicle, causing some trailer swing. Instead of safely maintaining control of the vehicle, the driver attempted to change lanes to the left, resulting in the left side of the tractor striking V2 (the 2005 Jeep Liberty) on its right side. This indicates a failure on the part of V1's driver to properly handle the situation and maintain control of the vehicle, leading to the collision with V2.
