The driver of V1 was driving at a speed of 113 kph (70 mph) on a wet road with standing water, which is above the speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph). Additionally, the driver was aware of concerns about driving the vehicle in the rain and was distracted by conversing with the occupant. These factors indicate that the driver was not exercising caution and did not adjust their driving behavior to the road conditions. Furthermore, the low tread depth of the rear tires on V1 may have contributed to the loss of control of the vehicle. This suggests that the driver did not properly maintain the vehicle, which is another factor contributing to their responsibility for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driving too fast for the wet road conditions, being distracted, and not properly maintaining the vehicle.
