The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by his dogs in the back seat, which caused him to turn around and lose sight of the traffic in front of him. As a result, V1 failed to notice that the vehicles ahead had stopped, leading to the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," indicating that V1 failed to react to the stopped vehicles in front of him. The critical reason for this event was identified as a driver-related factor, specifically an internal distraction caused by the driver's dogs. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's distraction and failure to maintain proper attention to the road ahead.
