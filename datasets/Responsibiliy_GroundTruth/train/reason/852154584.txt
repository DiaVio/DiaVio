The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was traveling off the left side of the roadway while negotiating a curve to the right. This indicates that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and veered off the road, ultimately resulting in the collision with the trees. Additionally, the fact that the driver was not belted and did not have the frontal impact airbag deployed suggests a lack of proper safety precautions, which contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained.
