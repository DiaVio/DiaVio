The reason for this is that V1 drifted into the parking lane and collided with the back of V2's trailer. This indicates that V1 was not maintaining proper control of their vehicle and failed to stay within their lane. Additionally, V1 left the scene without providing any information, which is a violation of the law and shows a lack of responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their driver-related error of drifting into the parking lane and leaving the scene of the accident.
