The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 departed the right side of the roadway, contacting the curb with its right side wheels and then its left side wheels, before ultimately striking a tree with its frontal plane. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle 1 lost control of the vehicle and failed to negotiate the left turning curve, resulting in the collision with the tree.
