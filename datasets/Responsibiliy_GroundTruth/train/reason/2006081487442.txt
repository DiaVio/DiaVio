The reason for this is that V1 was under the influence of cocaine, methamphetamines, and opiates, as confirmed by the toxicology report. The driver's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) reading was also significantly high, indicating intoxication. These substances impaired the driver's ability to control the speed of the vehicle and stay within their travel lane while negotiating the curve. The event data recorder reading for V1 also showed a speed change consistent with losing control of the vehicle. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2000 GMC Sonoma Pickup) was reportedly in good health, well-rested, and not in a hurry. The event data recorder reading for V2 indicated that the driver was traveling at a reasonable speed and attempted to steer and brake to avoid the collision. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's impaired state and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
