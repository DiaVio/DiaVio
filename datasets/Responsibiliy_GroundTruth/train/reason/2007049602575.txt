The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. The driver admitted to not seeing V2 until it appeared right in front of him, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. Additionally, a witness stated that V1 accelerated in an attempt to pass through the intersection before the signal turned red, suggesting a disregard for traffic laws and safety. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla) was traveling at a normal rate of speed and did not see V1 until the collision occurred. There is no indication of any fault or contributing factors on the part of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and potentially reckless driving behavior.
