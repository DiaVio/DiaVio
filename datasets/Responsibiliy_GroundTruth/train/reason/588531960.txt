The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was struck on its left side by the frontal plane of Vehicle 2, indicating that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time, suggesting that Vehicle 1 did not properly assess the oncoming traffic before proceeding. Additionally, the fact that Vehicle 1's driver was unbelted may have contributed to the severity of the injuries sustained in the crash.
