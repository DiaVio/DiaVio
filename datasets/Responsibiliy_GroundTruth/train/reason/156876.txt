The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the northbound through-lane with its lights and sirens running, indicating that it was an emergency vehicle responding to a call. However, V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. V2 moved into the left-turn lane to avoid traffic and proceeded into the intersection, resulting in the collision with V1.
