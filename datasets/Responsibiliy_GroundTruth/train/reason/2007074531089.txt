The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that initially lost control and crossed over into the opposing traffic lanes. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling; off the edge of the road on the left side," indicating that V1 veered out of its lane and onto the median. The critical reason for this event was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control," suggesting that the driver of V1 failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Econoline van) was not primarily responsible for the accident. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line," indicating that V2 was encroached upon by V1 crossing into its lane. The critical reason for this event was not coded to V2, suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's poor directional control, while V2 is not at fault as they were encroached upon by V1 crossing into their lane.
