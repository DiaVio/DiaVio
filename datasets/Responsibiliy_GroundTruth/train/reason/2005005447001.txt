The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 experienced a recognition error due to an interior distraction caused by the front seat passenger playing with a balloon. This distraction led to V1 traveling off the roadway to the right side, ultimately resulting in the crash. The driver's estimation of her speed being 50mph also suggests that she may have been driving above the posted speed limit of 45mph, which further contributes to V1's responsibility.
