The reason for this is that the driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver stated that he had been driving with his arm above his eyes to block the sun glare, which likely impaired his visibility. This inadequate surveillance led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 2001 Ford Windstar van) was not primarily responsible for the accident. Although V2 was involved in an encroachment event, where another vehicle crossed its path, this critical reason was not coded to V2. Therefore, it can be inferred that V2 was not at fault for the accident.
