The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One was not licensed to drive, which is a clear violation of the law. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "driver related factor: illegal maneuver," indicating that the driver of Vehicle One made an illegal maneuver by entering the intersection when it was not safe to do so. While the driver of Vehicle Two (1994 Buick Skylark) stated that she never saw the other vehicle coming, it is important to note that Vehicle Two had the right of way as it was traveling straight through the intersection. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street across path," suggesting that Vehicle One encroached into the path of Vehicle Two. Therefore, based on the driver's illegal maneuver and the violation of not having a valid driver's license, Vehicle One (1988 Buick Le Sabre) is primarily responsible for the accident.
