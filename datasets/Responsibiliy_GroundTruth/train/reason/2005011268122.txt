The reason for this is that V1 cut the corner too sharply while making a left turn, crossing into the lane occupied by V2 (the driver of the 2002 Ford Ranger). V2, being experienced with the intersection, started to back up knowing that southbound traffic sometimes cuts the corner too sharply. However, V1's poor directional control and failure to properly navigate the left turn caused the collision with V2. Therefore, V1's failure to control their vehicle and properly execute the left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
