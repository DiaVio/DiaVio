The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an incorrect evasive action by steering to the right in an attempt to merge onto the interstate. This action caused V1 to lose control and travel off the roadway, ultimately resulting in the collision with the bridge abutment, highway sign, and center median wall. Additionally, the driver's inattention due to thinking about lunch, being distracted by the tractor-trailer, and traveling too fast for the conditions (including the presence of snow and black ice) contributed to the crash. The witness testimony also supports V1's primary responsibility, as they did not see any semi truck but only observed V1 crossing the interstate at a high speed.
