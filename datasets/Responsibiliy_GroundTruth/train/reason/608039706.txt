The reason for this is that the driver of the case vehicle attempted to merge left into a left-turn bay, but crossed the center line and entered the path of the westbound traffic. This action resulted in the case vehicle swiping the left-rear side of the trailer attached to V2, and subsequently colliding with V3 and V4. The driver of V4 attempted to avoid a collision, but was unable to do so. Therefore, the actions of the case vehicle driver in crossing the center line and failing to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the accident.
