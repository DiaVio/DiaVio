The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before proceeding through it. The driver stated that he did not see anyone approaching the intersection, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. This failure to properly observe the intersection and the oncoming vehicle (V2) resulted in the collision.
