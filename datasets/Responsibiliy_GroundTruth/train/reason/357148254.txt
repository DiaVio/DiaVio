The reason for this is that V2 was traveling northbound in the outside lane while the case vehicle, V1, was eastbound approaching the intersection. V2 struck V1 on the rear portion of the left-front door and forward of the gas cap cover on the quarter panel. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, causing the collision.
