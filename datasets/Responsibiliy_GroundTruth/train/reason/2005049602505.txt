The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling, turning left at intersection," and the critical reason for this event was "misjudgment of gap or others speed." Additionally, an associative factor was inattention due to having a phone conversation. These factors indicate that V1 failed to properly judge the speed and distance of oncoming traffic while making a left turn at the intersection, likely due to being distracted by the phone conversation. On the other hand, V2 (the 30-year-old male driving the Ford Explorer) was not coded with a critical reason for the crash. Although fatigue was a factor for V2, it does not appear to have directly contributed to the collision. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction, over left lane line," suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to misjudgment of the gap or others' speed while making a left turn at the intersection and being distracted by a phone conversation.
