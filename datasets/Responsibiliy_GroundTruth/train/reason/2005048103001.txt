The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a blackout while driving, causing him to cross the double yellow lane line and collide with V2 (the 2005 Lexus ES330). The medical records indicate that low blood sugar may have been the cause of the blackout, even though the driver had not been diagnosed as being diabetic. This physical impairment of the ability to act resulted in V1's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within their lane. On the other hand, V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" from the opposite direction, indicating that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident. Additionally, V2's driver was distracted by talking on her cell phone, which could be considered a contributing factor but not the primary cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's physical impairment leading to the loss of control and crossing into the opposite lane.
