The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions at the time of the crash. The road surface was wet, it was raining heavily, and parts of the roadway were under water. Additionally, the accumulation of dirt and grime on the road surface made it slick. The low tread depth on both rear tires of V1 further contributed to the lack of control. The driver's inexperience was also considered a factor.
