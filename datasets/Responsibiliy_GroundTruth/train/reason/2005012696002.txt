The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking to the left at another vehicle, which caused him to not see V2 (the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee) stopping in front of him. This distraction led to a recognition error, resulting in V1 colliding with the back of V2. Although the driver of V2 was slowing down for the light and was not completely stopped, he was not found to have contributed to the crash. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to his distraction and failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of him.
