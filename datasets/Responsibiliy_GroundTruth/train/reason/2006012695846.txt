The driver of V1 was traveling at a high speed of over 113 kmph (70 mph), which was well above the posted speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). Additionally, the witness reported that V1 was going even faster than their own speed of 75 mph. This excessive speed, combined with the driver's admission of aggressive driving, contributed to the loss of control of V1. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was found to have a BAC of .30, which is significantly above the legal limit for operating a vehicle. The alcohol intoxication likely impaired the driver's judgment, coordination, and reaction time, making it even more difficult for them to maintain control of the vehicle. Overall, the driver of V1's excessive speed, aggressive driving, and alcohol intoxication were the critical factors that led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with various objects. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
