The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 made a left turn without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic, specifically failing to see V2 (the 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse) approaching. This recognition error by the driver of V1 led to the collision between the two vehicles.
