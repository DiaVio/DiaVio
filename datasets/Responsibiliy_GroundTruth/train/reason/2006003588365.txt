The reason for this is that V2 was attempting to make a U-turn from the parking lane, which is an illegal maneuver. V1 (the Lexus ES300) was traveling straight in lane one and had the right of way. V1 tried to avoid the collision by stopping and steering to the left, but there was no space to maneuver and ended up hitting the left side of V2. Therefore, V2's illegal U-turn and failure to yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
