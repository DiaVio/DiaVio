The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to stop behind V2 when V2 came to a stop to ask the driver of the disabled vehicle if he needed any help. V1's driver was distracted by the driver of the disabled vehicle and did not see V2 come to a stop. If V1's driver had not been distracted, he would have had adequate time to avoid striking V2.
