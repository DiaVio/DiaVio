The reason for this is that V2 attempted to pass V1 on the left side without ensuring that it was safe to do so. V2 made a false assumption that V1 would continue forward instead of making a left turn. This false assumption led to V2 colliding with the left side of V1's trailer. Additionally, V2 claims that she did not observe a turn signal from V1, indicating that she did not take proper precautions before attempting to pass.
