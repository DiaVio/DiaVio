The driver of V1 stated that she was following the speed of traffic when V2 stopped. However, she admitted to being distracted by the red vehicle (V3) and failed to notice V2 stopping in front of her until it was too late. This indicates a lack of attention and awareness on the part of the driver of V1, which resulted in her rear-ending V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction.
