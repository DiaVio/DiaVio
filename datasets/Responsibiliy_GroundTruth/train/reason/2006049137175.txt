The reason for this is that V2 was making a u-turn from the eastbound lanes to the westbound lanes, and during this maneuver, V2 misjudged the gap or the speed of V1. V2 overestimated the time it would take to complete the u-turn, which resulted in V1 colliding with the right rear of the trailer. Therefore, V2's misjudgment and failure to yield to oncoming traffic while making the u-turn make them primarily responsible for the accident.
