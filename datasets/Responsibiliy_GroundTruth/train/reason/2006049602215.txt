The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver overcompensated when trying to avoid the large piece of a truck tire in their lane. This overcompensation caused V1 to lose control of the vehicle and enter into other lanes, ultimately resulting in the collision with V2 (the driver of the 1998 Oldsmobile Delta 88). V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment" and the critical reason was not coded to this vehicle, indicating that V2 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, V1's overcompensation and subsequent loss of control are the main factors that led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
