The driver of V1 made several errors that led to the accident. Firstly, they attempted to pass a semi-truck without ensuring they had enough space to do so safely. This decision to change lanes and pass the truck was a contributing factor to the crash. Additionally, the driver admitted to being tired after a long day of work, which likely impaired their judgment and reaction time. The driver's fatigue may have also contributed to their overcompensation when they realized they were too close to the semi-truck, causing them to steer off the roadway and ultimately lose control of their vehicle. Overall, the driver's poor decision-making, fatigue, and overcompensation were the primary reasons for the crash.
