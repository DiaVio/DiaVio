The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 attempted to press the brake but accidentally pressed the gas instead. This caused V1 to go through the parking spot, off the roadway, and ultimately collide with a building. The driver's error in pressing the wrong pedal led to the crash, making V1 primarily responsible.
