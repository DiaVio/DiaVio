The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that the Critical Pre-Crash Event coded to V1 was "Other motor vehicle stopped in lane" with an unknown recognition error. This suggests that V1 failed to recognize that V2 had come to a complete stop due to the school bus deploying its "swing arm" indicating a stop. V1's failure to recognize the stopped vehicle in front of them and subsequently colliding with it indicates their negligence and responsibility for the accident.
