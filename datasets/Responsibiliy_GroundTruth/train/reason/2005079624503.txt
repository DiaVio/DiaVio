The reason for this is that V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of V2 while making a left turn into westbound traffic. V1's misjudgment led to the front of V2 impacting the left side of V1. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was not attributed with any critical reason for the collision. Although V2 was unfamiliar with the roadway and tired from jetlag, V2's actions of applying the brakes when seeing V1 enter traffic indicate an attempt to avoid the collision. Therefore, V2 cannot be primarily held responsible for the accident.
