The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, which included heavy rain and water on the roadway. Additionally, the driver was an inexperienced driver and had low tire tread, particularly on the left and right rear tires. These factors likely contributed to V1 losing control and ultimately colliding with the barrier walls.
