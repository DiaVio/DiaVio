The case vehicle (V1) was involved in an initial non-injury producing impact, which caused a clockwise rotation in the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle departed the roadway and narrowly impacted a pole. This impact resulted in damage to the left fender and eventually led to the left-front drive wheel being impacted. The impact with the pole was likely a result of the vehicle's departure from the roadway, indicating that the driver of the case vehicle (V1) failed to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the fact that the airbag deployment was delayed suggests that the early model airbag sensor did not identify the crash as requiring immediate deployment. Furthermore, the injuries sustained by the driver, including the laceration over the right parieto-occipital region, the rupture of mucosa of the nose, and the contusion to the lower lip, indicate that the driver made contact with the header and the deploying steering-wheel airbag. The abrasion to the left neck and the left internal carotid artery dissection with thrombosis and neurological deficit suggest that the driver also made contact with the shoulder belt webbing. Overall, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the primary responsibility for the accident lies with the driver of the case vehicle (V1) due to their failure to maintain control of the vehicle, resulting in the departure from the roadway and subsequent impact with a pole.
