The reason for this is that V1 was swerving and ultimately departed from its lane, resulting in the collision with V2. The critical reason for V1's actions was attributed to a driver-related critical non-performance factor, specifically a heart attack or other physical impairment. This impairment likely caused V1 to lose control of the vehicle and veer into the path of V2. Therefore, V1's physical impairment and subsequent actions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
