The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection while his view of southbound traffic was obstructed by the city truck. This decision error, combined with the driver's unfamiliarity with the roadway and the sightline restriction caused by the truck, led to the collision with V1. Although V1 (the driver of the Chevrolet Tahoe) was also found to be inattentive and not paying attention to the roadway, the primary responsibility lies with V2 for failing to ensure it was safe to proceed into the intersection.
