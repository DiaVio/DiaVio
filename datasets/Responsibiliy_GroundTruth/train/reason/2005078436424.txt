The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection with an obstructed view. Even though the non-contact vehicle stopped and waved V1 to turn left, V1 failed to properly assess the situation and ensure that it was safe to proceed. V1 should have taken extra caution due to the obstructed view and the fact that V2 was approaching in the second lane. Therefore, V1's failure to exercise proper judgment and ensure a safe left turn makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
