The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver experienced a severe coughing attack and passed out at the wheel, resulting in V1 veering to the left and impacting V2, then crossing three lanes and impacting the right rear of V3. This loss of control and impairment of the driver's ability to act led to the chain of events that caused the crash.
