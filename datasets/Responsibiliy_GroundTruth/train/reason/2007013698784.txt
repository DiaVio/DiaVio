The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at an intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 stated that she stopped because she had a flashing red turn light and proceeded to make the left turn when she believed the traffic had cleared. However, she did not see V2 (the 1996 Oldsmobile Bravada) approaching in the second lane and was struck on the right side by V2's front bumper. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and had the right of way. The driver of V2 stated that she saw V1 waiting to turn and attempted to brake to avoid the collision, but was unable to do so. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
