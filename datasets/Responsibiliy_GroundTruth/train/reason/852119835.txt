The reason for this is that V1 swerved to the left just prior to impact with V2, indicating a sudden and potentially reckless maneuver. Additionally, V1's front right corner impacted the front right of V2, suggesting that V1 may have veered into the opposing lane, causing the collision. The subsequent rotation and impact with the concrete barrier further indicate a loss of control by V1.
