The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions. This is evident from the fact that V1 impacted the back of V2 (the 1998 Mercedes-Benz ML-320 SUV) while V2 was slowing down for traffic at an approaching intersection. The police reported travel speed for both vehicles was 48 kmph, indicating that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and react in time to the slowing vehicle in front.
