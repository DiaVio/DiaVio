The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver attempted a left turn onto the eastbound roadway without having a clear view of approaching traffic. The driver's view was obstructed by a parked vehicle, and she failed to see V2 (the 1981 Jeep Wagoneer) before the collision occurred. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by having a small dog on her lap while driving. Therefore, V1's failure to yield the right of way and turning with an obstructed view led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible.
