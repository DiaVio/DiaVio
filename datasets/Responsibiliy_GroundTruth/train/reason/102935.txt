The reason for this is that the driver of V1 experienced a syncopal episode due to a medical condition, which caused him to fall unconscious. As a result, V1 veered off the road, crossed a sidewalk, and collided with a tree. The fact that the driver lost consciousness and was unable to control the vehicle indicates that V1 was the primary cause of the accident.
