The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. They reported that they were watching another vehicle pass through the intersection and did not observe V2's approach. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to their failure to properly observe and yield to oncoming traffic.
