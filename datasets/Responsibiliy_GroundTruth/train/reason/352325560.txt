The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the traffic circle and began to slide counterclockwise, ultimately sliding into the eastbound travel lane and being struck by the frontal plane of Vehicle 1 (2009 Honda Accord). This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield to oncoming traffic and caused the collision.
