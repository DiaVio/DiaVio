The reason for this is that V1 lost control while exiting a right curve and crossed over the double yellow line into the northbound travel lane, where it impacted the front of Vehicle #2 (V2), the 2000 four-door Mazda Protégé. V1 left skid marks of 91 feet before the impact, indicating that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, V2 had just exited a right curve and locked up its brakes upon seeing V1 in its travel lane, suggesting that V2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's loss of control and crossing into the oncoming lane.
