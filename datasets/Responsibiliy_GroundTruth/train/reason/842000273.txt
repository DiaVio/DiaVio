The reason for this is that Vehicle #1, driven by a 37-year-old female, made a left-hand turn onto the municipal street, encroaching into the lane being occupied by Vehicle #2. This indicates that Vehicle #1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle #2, which was traveling straight on the US Highway. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of Vehicle #2 attempted to take evasive action by swerving to the right, indicating that Vehicle #2 was not at fault for the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
