The reason for this is that V2 attempted to make a right turn from lane two while next to V1, causing the front of V2 to impact the left side of V1. This indicates that V2 made an illegal maneuver by turning from the wrong lane and did not have the right of way. Additionally, V2 left the scene of the crash without stopping, which further demonstrates a lack of responsibility.
