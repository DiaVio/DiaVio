The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 (the 1996 Honda Accord) after V2 stopped abruptly due to traffic congestion. V1's driver stated that he was distracted by "food, objects, pet, etc." and was unable to avoid the crash even though he steered left and applied the brakes. The police officer at the scene also reported that V1's driver was distracted. Therefore, V1's driver's distraction and failure to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
