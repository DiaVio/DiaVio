The reason for this is that V2 lost control and began to spin counterclockwise, placing its left plane perpendicular to traffic. This action caused V1, the 2008 Ford F150 FX2 Sport pickup, to steer left in an attempt to avoid or go around V2. The impact between the left front of V2 and the right side of V1 resulted in minimal damage. However, this contact caused V1 to steer right more severely than intended, leading to a clockwise yaw and ultimately causing V1 to roll onto its left side. Therefore, the initial loss of control by V2 triggered the chain of events that led to the accident.
