The reason for this is that V1 was driving over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating that they were not staying within their designated lane. Additionally, the critical reason for the crash was coded to V1 as a driver-related factor, specifically driving too fast for the curve. This suggests that V1 was not adjusting their speed appropriately for the road conditions and the curvature of the roadway, leading to the collision with V2.
