The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than V2 (the Nissan Altima) and failed to maintain a safe following distance. The driver of V1 noticed the slowing vehicle ahead but was unable to stop or avoid the collision, resulting in the impact between the front left of V1 and the right rear of V2. Additionally, V1 traveled off the roadway and rolled over after the initial impact, indicating a loss of control on the part of the driver.
