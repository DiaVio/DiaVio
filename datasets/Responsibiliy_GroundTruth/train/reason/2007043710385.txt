The reason for this is that V2 made a left turn into the path of V1, failing to yield the right of way. V2 stated that he was waved across by a nice driver in the opposing lane, but he failed to properly assess the traffic conditions before proceeding. Additionally, V2 mentioned that his vision was obstructed by the stopped vehicles in the left lane, which further contributed to his inability to see V1 approaching. While V1 was traveling at the authorized speed limit, it was determined that V1 was traveling too fast considering the congestion in the left lane. However, V1's speed alone does not absolve V2 of responsibility for making an unsafe left turn.
