The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over left lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the left lane line, encroaching into the path of V1. Additionally, V2's driver stated that she did not see V1 until they were in the intersection, suggesting inadequate surveillance on her part. Therefore, V2's failure to maintain her lane and inadequate surveillance make her primarily responsible for the accident.
