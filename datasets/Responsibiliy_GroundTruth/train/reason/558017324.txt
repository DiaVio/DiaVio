The reason for this is that V2 was stopped in the mouth of a private drive, waiting to make a right turn onto the same highway. As V2 completed its right turn, the case vehicle (V1, the 1997 Dodge Caravan mini-van) was already in the middle of its left turn, heading east. V2's right turn into the path of V1 resulted in the collision.
