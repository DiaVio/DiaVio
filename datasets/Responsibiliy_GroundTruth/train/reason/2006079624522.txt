The reason for this is that the driver of V1 inadvertently pressed the gas pedal instead of the brakes when attempting to brake for the stopped traffic ahead. This driver error led to V1 colliding with the back of V2 (the 1997 Honda Accord), which then caused V2 to collide with the back of V3 (the 1995 Lincoln Town Car). Therefore, V1's failure to properly control their vehicle and respond to the stopped traffic ahead resulted in the chain reaction collision involving all three vehicles.
