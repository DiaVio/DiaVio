The reason for this is that the driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel after working for 22 hours straight and not having slept in two days. This extreme fatigue and lack of sleep directly contributed to the driver losing control of the vehicle, crossing over the centerline, and ultimately crashing into a rock wall and utility wire. The driver's admission of falling asleep and the evidence of his excessive work hours clearly indicate that driver fatigue was the main factor in causing the accident.
