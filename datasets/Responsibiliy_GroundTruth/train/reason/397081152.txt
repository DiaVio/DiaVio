The driver of V1 was not using the available manual restraints at the time of the crash, indicating a failure to take necessary precautions for safety. Additionally, the driver of V1 sustained injuries consistent with loading the steering wheel rim and knee bolster, suggesting that they were not properly controlling the vehicle or maintaining a safe distance from V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's negligence in not using available restraints and failure to maintain control of the vehicle.
