The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being temporarily blinded by the glare from the sun as he rounded the curve and broke cover of the trees. This environmental factor of glare impaired his visibility, causing him to cross the centerline and sideswipe V2 (the 2003 GMC Yukon) and V3 (the 2003 Lincoln Aviator). V1 then continued to drive in the wrong lane and collided head-on with V4 (the 1988 Jaguar XJS). V1's poor directional control, combined with the environmental factor of glare, led to the sequence of events resulting in the crash.
