The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a person standing on the sidewalk, which caused him to not notice that the vehicles ahead were stopped. This distraction led to V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and subsequently resulted in the rear-end collision with V2 (the Chevrolet Cavalier). V2, on the other hand, was stopped at the time of the crash and did not contribute to the critical pre-crash event. Therefore, V2 cannot be considered primarily responsible for the collision.
