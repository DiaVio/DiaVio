The reason for this is that V2 entered the intersection without stopping at the stop sign and made a right turn directly into the path of V1 (the 1999 Honda Accord). This action by V2 caused the collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, it was found that the driver of V2 was under the influence of alcohol with a BAC of .28, which further contributed to their impaired judgment and ability to safely navigate the intersection.
