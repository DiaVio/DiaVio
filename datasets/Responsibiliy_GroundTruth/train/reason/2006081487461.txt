The driver of V1 made a decision to change lanes to the left without sufficient clearance from V2 (the driver of the 2004 Nissan Quest). This action resulted in V1 encroaching into the path of V2, causing the sideswipe collision and subsequent impact with the center barrier. The driver of V1 was assigned contributing circumstances such as not granting right of way, following too closely, and exceeding a reasonable safe speed. Additionally, the critical reason for the collision was determined to be the incorrect evasive action taken by the driver of V1, steering left into V2's path of travel to avoid the forward impact.
