The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it ran off the right side of the road onto the dirt shoulder. V1's driver then attempted to re-enter the roadway but crossed into the eastbound lane, causing a rollover accident. This indicates that V1's driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle and made unsafe maneuvers, resulting in the accident.
