The driver of V1 was traveling at a speed of approximately 72 kmph (45 mph), which exceeds the speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph) for the roadway. Additionally, the driver admitted to being distracted by thoughts of an upcoming free dinner, indicating a lack of attention to the road. When the driver encountered the coyote on the roadway, instead of applying the brakes and attempting to avoid the animal safely, the driver steered to the left without taking appropriate evasive action. This incorrect evasive action resulted in V1 departing the roadway and colliding with a boulder and a tree. Furthermore, the driver stated that he "blacked out" and woke up in darkness, indicating a possible loss of consciousness or impairment. This raises concerns about the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. Overall, the driver's inattention, excessive speed, poor evasive action, and potential impairment contribute to V1 being primarily responsible for the accident.
