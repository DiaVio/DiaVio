The driver of V1 admitted that he had an obstructed view due to a large truck parked on the side of the northbound roadway. Despite this obstruction, he proceeded to make a left turn without taking any avoidance maneuvers. This indicates a driver-related error of turning with an obstructed view. Additionally, the driver of V1 had physical conditions of high blood pressure and heart disease, as well as the use of several prescription medications, which may have affected his ability to make a safe decision while driving. On the other hand, V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit and attempted to avoid the collision by applying brakes and steering left. The driver of V2 had associated factors such as worry about a job interview, physical condition of having an ulcer, unfamiliarity with the roadway, and a sightline restriction caused by the parked truck. However, none of these factors directly contributed to the cause of the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to turning with an obstructed view and failing to take appropriate actions to avoid the collision.
