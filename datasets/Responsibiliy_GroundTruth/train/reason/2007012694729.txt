The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn onto the southbound roadway. The driver of V1 stated that his view was obstructed by the berm along the side of the north/south roadway, but it was determined that a driver who comes to a complete stop at the intersection can see traffic to the left (traffic heading northbound). Additionally, the driver of V1 did not slow or stop before exiting the school driveway, indicating a lack of proper surveillance. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Impala) had an associated factor of the presence of the berm on her right, which obstructed her view of traffic approaching the intersection from the school driveway until the very last moment. However, this does not absolve V1 of responsibility for failing to properly surveil the intersection before making the left turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
