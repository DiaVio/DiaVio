The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver, a fifteen-year-old male, fell asleep at the wheel, which caused the vehicle to cross the center lane line. When the driver realized he was out of his lane, he abruptly steered to the right, resulting in the vehicle rotating clockwise and ultimately rolling over. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that the driver's fatigue and falling asleep were the main factors leading to the crash. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as he had only been driving for two months, and overcompensation were associated factors in the crash. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to the driver's fatigue and falling asleep at the wheel.
