The driver of V1 failed to yield to the red light and attempted to cross the intersection after the light had turned amber. This recognition error and internal distraction of conversing with passengers led to the collision with V2 (the 1999 Chevrolet Malibu) that was traveling east in lane two. V1 then rotated clockwise and slid south to contact V3 (the 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier) on its front bumper with V1's left fender. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield to the red light and their recognition error caused by internal distraction.
