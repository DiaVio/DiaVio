The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made an improper lane change, sideswiping V2 (the driver of the Pontiac G-6) while attempting to change lanes into the HOV lane. V1's failure to adequately surveil the adjacent lane and properly assess the safety of the lane change resulted in the collision. Additionally, V1's failure to stop after the collision and not realizing that they had hit another vehicle further supports their primary responsibility for the accident.
