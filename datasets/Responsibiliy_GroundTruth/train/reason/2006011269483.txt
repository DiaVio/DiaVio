The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the road conditions. The driver admitted to being in a hurry and worrying about being late, which led to a decision error of traveling at a speed between 56-64kmph (35-40mph) on an ice-covered roadway with a posted speed limit of 89kmph (55mph). This excessive speed for the conditions caused V1 to lose control and slide off the road, ultimately colliding with a tree.
