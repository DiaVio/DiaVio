The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2, who had the right of way. V1 stated that she did not see V2 coming and thought the traffic was clear for her to proceed. However, V1 failed to properly assess the situation and failed to yield to oncoming traffic. Additionally, V1 mentioned that there was another car in the right lane slowing down to make a right turn, which may have obstructed her view. Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the driver making the left turn to ensure that it is safe to do so before proceeding. On the other hand, V2 was traveling within the speed limit and had the right of way. V2 stated that she did not see V1 until it was in front of her, as her view was blocked by the car turning right. While this may have contributed to the accident, V2 was not primarily responsible as she was driving within the rules of the road. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way and not properly assessing the situation before making the left turn.
