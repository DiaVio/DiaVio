The reason for this is that V1 was traveling over the lane line on the right side of the travel lane, which indicates that V1 was not staying within its lane. This action caused V1 to strike the left side of V2, which was stopped due to congested traffic. Since V1 left the scene and no further information is available for the driver, it is not possible to determine the exact reason for V1's actions. However, the fact that V1 was not staying within its lane suggests a lack of attention or control on the part of the driver.
