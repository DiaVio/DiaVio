The reason for this is that V2 was engaged in a contest of speed with V1 and was tailgating V1 prior to the impact. V2 failed to maintain a safe following distance and exhibited poor directional control, resulting in the rear-end collision with V1. The driver of V2 was also reported to be traveling too fast for the road conditions. Therefore, the actions and behavior of the driver of V2 directly contributed to the crash events.
