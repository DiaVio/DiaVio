The driver of V1 admitted to not seeing V2 (the 1993 Ford Explorer) before pulling out of the gas station parking lot. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, V1's statement that she would not have been contacted if V2 had not steered into the turn lane suggests that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. While V2 did steer to the left and hit the brakes to avoid the collision, V2's actions can be seen as a reaction to V1's failure to yield. V2's statement that V1 did not even look her way further supports V1's responsibility for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way.
