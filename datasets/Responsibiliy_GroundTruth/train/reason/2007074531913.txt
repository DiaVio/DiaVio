The reason for this is that V2 was traveling over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident was coded to V2 as a driver-related factor: overcompensation. This suggests that V2's overreaction to the situation, possibly due to panic and the distraction of the 18-wheeler, led to the loss of control and subsequent collision with V1. It is important to note that V1 was not found to have any critical reasons or factors contributing to the accident.
