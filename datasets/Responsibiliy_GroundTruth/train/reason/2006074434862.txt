The reason for this is that Vehicle One stalled and came to a controlled stop in the first lane, without any adverse weather conditions present. The driver of Vehicle One then turned off the lights to get more power from the battery, which resulted in the vehicle being in a stationary position without any warning lights or indicators to alert other drivers. Vehicle Two (1997 Honda Passport) was traveling in the same lane and was unable to avoid the collision, despite attempting to brake. The driver of Vehicle Two stated that there was a car in front of him that swerved and missed Vehicle One, indicating that there was enough time and space for Vehicle Two to react and avoid the collision if Vehicle One had been properly illuminated or if the driver had taken appropriate measures to warn other drivers of the stalled vehicle. Therefore, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the rear-end collision due to its failure to properly indicate its stationary position, which resulted in Vehicle Two being unable to avoid the crash.
