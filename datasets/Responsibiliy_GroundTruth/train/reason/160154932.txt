The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 entered the northbound travel lane, causing the collision with Vehicle 1. The driver of Vehicle 1 did not have the opportunity to react or avoid the collision, as there was no skidding into the impact area by either vehicle. Therefore, the fault lies with the driver of Vehicle 2 for encroaching into the wrong lane of travel.
