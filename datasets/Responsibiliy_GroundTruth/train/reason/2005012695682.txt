The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 reported not seeing V2 (the 1999 Chevrolet Suburban) ahead of her. This indicates a recognition error and driver inattention on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, V1 was the vehicle that made contact with the back of V2, suggesting that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance. It is important to note that the driver of V2 was not thought to have contributed to the crash, as the critical reason for the critical precrash event was not coded to her.
