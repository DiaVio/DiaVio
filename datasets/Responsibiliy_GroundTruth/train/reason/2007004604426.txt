The reason for V1's responsibility is that they entered the intersection without observing the traffic signal. V1 admitted that the light changed from yellow to red, but they failed to stop and slid into the intersection, ultimately striking V2. This indicates that V1 did not follow the traffic laws and failed to yield the right of way to V2, who had the green light to proceed through the intersection. Additionally, the critical reason for the accident involving V1 was determined to be "traveling too fast for conditions." The wet road conditions due to rain created a slick surface with low friction, making it more difficult for V1 to stop in time to avoid the collision. This further supports V1's responsibility for the accident.
