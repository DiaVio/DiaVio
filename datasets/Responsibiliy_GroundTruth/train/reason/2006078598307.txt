The driver of V-1 admitted to using a hand-held cell phone while driving, which is a distraction and illegal in many jurisdictions. This distraction likely contributed to her failure to notice the red light and the presence of V-2 (the Nissan Altima) in the intersection. Additionally, V-1 was traveling at a speed of 56 kph (35 mph) when the speed limit was 72 kph (45 mph), indicating that she was not adhering to the posted speed limit. V-2, on the other hand, was stopped in the westbound, number two lane while waiting for a red light to change. V-2 entered the intersection on a green light and was struck by V-1, who failed to stop at the red light. Therefore, V-2's actions do not appear to be a contributing factor to the accident. In summary, V-1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her disregard for the traffic control device (red light) and her distracted driving behavior.
