The reason for this is that V1 was driving aggressively, trying to avoid being cut off by another vehicle. V1 admitted to speeding up to prevent the SUV from cutting him off again. However, in doing so, V1 failed to pay attention to the traffic in front of him and ultimately rear-ended V2 (the Nissan Maxima) which was stopped for a traffic control device. V2, on the other hand, was simply stopped in the same lane due to the traffic control device and was not engaged in any aggressive driving behavior. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident.
