The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made an aggressive lane change to pass another vehicle, accelerating at a high rate of speed. This behavior caused V1 to lose control and veer off the roadway, resulting in the accident. The driver admitted that he knew better than to drive the particular vehicle in that manner, indicating a lack of responsibility and awareness.
