The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions." The driver-related factor was also identified as "too fast for conditions (snowing/sleeting with wet, slushy roadway)." This indicates that the driver of V1 was driving at a speed that was not appropriate for the road conditions, which ultimately led to the loss of control and the subsequent crash.
