The reason for this determination is that V1 was the vehicle involved in the crash and was found at its final rest after striking a metal pole. V1 had partially departed the roadway and its right side tires were on the sidewalk. The driver initially stated that she had an accident and later claimed that her brakes weren't working, but it was later revealed that her brakes were not actually faulty. The driver made some sort of error that led to the unstable situation on the roadway. Additionally, the driver's behavior after the crash, such as not wanting photographs of her vehicle to be taken and being advised by the tow truck operator to say her brakes weren't working, suggests a possible attempt to avoid responsibility or manipulate the situation. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's error or mistake that led to the vehicle departing the roadway and striking the metal pole.
