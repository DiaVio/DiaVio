The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions, as indicated by the Critical Precrash Event and associated factors. The driver's false assumption of V2's actions, combined with the slippery road conditions due to rain, led to V1 losing control and initiating the collision. V2, the driver of the Toyota Tacoma, also had a Critical Precrash Event related to encroachment from the same direction over the right lane line. However, V2's actions were a reaction to V1's loss of control, and the driver could not avoid hitting V1. In summary, V1's excessive speed for the wet road conditions and false assumption of V2's actions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
