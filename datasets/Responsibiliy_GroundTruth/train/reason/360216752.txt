The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it was turning left out of a driveway and entered the lane of travel of Vehicle two (V2), the 1988 GMC C1500 large pickup truck. V2 attempted to brake and steer left to avoid the collision, but the front of V2 still impacted the left side of V1. This indicates that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2 and caused the collision.
