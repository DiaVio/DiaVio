The reason for this is that V1's right side tires dropped off the west road edge just prior to the intersection, causing it to skid and depart the right side of the road. This loss of control ultimately led to V1's impact with the traffic light pole and the subsequent rotation and impact with the same pole using the right front passenger door.
