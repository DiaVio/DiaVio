The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 drifted left and crossed the northbound travel lane, eventually departing the roadway. It then traveled across a grass embankment/ditch area, over a raised driveway, and landed with its front right corner and right rear wheel contacting the ground. This caused Vehicle 1 to roll approximately 30 meters before coming to rest off-road. The driver of Vehicle 1 was not restrained by her seatbelt, which may have contributed to the severity of her injuries.
