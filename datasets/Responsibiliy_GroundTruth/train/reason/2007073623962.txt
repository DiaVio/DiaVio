The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit, between 66-80 kmph (41-50 mph), which indicates aggressive driving. Additionally, V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection and did not see V2 until just before the crash. V1 also traveled to the left, crossing over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane, which contributed to the collision. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2004 Chevrolet Trailblazer) was stopped in the median, waiting to turn left, and was not coded as the critical reason for the crash. Therefore, V2's actions do not appear to be a significant contributing factor to the accident. In summary, V1's aggressive driving, inadequate surveillance, and crossing over the lane line make them primarily responsible for the collision.
