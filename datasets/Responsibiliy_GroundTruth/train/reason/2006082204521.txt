The driver of V1 failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and did not notice that traffic had come to a stop. This lack of attention and failure to react in time resulted in V1 colliding with the rear of V2 (the 1997 Ford Taurus), which then caused V2 to collide with the rear of V3 (the 2003 Ford Focus). Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to stop in time are the main factors contributing to the accident.
