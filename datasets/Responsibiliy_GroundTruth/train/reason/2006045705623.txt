The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 departed the right side of the road, blowing the two right tires on the curb and continuing north parallel to the road, indicating a loss of control. - V1 crossed the entry road to the apartment complex, impacting the curb with all four tires, further demonstrating a lack of control. - V1 struck a sign with the front end, indicating a failure to maintain proper lane position. - V1 traveled down an embankment and came to rest in a grassy area, suggesting a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. These actions and behaviors indicate that V1's driver was distracted, fatigued, and had poor directional control. Additionally, the driver's failure to look far enough ahead and unfamiliarity with the vehicle further contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
