The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was crossing over the eastbound lanes of the U.S. Highway from the crossover in an attempt to head south on the arterial road. Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was traveling in the right lane of the U.S. Highway. As a result, Vehicle 1 struck Vehicle 2 on the right side. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle 2 was identified as "This Vehicle Traveling, Crossing over (passing through intersection)." This indicates that Vehicle 2 was in the process of crossing the intersection when the crash occurred. Furthermore, the critical reason for the critical event of Vehicle 2 was coded as an "Unknown Recognition Error." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle 2 may have failed to properly recognize or perceive the oncoming traffic on the U.S. Highway, leading to the collision. In summary, Vehicle 2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to its failure to yield the right of way and its crossing of the eastbound lanes without proper recognition of the oncoming traffic.
