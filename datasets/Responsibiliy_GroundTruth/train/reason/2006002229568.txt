The reason for this is that V1 failed to stay in its lane, crossed the left lane line, and struck V2. The witness also observed V1 going back and forth over the center double lines, indicating that the driver was having difficulty controlling the vehicle. The critical precrash event for V1 was coded as a vehicle control loss due to a disabling vehicle failure, specifically a broken rear axle. This mechanical failure likely contributed to V1's inability to stay in its lane and ultimately caused the collision with V2.
