The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she made a left turn without having a clear view of the oncoming traffic. She stated that her view was obstructed by the SUV in the opposing left turn lane. Despite not being able to see the traffic completely, she proceeded to make the left turn, assuming that there were no more cars coming. This decision error led to the collision with V2. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2007 Toyota Yaris) attempted to avoid the collision by locking the brakes, but was unable to stop in time. V2's actions suggest that she was attentive and reacted appropriately to the situation, but the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making an unsafe left turn without a clear view of the oncoming traffic.
