The driver of Vehicle One admitted to not seeing Vehicle Two while attempting to make a left turn onto the private drive. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of Vehicle One. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle Two reported seeing Vehicle One making the left turn in front of her, indicating that she was aware of the situation and attempted to avoid the crash by applying full brakes. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle One for failing to adequately survey the intersection before making the left turn.
