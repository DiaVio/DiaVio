The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while re-entering lane two after passing a non-contact vehicle on the right. This indicates poor directional control, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the driver's inexperience, as he only had three months of driving experience, likely contributed to the loss of control. The slick bridge surface due to rain and ice also played a role in the crash.
