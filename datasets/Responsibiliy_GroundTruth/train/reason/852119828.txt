The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, while V2, the 2001 Chevrolet K2 large pickup truck, was traveling straight through the intersection. In this scenario, V1 is required to yield to oncoming traffic, which includes V2. However, V1 failed to yield and collided with the front of V2. Additionally, V1 post-impact rotated counterclockwise 90 degrees, indicating that V1 was likely at fault for the collision. The fact that V1 was towed from the scene further suggests that it sustained more damage, reinforcing its primary responsibility for the accident.
