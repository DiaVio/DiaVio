The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 was entering the roadway from a driveway and failed to yield to oncoming traffic. The Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #1 was coded as a Recognition Error, specifically inadequate surveillance. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #1 did not properly observe or assess the situation before entering the roadway, leading to the collision with Vehicle #2. On the other hand, Vehicle #2 (2001 Dodge Neon) was already on the roadway and stated that she had seen Vehicle #1 stop at the end of the driveway before continuing without yielding. Vehicle #2 attempted to steer to the left and brake to avoid the crash, indicating that she took appropriate evasive action. Therefore, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to yield and inadequate surveillance.
