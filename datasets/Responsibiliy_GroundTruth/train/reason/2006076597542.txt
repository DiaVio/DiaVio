The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by looking to the right to see the train coming, and failed to notice that V2 (the Peterbilt tractor) had come to a stop for the railroad crossing. This distraction caused V1 to collide with the rear of V2. Additionally, V1's driver was taking pre-natal vitamins as medication, which may have contributed to her distraction or impaired her ability to focus on the road. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to driver-related factors, specifically external distraction.
