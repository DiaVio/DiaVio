The reason for this is that V1 failed to recognize that traffic was not moving through the intersection and did not reduce their speed accordingly. The driver's false assumption that traffic would continue to proceed, along with their internal distraction of looking inside the vehicle, contributed to the recognition error. Additionally, the driver's normal pattern of behavior of being in a hurry, along with potential factors such as fatigue and work-related stress, may have further impaired their ability to react appropriately in the situation.
