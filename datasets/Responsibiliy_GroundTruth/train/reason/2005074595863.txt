The reason for this is that the driver of V1 attempted a left turn without accurately judging the speed and gap of V2 (the tan 1999 Mazda Protege). Additionally, the driver of V1 had less than one year of driving experience, which may have contributed to their misjudgment. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the Mazda Protege) had the right of way as they were traveling straight through the intersection and the traffic control signal was green for their direction of travel. The driver of V2 also did not see a turn signal activated on V1, indicating that they were not aware of V1's intention to turn left. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their misjudgment of the gap and speed of V2 while attempting a left turn.
