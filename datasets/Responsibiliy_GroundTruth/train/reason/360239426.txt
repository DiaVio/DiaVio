The reason for this is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, crossed the centerline, and began to rotate counterclockwise. This loss of control resulted in V1 impacting several objects, including a curb, poles, a street sign, and a train track. The driver's inability to maintain control of the vehicle and the subsequent impacts indicate that V1 was the primary cause of the accident.
