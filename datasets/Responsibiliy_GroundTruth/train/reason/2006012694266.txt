The reason for this is that Vehicle #1 failed to notice that the traffic had stopped and did not react in time to avoid a collision. This is evident from the fact that Vehicle #1's front contacted the left rear of Vehicle #2, pushing it forward. Additionally, Vehicle #1 crossed the double yellow centerlines and its front contacted the front of Vehicle #3. Vehicle #2, on the other hand, was stopped in line with other vehicles, waiting to make a left turn at the traffic light. Vehicle #2 did not contribute to the cause of the accident. Therefore, Vehicle #1's failure to recognize the stopped traffic and react appropriately makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
