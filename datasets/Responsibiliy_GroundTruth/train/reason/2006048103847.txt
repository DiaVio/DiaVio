The reason for this is that V1 attempted to pass through the intersection without adequately surveilling the area. The driver of V1 stated that she looked both ways before entering the intersection, but she failed to see the approaching Vehicle two (V2). This indicates that V1's driver was not paying sufficient attention to her surroundings, leading to the collision with V2.
