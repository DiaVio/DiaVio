The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by a joke being told by his co-worker, which involved hand movements. This distraction caused the driver to take his attention away from the road ahead, only returning his attention just before the impact. This internal distraction is a driver-related factor that contributed to the crash. V2 (the driver of the 1996 Honda Accord) was stopped, waiting for oncoming traffic to pass before intending to turn left. V2 was not found to have any critical reasons or factors contributing to the crash. Therefore, V1's distraction and failure to maintain attention on the road ahead make them primarily responsible for the accident.
