The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was internally distracted, looking down at the tachometer and adjusting the navigation system, which caused the vehicle to cross the centerline of the roadway. The driver then overcompensated, leading to the clockwise rotation and ultimately the crash. Additionally, the driver was in violation of a restriction on his license by not having a licensed driver over the age of 25 present in the vehicle while he was driving.
