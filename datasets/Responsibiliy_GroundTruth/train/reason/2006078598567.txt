The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 looked right and left after waiting for traffic to clear, but did not detect V2 approaching from the right. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not properly assess the oncoming traffic and failed to see V2 before proceeding with the left turn. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was a 16-year-old with only 6 months of driving experience and no driver education. This lack of experience and training may have contributed to the driver's failure to properly assess the intersection and detect the approaching vehicle. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right of way to V2.
