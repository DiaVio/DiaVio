The driver of V1 failed to see the vehicles stopped in front of them due to a non-contact vehicle blocking their view. This resulted in V1 attempting to change lanes but ultimately colliding with the back of V2 (the Chevrolet Nova sedan), which then caused a chain reaction of collisions with V3 (the Dodge Caravan passenger van) and V4 (the Land Rover Discovery). V1's failure to respond appropriately to the unexpected actions of others and their inability to adjust their speed to the traffic conditions make them primarily responsible for the accident.
