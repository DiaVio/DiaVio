The reason for V1's responsibility is that it changed lanes abruptly and attempted to pass a non-contact vehicle without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This sudden lane change and subsequent evasive action caused V1 to lose control of the vehicle, resulting in the crash. Additionally, the fact that the driver admitted to drinking coffee with her left hand at the time of the crash suggests a potential distraction that may have contributed to the incorrect evasive action taken by V1.
