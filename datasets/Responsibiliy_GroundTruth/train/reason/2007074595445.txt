The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver lost control of their vehicle due to a bump on the wet road. Despite the loss of control, the driver of V1 accelerated and made multiple steering maneuvers, which ultimately resulted in their vehicle crossing into the southbound lane and colliding with V2. This indicates a failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle and respond appropriately to the road conditions. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1997 GMC Jimmy) attempted to avoid the crash by applying the brakes and steering to the left. However, V2's actions were in response to V1's loss of control and encroachment into the southbound lane, making them a secondary factor in the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to control the vehicle and respond appropriately to the road conditions, while V2's actions were a reaction to V1's loss of control.
