The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it ran through a red light, as stated by the witness who was traveling behind V2. The witness reported that V1 had the red light for a few seconds, indicating that the driver of V1 had enough time to see the red light and stop. This illegal maneuver of running a red light resulted in the collision with V2, which was lawfully traveling through the intersection on a steady green light. Therefore, V1's failure to stop at the red light and the resulting collision make it primarily responsible for the accident.
