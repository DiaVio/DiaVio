The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down inside his vehicle, which caused him to not notice that V2 had stopped in front of him. He stated that he never saw any brake lights illuminated on V2, indicating that he was not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead. Additionally, data from V1's vehicle indicated that the brakes were not applied prior to the impact, suggesting a lack of awareness and reaction from the driver. While V2 (the driver of the 2007 Ford Explorer) was stopped for a red traffic signal, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle traveling in the same direction with higher speed." However, without further information or the ability to interview the driver of V2, it is difficult to determine if there were any contributing factors on their part. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the rear-end crash due to driver-related error and distraction, as well as a failure to apply the brakes in a timely manner.
