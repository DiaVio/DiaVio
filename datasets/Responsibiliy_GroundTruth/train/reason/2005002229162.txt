The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 fell asleep while negotiating the curve, causing the vehicle to cross the northbound lane and go off the left side of the roadway. This critical non-performance error of falling asleep directly led to the crash. The driver's statement, along with the fact that she had only 5 hours of sleep prior to the crash and had been out the previous night, supports the conclusion that driver fatigue was a significant factor in the accident.
