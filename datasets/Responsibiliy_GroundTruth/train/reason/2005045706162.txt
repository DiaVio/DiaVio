The reason for Vehicle 1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a decision error by falsely assuming that they had the right-of-way since the traffic signal was solid green. This false assumption led to Vehicle 1 proceeding into the intersection to make a left turn, resulting in the collision with Vehicle 2 (the 1990 Toyota Four Runner). Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 did not slow down or hit the brakes before the crash, indicating a lack of awareness or reaction to the situation. While Vehicle 2's driver also made a false assumption by assuming that Vehicle 1 would yield the right of way, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle 1 due to their decision error and failure to slow down or brake before the collision.
