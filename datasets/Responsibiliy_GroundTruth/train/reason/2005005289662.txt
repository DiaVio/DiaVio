The reason for V1's primary responsibility is inadequate surveillance. V1 attempted to change lanes from lane one to lane two without properly checking for other vehicles, specifically V2 (the driver of the Nissan Sentra). This lack of surveillance resulted in the left side of V1 making contact with the right side of V2, initiating the crash. V2, on the other hand, was not found to have contributed to the crash. The Critical Precrash Event coded to V2 was other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V2 was encroached upon by V1 from the adjacent lane over the right lane line. However, no other factors were attributed to V2 as a cause of the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1's inadequate surveillance and lane change attempt without properly checking for other vehicles makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
