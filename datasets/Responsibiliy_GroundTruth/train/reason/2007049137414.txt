The reason for V1's responsibility is that it struck the back of V2 (the 1997 Ford Escort), which was legally parked in the right parking lane. Additionally, V1 veered across multiple lanes before coming to rest in another crossing street. The fact that the occupants of V1 fled the scene further suggests their responsibility for the crash.
