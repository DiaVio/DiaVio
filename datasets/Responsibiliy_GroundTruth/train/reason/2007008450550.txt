The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was transporting her two young children without restraints, which is a violation of traffic safety regulations. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver turned around in her seat to communicate with the children, which likely caused her to lose control of the vehicle and depart from the roadway. This negligent behavior contributed to the crash and makes V1 primarily responsible.
