The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 initiated evasive maneuvers by changing lanes multiple times to avoid a collision with the work pickup. This resulted in over-steering and loss of traction, causing V1 to rotate and ultimately depart from the road. The driver's overcompensation while attempting to correct the over-steerage led to the loss of control and subsequent crash. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's actions and overcompensation.
