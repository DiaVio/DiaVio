The reason for V1's primary responsibility is their inadequate surveillance and failure to look left again before pulling out. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to ensure that it was safe to make the left turn onto the 5-lane roadway. V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway also contributed to their failure to properly assess the situation.
