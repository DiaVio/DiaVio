The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast while trying to gain control of the vehicle after experiencing a tire tread separation. Instead of safely pulling off to the left side of the roadway onto the emergency paved shoulder, the driver hit the left side concrete barrier wall, causing the vehicle to roll over. This indicates that the driver was not able to maintain control of the vehicle and failed to take appropriate actions to prevent the crash.
