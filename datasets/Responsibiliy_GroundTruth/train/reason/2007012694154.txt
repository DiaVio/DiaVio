The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to recognize the red light at the intersection due to internal distractions, including conversation with her passenger and inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 was also engaged in an illegal maneuver by running a red light. While V2 (the 2003 Chevrolet Venture) was involved in the crash, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as other vehicle encroachment from crossing street, across path. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to recognize the red light and engaging in an illegal maneuver.
