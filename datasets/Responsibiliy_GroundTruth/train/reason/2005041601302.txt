The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 had a recognition error and was inattentive, which led to the crash. Additionally, V1 was unable to stop in time to prevent the collision, indicating a failure to maintain a safe following distance. V2 (the 2002 Jeep Cherokee) was able to stop in time to avoid hitting the unknown vehicle that cut in front of it, indicating that V2 was attentive and able to react appropriately to the situation. Therefore, V1's inattention and failure to stop in time make them primarily responsible for the crash.
