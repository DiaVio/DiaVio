The reason for this is that the driver of V1 made a left turn without yielding the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Toyota Corolla). The driver of V1 falsely assumed that V2 would stop before entering the intersection and yield to him. This false assumption led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 had been driving vehicles for just six months and was unlicensed, which suggests a lack of experience and knowledge of traffic rules. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their false assumptions and failure to yield the right of way.
