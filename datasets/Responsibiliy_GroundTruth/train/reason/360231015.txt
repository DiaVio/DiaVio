The reason for this is that the driver of V2 lost control of the vehicle while negotiating a curve on the freeway on-ramp. This loss of control caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise and travel into the lane of Vehicle 1 (V1), the 2001 Nissan Sentra. The impact between V1 and V2 resulted in serious injuries to the driver of V1. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V2 for losing control of the vehicle and causing the collision.
