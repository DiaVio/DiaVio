The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 departed the right side of the road, overcompensated by steering left, and then departed the left side of the roadway. This indicates that the driver lost control of the vehicle, leading to the subsequent collision with the guardrail and the rollover. The driver's statement of not remembering anything after feeling the vehicle begin to rotate further suggests a lack of control and awareness. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver-related factor of overcompensation.
