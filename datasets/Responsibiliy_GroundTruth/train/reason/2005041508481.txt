The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front (V2) and was unable to stop in time to avoid rear-ending V2. This is evident from the driver's statement that he noticed traffic slowing in his lane and attempted to decelerate, but was unable to stop in time due to the abrupt halt of traffic. Additionally, the police reported travel speed of V1 was 89 kmph, indicating that V1 was traveling at a higher speed than the posted limit of 105 kmph. Furthermore, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was a recognition error and driver inattention, with associated factors of inexperience, emotional factors, and potential highway-related factors such as rush hour congestion and a nearby crash. These factors contribute to the driver's failure to react appropriately to the slowing traffic and maintain a safe distance. On the other hand, V2 (the Honda Pilot) is not primarily responsible for the accident. The driver of V2 was traveling at a lower speed of about 80 kmph and stopped in time to avoid a collision with the vehicle in front. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was another motor vehicle in the lane traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, indicating that V2 was not the cause of the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to maintain a safe distance, inability to stop in time, and various associated factors contributing to driver inattention and recognition errors.
