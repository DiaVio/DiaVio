The reason for V1's responsibility is driver inattention, specifically thinking about the driver's disability. The driver, who was recovering from recent back surgery and had hypertension, was not fully focused on the road and was testing his reflexes while driving. This lack of attention led to V1 driving off the right edge of the road and subsequently colliding with a concrete mile marker and a utility pole before coming to rest on the other side of the road. Additionally, the driver's inadequate or insufficient steering and braking contributed to the accident.
