The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 struck the back plane of Vehicle 3 with its frontal plane, indicating that it was not able to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle 3. Additionally, Vehicle 2 crossed over the center line of the roadway and into the northbound travel lane, which ultimately led to the collision with Vehicle 1.
