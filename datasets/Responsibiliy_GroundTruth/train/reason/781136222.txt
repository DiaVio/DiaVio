The reason for this is that V2 was traveling west out of a business driveway and attempted to turn left across the northbound number-one lane, placing it in the path of V1. V1, the minivan driven by the case subject, was already traveling in the northbound lane and had the right of way. V1 braked to avoid the collision, but was unable to avoid striking the left front of V2. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and make a safe left turn makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
