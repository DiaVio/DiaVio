The driver of V1 admitted to falling asleep at the wheel, which was the critical reason for the crash. This indicates a critical non-performance error on the part of the driver. Additionally, the driver's history of high blood pressure and medication use, which can cause fatigue and dizziness, may have contributed to his drowsiness. The fact that V1 drove off the right side of the roadway and struck a pole further supports the driver's claim of falling asleep.
