The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver made a false assumption of the actions of other vehicles. The driver assumed that there was no other traffic approaching eastbound when she began to make her left turn. This false assumption led to V1 entering the intersection and subsequently being struck by V2 (the Nissan Quest van). Additionally, it is mentioned that the sight line restriction created by the semi truck also contributed as an associated factor for both vehicles. However, V1's false assumption and decision to proceed with the left turn without ensuring the intersection was clear makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
