The reason for this is that the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "driver related factor: inadequate surveillance." This suggests that the driver of Vehicle One failed to adequately observe the intersection and failed to notice Vehicle Two approaching before entering the intersection. As a result, Vehicle Two collided with the right side of Vehicle One. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from crossing street, across path." This indicates that Vehicle Two was not at fault for the accident, as it was simply crossing the intersection when Vehicle One failed to yield the right of way. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance.
