The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was unable to maintain control of his vehicle due to traveling too fast for the conditions. This is supported by the fact that V1 was traveling in lane three, lost control after being hit from behind, and swerved into lane two where it collided with V2. The driver of V2 also stated that V1 was speeding. Additionally, the police on the scene did not believe V1's account of a hit and run, as there was no damage to the back of V1 and no white paint transfer. Therefore, V1's excessive speed and inability to maintain control of the vehicle are the main factors contributing to their responsibility for the crash.
