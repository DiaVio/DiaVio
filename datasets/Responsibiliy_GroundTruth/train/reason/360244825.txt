The reason for this is that V2 impacted the right rear of V1 (the 2006 Kia Optima), causing V1 to rotate and ultimately collide with a pole. V2's impact on V1 resulted in minor damage, while V1 sustained disabling damage and serious injuries to its driver. Therefore, V2's actions directly contributed to the more severe consequences of the crash.
