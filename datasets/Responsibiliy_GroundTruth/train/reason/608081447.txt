The reason for this is that V2 drifted off the west edge of the roadway, causing the right wheels to drop onto the shoulder. The driver of V2 then attempted to return to the roadway but over-corrected and lost control of the vehicle. This resulted in V2 entering a counterclockwise yaw and crossing the center-line, ultimately colliding with the case vehicle. Therefore, the actions of the driver of V2, specifically the failure to maintain control of the vehicle after drifting off the roadway, led to the collision and subsequent injuries to the driver of the case vehicle.
