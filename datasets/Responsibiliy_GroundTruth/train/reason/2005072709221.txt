The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. As V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet Blazer) came to a stop due to rush hour traffic congestion, V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and collided with the back of V2. This indicates that V1 was not able to react in time to the slowing or stopped vehicle ahead, suggesting that they were driving at an unsafe speed for the conditions. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and inability to respond to the actions of V2 makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
