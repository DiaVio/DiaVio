The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that she was attempting a left turn at an intersection, but failed to adequately check for oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 looked to the left before making the turn but did not see V2 (the driver of the Ford Ranger pick-up) approaching from that direction. This failure to properly survey the intersection and check for oncoming traffic is considered inadequate surveillance. Additionally, V1 ignored the posted "no left turn" sign, which is an illegal maneuver. This further contributes to her responsibility for the collision. It is important to note that V2's critical pre-crash event was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from driveway, turning into opposite direction." However, the critical reason for the collision was not coded to V2. This suggests that V2 was not at fault for the collision and that V1's actions were the primary cause.
