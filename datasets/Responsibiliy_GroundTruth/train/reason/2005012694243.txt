The driver of V1 admitted to crossing the centerline into the eastbound lane, stating that she was trying to avoid a non-contact vehicle that she believed was entering her lane. This action resulted in a collision with V2 (the 1993 Chevrolet Pickup). The critical reason for the critical event for V1 was inadequate evasive action. While V2 also mentioned a non-contact vehicle swerving in front of him, it is important to note that V2 was traveling in the correct lane and did not make any evasive maneuvers. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to crossing the centerline and failing to maintain control of their vehicle.
