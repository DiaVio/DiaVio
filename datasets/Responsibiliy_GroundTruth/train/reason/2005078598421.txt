The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. The driver of V1 stated that they stopped at the stop sign for 2-3 minutes, but failed to properly assess the traffic conditions before entering the intersection. This is supported by the critical reason coded as "recognition error-inadequate surveillance (e.g., failed to look, looked but did not see)." Additionally, the sight line was somewhat blocked by a large box truck turning right at the intersection, which may have contributed to the driver of V1 not being able to see oncoming traffic clearly. On the other hand, the driver of V2 (the 1993 Chevrolet pickup) was traveling straight on the through street and had the right of way. V2 was not assigned any critical reason for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly survey the intersection before making a left turn.
