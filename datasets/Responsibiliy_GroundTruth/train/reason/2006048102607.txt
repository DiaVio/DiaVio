The reason for this is that V2 changed lanes to the right, into lane one, just before entering the intersection. This action caused V2's front to contact V1's front, resulting in the collision. Additionally, V2 veered right and departed the roadway, indicating a failure to maintain control of the vehicle. Therefore, V2's lane change and failure to maintain control are the main factors that led to the accident, making V2 primarily responsible.
