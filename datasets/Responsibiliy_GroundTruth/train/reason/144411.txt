The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to drift to the right, causing the right side tires to leave the paved portion of the road. This resulted in V1 being pulled off the road by the deep ditch/downgrade. The driver's attempt to steer left further exacerbated the situation, leading to a counterclockwise yaw. Ultimately, V1 collided with a large tree, causing significant damage and coming to a rest against the tree. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and stay within the designated lane is the primary factor contributing to the accident.
