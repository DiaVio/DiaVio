The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was fatigued from a long day, which may have impaired his ability to react appropriately in the situation. - V1 was in need of brake maintenance and had a non-functioning headlamp, which could have affected the driver's ability to control the vehicle and properly assess the surroundings. - V1 veered right and lost traction, indicating a driver-related decision error of overcompensation, which suggests that the driver may have overcorrected the vehicle's path, leading to the collision with V2. Overall, the combination of driver fatigue, vehicle maintenance issues, and driver error in overcompensation points to V1 as primarily responsible for the collision.
