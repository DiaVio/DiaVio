The driver of V1 admitted to not being fully awake at the time of the crash and stated that she did not pay enough attention to the oncoming traffic. The critical reason for the critical event was coded as "inadequate surveillance," indicating that the driver failed to adequately observe the oncoming traffic before making a left turn. Additionally, the driver's fatigue was identified as an associated factor in the crash. On the other hand, V2 (the 2006 Ford E250) was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any critical reason coded for the critical event. The driver of V2 was familiar with the area and the vehicle, suggesting that they were driving responsibly. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's inadequate surveillance and fatigue.
