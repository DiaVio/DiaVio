Reason: The driver of V1 admitted to being upset due to a personal problem (an argument with her boyfriend) prior to the crash. This driver inattention, likely caused by emotional distress, led to V1 veering off the road and colliding with a pole. The absence of any evidence or witness accounts of a dog on the road suggests that the driver's claim of trying to avoid hitting a dog may not be truthful.
