The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding. Despite stopping at the intersection, the driver did not properly look left and right to ensure it was safe to proceed. This lack of surveillance resulted in the driver not detecting V2 (the 1997 Dodge Stratus) approaching the intersection. The fact that the driver was engaged in a conversation with the front passenger further distracted their attention from the road. Additionally, it is mentioned that this was the first time the driver had traveled this route, which may have contributed to their unfamiliarity with the intersection and potential lack of awareness. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Dodge Stratus) assumed that V1 would yield the right of way, which was an incorrect assumption. However, V2's assumption was based on the expectation that V1 would follow the traffic rules and yield at the stop sign. Therefore, while V2's assumption was incorrect, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for failing to properly surveil the intersection and proceed safely.
