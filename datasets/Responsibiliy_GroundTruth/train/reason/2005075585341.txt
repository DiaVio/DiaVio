The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to trying to run the red light and was in a hurry to get home to take a nap before going to work. This indicates a disregard for traffic laws and a lack of attention to the road. Additionally, the driver mentioned that a non-contact vehicle to his left had stopped for the light, blocking his view of Vehicle two (V2) approaching from his left. However, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure a clear view of the intersection before proceeding, regardless of any obstructions caused by other vehicles. The driver's fatigue may have also contributed to his inability to properly assess the situation and make safe decisions while driving.
