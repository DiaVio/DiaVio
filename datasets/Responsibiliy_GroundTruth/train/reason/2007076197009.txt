The reason for this is that V1 failed to negotiate the left curve in the road, indicating that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions. This is supported by the critical pre-crash event being coded as vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions, and the critical reason being coded as a driver-related factor of being too fast for the curve/turn. Additionally, the fact that the driver fled the scene and could not be contacted for an interview suggests a potential attempt to avoid responsibility.
