The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling in the westbound travel lane and intended to cross through the intersection. However, it failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, which was traveling in the right northbound through lane. As a result, the frontal plane of Vehicle 2 struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1 in a "t-bone" configuration. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and violated the right of way of Vehicle 2.
