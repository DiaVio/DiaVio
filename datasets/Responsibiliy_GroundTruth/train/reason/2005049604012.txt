The driver of V1 was in the left turn only lane but attempted to go straight instead of turning left. This was an illegal maneuver as indicated by the critical event driver related factor "illegal maneuver" (disregard turn marks at intersection). The driver admitted that he did not realize the lane next to him was also a left turn lane. There were multiple signs on the right side of the road as well as a sign on top of the traffic light indicating the permitted moving directions for each lane. If the driver had observed these signs prior to proceeding into the intersection, he would have known that vehicles in lane 2 do not all travel straight through the intersection at that location. Therefore, the driver of V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to his illegal maneuver and failure to observe the signs indicating the permitted movements for each lane.
