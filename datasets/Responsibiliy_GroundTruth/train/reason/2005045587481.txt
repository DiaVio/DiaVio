The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is as follows: - Vehicle #1 rear-ended Vehicle #2 (1993 Toyota Pickup) while it was decelerating in preparation to make a right turn. - Vehicle #1's driver admitted to being momentarily distracted and looking away from the road. - Vehicle #1's driver failed to adequately surveil the road ahead and made a false assumption about the actions of Vehicle #2. - Vehicle #1 was following too closely to be able to respond to the deceleration of Vehicle #2. - Vehicle #1's driver had limited driving experience, having obtained her license only two months prior. - The low pressure in the right rear tire of Vehicle #1 could have contributed to decreased stopping distance. - The roadways were wet, which may have affected the braking ability of Vehicle #1. Therefore, based on these factors, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
