The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to depart from the left shoulder and subsequently lost control, resulting in a collision with a cluster of trees. The driver's lack of restraint use, evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the available seat belt system, indicates a failure to take necessary precautions for safety. Additionally, the non-deployment of the seat belt's retractor pretensioner further supports the driver's negligence in using available safety measures. The driver's actions, including steering input that directed the vehicle towards the right shoulder and subsequent collision with the trees, ultimately led to the rollover event and serious injuries. The driver's failure to maintain control of the vehicle and utilize available safety features makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
