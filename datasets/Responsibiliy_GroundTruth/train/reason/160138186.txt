The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that it failed to negotiate the curve in the road, resulting in the front of V1 striking the rear of Vehicle two (V2), the 2003 Honda Element utility vehicle. This indicates that V1 was not able to maintain control and stay within its lane, leading to the collision.
