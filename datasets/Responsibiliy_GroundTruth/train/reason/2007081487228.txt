The reason for this is that V1 initiated a left turn in front of the stopped semi-truck and into the path of V2 (the driver of the Chevy Corsica). V1 failed to properly assess the situation and did not see V2 approaching, possibly due to the obstructed view caused by the semi-truck. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. Therefore, V1's failure to yield and turn with an obstructed view led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
