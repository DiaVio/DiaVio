The driver of V1 admitted that he did not see anyone approaching the intersection and proceeded through it while looking at his brother parked a block away. This indicates that V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before crossing, which is a driver-related factor. Additionally, the presence of parked vehicles and a large bush obstructing the sightline may have contributed to V1's failure to see the approaching V2. Therefore, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic make them primarily responsible for the collision.
