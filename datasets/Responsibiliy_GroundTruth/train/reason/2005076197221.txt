The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to maintain control of the vehicle in the poor road conditions caused by the hail-covered roadway. Despite the driver's attempt to avoid a collision with the sliding truck, the driver's actions of braking and steering resulted in a counter-clockwise rotation and loss of control. The driver's inability to regain control and prevent the vehicle from departing the road and overturning ultimately led to the crash.
