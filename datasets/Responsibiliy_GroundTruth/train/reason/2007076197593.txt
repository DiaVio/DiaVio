The driver of V1 stated that a vehicle traveling east passed a large truck in his lane, causing him to steer right to avoid a collision. However, passing in a no-passing zone is a violation of traffic laws and is considered negligent driving. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, which is an associative factor in the accident. While witness #2 confirmed that he passed the truck without crossing the yellow line, he also stated that V1 was traveling at a high speed of 112 kmph (70 mph). This excessive speed, combined with the driver's inexperience and overcompensation, likely contributed to the accident. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's violation of traffic laws, inexperience, and overcompensation.
