The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 attempted to pass V3 on the left for unknown reasons. V1 traveled into the oncoming southbound lanes, resulting in a head-on collision with V2, the 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche. This action by the driver of V1 caused the severe crash and subsequent chain reaction involving V3 and V4.
