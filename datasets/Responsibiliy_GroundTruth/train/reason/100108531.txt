The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver allowed the vehicle to gradually leave the right side of the roadway and travel over the curb. This led to a slight clockwise rotation as the vehicle traveled off the embankment and landed with significant force on its left front wheel/axle, causing severe damage and deploying the frontal impact airbags. The driver's fatigue and failure to maintain control of the vehicle ultimately resulted in the rollover crash.
