The critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from opposite direction - over right lane line." This indicates that V2 crossed over the right lane line, encroaching into the path of V1. On the other hand, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inattention." While V1 may have been inattentive, it was V2's action of encroaching into the opposite lane that directly led to the collision. Therefore, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain their lane and encroaching into the path of V1.
