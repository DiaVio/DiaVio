The reason for this is that V1 traveled over the center lane line, indicating a failure to maintain their lane. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by reaching for her ringing cell phone just prior to the crash. These actions demonstrate negligence and a lack of attention to the road, resulting in the collision with V2 (the 2006 Dodge Charger). While V2 (the driver of the Dodge Charger) noticed V1 traveling over the lane line, they were unable to avoid the collision due to surrounding traffic. However, V2's actions do not contribute to the primary cause of the crash, as the encroachment by V1 was the critical pre-crash event for V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their failure to maintain their lane and being distracted by their cell phone.
