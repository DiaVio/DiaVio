The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #1 was fatigued and inattentive, as indicated by the driver's lack of recollection of the crash, the limited amount of sleep he had prior to the incident, and the presence of alcohol in his system. The Critical Precrash Event of Vehicle #1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side suggests that the driver's inattention and fatigue caused him to veer off the road and ultimately collide with the utility pole. It is important to note that the road conditions were dry, the speed limit was within the legal range, and there were no reported issues with the vehicle itself. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle #1 due to his impaired state and lack of attention while operating the vehicle.
