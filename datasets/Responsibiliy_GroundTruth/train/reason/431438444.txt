The reason for this is that the non-contact vehicle's action of cutting off V1 caused it to swerve partially off the roadway and onto the right shoulder, leading to the subsequent collision with the concrete barrier. The non-contact vehicle's failure to yield or properly signal while changing lanes resulted in the chain of events that led to the crash.
