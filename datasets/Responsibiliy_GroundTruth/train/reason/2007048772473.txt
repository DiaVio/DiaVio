The reason for this is that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1 (the driver of the 2002 Buick LeSabre) while crossing the intersection. V2 stated that she did not see V1 prior to the crash, indicating a lack of attention or failure to properly observe the intersection. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from crossing street, across path," further suggesting that V2 was at fault for not properly yielding to oncoming traffic. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was not interviewed, so there is no further information available regarding their actions or potential contribution to the accident.
