The reason for V1's responsibility is that they turned left from the southbound lane into the eastbound turning lane, which is not the designated area for turning into the strip mall. V1 had an obstructed view and assumed that the vehicles traveling northbound would slow down or stop to allow them to complete the turn. However, V1 failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic and did not see V2 (the 2004 Dodge Caravan) until the last minute, resulting in the collision. V2, on the other hand, was traveling in the correct lane and did not have any critical reasons or associated factors that contributed to the accident. V2's statement aligns with the evidence that V1 cut in front of their vehicle, indicating that V2 was not at fault. In conclusion, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their improper turn and failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic.
