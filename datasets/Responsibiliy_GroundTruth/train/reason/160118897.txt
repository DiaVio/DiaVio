The reason for this is that V2 changed lanes to the right, pulling in front of V1. This action by V2 caused V1's driver to apply the foot brake in an attempt to stop, but ultimately resulted in V1 striking the rear of V2 with the front of V1. Therefore, V2's lane change without providing sufficient space or time for V1 to react and avoid the collision makes V2 primarily responsible for the accident.
