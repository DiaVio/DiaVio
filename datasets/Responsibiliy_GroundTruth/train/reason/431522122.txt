The driver of Vehicle 1 allowed the vehicle to enter the right shoulder and subsequently collided with a W-beam guardrail. This initial impact did not alter the vehicle's trajectory, but it caused moderate damage to Vehicle 1. As a result of this collision, Vehicle 1 was re-directed back into the westbound travel lanes and crossed the path of Vehicle 2, resulting in a collision between the front right areas of both vehicles. The impact with Vehicle 2 caused additional frontal damage to Vehicle 1 and compounded its clockwise rotation. Vehicle 1 then collided with the concrete barrier, resulting in moderate damage. Therefore, Vehicle 1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's actions that led to the initial collision with the guardrail and subsequent collisions with Vehicle 2 and the concrete barrier.
