The reason for this is that V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a left turn. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; inadequate surveillance (e.g. failed to look, looked but did not see)." This indicates that V1 did not properly check for oncoming traffic, including V2, before entering the intersection. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Escape) was not coded as the critical reason for the accident. While V2's failure to look to the side ahead was an associated factor in the crash, it does not absolve V1 of their responsibility for not properly surveilling the intersection. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to adequately look for oncoming traffic before making a left turn.
