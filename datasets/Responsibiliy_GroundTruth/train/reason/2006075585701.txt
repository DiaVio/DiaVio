The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is as follows: - V1 was driving in the opposite direction at the time of the crash, indicating that the driver was going the wrong way on the highway. - V1 crossed the double yellow lines and entered the southbound lanes, causing the collision with V2. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling: over the lane line on the left side of the travel lane," indicating that V1 was not staying within its designated lane. - The critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was attributed to driver-related factors, specifically inadequate surveillance. This suggests that the driver of V1 failed to properly observe and assess the traffic conditions before making the turn. - Additionally, the driver of V1 had a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .223, which is well above the legal limit in most jurisdictions. This impaired the driver's ability to operate the vehicle safely. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
