The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 was unable to negotiate the curved section of the roadway and keep the vehicle within its travel lane. As a result, Vehicle 1 entered the southbound travel lane and collided with Vehicle 2 (the 2003 Saturn Vue compact utility vehicle) in an offset frontal impact.
