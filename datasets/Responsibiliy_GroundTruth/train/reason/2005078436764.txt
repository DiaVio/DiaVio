The reason for V-1's responsibility is that V-1 struck the rear of V-2 while traveling at a speed between 48-56 kmph (30-35 mph), while V-2 was slowing down for a street sweeper. V-1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V-1 takes the medication Prozac, which may have contributed to her driving behavior or reaction time. Therefore, V-1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to following too closely and failing to react in a timely manner to the slowing vehicle in front.
