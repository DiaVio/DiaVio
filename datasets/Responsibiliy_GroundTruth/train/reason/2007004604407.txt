The reason for this is that V2 was traveling on the westbound roadway and failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was turning left at the intersection from the southbound roadway. V2 struck V1 on the left side, indicating that V2 did not have sufficient time or space to avoid the collision. Although V1 misjudged the speed and distance of V2, V2 had the right of way and should have been able to anticipate and avoid the collision by either slowing down or stopping. Additionally, V2's attempt to avoid the collision by applying brakes and steering right suggests that V2 was aware of the situation but failed to take appropriate action in a timely manner. Therefore, V2's failure to yield the right of way and inability to avoid the collision makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
