The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle due to overcompensation while trying to get back onto the roadway after the right side tires went off the road. This overcompensation led to V1 departing the roadway on the right side, striking a telephone pole, and subsequently spinning and striking a bridge abutment. Additionally, a witness at the scene stated that V1 was being operated in a careless manner and was traveling at a high rate of speed. Although the police reported travel speed for V1 is unknown, the witness's statement suggests that V1 may have been traveling too fast for the wet road conditions, which were an associated factor in the crash. Therefore, based on the driver's loss of control, overcompensation, and potential excessive speed, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
