The driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, ran off the left side of the road, and then overcorrected, causing V1 to enter into a counterclockwise rotation. This erratic maneuver ultimately led to V1 entering the right eastbound lane and colliding with Vehicle 2 (V2). Therefore, the actions of the driver of V1 were the main cause of the accident.
