The reason for this is that V1 struck the back of V2 (the 2006 Ford Econoline van) while it was stopped. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, which is a driver-related error. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane; other vehicle stopped," further suggesting that V1 was not paying attention to the road ahead. On the other hand, V2 was traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, but this alone does not make V2 primarily responsible for the accident. The driver of V2 stated that he did not see V1 prior to the crash, indicating that V1 may have been in his blind spot or that V1 approached too quickly for him to react. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and their driver-related error.
