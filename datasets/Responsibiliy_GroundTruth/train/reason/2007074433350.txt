The reason for this is that V2 was the vehicle that entered the intersection and made a left turn, failing to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver of V2 admitted to not seeing V1 until just before the crash, indicating a failure to properly look and assess the situation before making the turn. This lack of surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision with V1.
