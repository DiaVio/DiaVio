The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle for unknown reasons, resulting in V1 traveling off the road and impacting a tree. The subsequent rotation and impact with another tree further indicate that V1 was not under proper control at the time of the crash.
