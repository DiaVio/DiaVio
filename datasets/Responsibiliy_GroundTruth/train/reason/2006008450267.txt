The reason for this is that V1 attempted to change lanes into lane one without properly ensuring that it was safe to do so. This resulted in V1 striking V2 on its left side, causing V2 to go off the roadway and hit a guardrail. Additionally, V1 fled the scene of the accident, indicating a lack of responsibility and accountability for their actions. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was found to have a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.31, which is significantly above the legal limit for driving. This suggests that the driver of V1 was impaired at the time of the crash, further contributing to their responsibility for the accident.
