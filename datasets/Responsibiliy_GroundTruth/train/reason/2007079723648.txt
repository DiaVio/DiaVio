The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 abruptly changed lanes to the right in an attempt to avoid a collision with a non-contact vehicle. - The driver of V1 then applied the brakes and steered left, causing the vehicle to veer to the left and rotate counterclockwise. - V1 ultimately departed the roadway to the left and impacted the center divider twice. - The critical reason for the crash was coded as overcompensation, indicating that the driver's actions in response to the situation were excessive and led to the loss of control. - The driver's inexperience, with only one month of driving experience, likely contributed to the overcompensation. - Additionally, the driver admitted to traveling above the posted speed limit, further indicating a lack of caution and responsibility. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's overcompensation, inexperience, and speeding.
