The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - The driver of V1 was under the influence of alcohol, which impaired his ability to operate the vehicle safely. - The driver engaged in reckless behavior by attempting to show off the speed and quickness of his vehicle to the passenger. - The driver was traveling well above the posted speed limit and was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. - No avoidance maneuvers were attempted by the driver, indicating a lack of proper response to the situation. These factors, including alcohol impairment, reckless driving, and failure to control the vehicle, contribute to V1's primary responsibility for the crash.
