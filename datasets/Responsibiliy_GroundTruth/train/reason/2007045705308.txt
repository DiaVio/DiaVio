The reason for this is that V1 struck the rear of V2 (the 2004 Mitsubishi Outlander), causing V2 to collide with V3 (the hit and run vehicle). V1's driver stated that she was in the right lane and had just left a fast food place when she approached a green light. However, instead of the vehicle ahead of her moving, it stopped, and she collided with it. This indicates that V1's driver failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was "other vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," suggesting that V1's driver failed to react appropriately to the stopped vehicle ahead. The critical reason for V1 was coded as "other physical impairment of the ability to act," indicating that factors such as low blood sugar and the recent tooth extraction with pain medication may have impaired the driver's ability to respond effectively. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash.
