The reason for this is that V2 made a false assumption that V1 would stop, even though V1 had the right of way. V2 had a green left turn arrow, but failed to yield to oncoming traffic. This false assumption and failure to yield resulted in V2 turning left in front of V1, causing the collision. Additionally, V2 reported only 2.5 years of driving experience, most of which was in Brazil, indicating inexperience as a contributing factor.
