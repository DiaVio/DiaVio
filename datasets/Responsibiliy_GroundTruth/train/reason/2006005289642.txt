The driver of V1 stated that he came to a complete stop at the intersection and looked both ways before proceeding. However, the investigation revealed that there was no visual obstruction at the time of the crash. This indicates that the driver of V1 did not adequately survey the intersection before entering it, leading to the collision with V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance.
