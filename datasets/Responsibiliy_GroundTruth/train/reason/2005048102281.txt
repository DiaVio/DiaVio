The reason for this is that V1 was crossing through the intersection controlled by a stop sign and red flashing warning light, while V2 (the driver of the 1992 Peterbilt Conventional 379 tractor) had the right of way on the state highway with a yellow flashing warning light. V1 failed to yield to the oncoming traffic and pulled out in front of V2, resulting in the collision.
