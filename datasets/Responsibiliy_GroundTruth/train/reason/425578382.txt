The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 was traveling west on a rural road and while negotiating a left curve, it began to yaw counterclockwise and departed the road to the right. This loss of control resulted in a series of events where Vehicle 1 struck multiple objects, including bushes, trees, and a chain-link fence, ultimately leading to a rollover and severe damage to the vehicle.
