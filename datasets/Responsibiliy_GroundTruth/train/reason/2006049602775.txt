The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of V2 (2000 Cadillac Escalade) slowing down to turn right into the driveway. Additionally, V1 was speeding and the driver of V1 failed to look far enough ahead, which contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver-related factors of excessive speed and failure to anticipate and react to the actions of other vehicles on the road.
