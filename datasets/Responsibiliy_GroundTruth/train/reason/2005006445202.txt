The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through it. The driver of V2 admitted to not being able to see the crossing street due to a parked vehicle blocking their view. This recognition error and inadequate surveillance led to V2 entering the intersection without properly assessing the oncoming traffic. While V1 also had their view obstructed by the same parked vehicle, they were traveling on a one-way street with a stop sign visible approaching the intersection. V1's responsibility would have been to yield to any vehicles already in the intersection, which V2 was. Therefore, V2's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield to oncoming traffic makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
