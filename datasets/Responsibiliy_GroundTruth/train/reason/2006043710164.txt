The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn. Despite having a solid green light, V1 falsely assumed that V2 would stop for them. V1 did not recognize that they had to yield to oncoming traffic when making a left turn. Additionally, V1's unfamiliarity with the roadway and inattention due to a financial problem were contributing factors to the accident. V2 (the driver of the 1999 Ford F-250 pickup truck) had a solid green light and was driving straight ahead at the posted speed limit. V2 attempted to brake and steer right to avoid the collision, but was unable to stop in time. In summary, V1's failure to yield the right of way while making a left turn, along with their unfamiliarity with the roadway and inattention, makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
