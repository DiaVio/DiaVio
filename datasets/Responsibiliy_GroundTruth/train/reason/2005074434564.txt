The reason for this is that V1 experienced traction control loss due to icy conditions and reacted abruptly by braking and steering right. This caused V1 to depart from their travel lane, cross the center lane, and enter into the oncoming lane where the collision occurred with V2. While both drivers were affected by the severe weather conditions, V1's loss of control and subsequent actions directly led to the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1's critical pre-crash event was coded as vehicle control loss due to poor road conditions further supports their primary responsibility.
