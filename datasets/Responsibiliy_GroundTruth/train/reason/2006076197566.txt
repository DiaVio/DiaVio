The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 129 kmph (80 mph), which exceeds the speed limit of 105 kmph (65 mph). Additionally, V1 traveled off the right side of the roadway, indicating that the driver may have lost control of the vehicle. The driver then overcompensated by steering left, causing V1 to cross both lanes and ultimately crash into an embankment. The driver's medical condition and medication use may be factors to consider, but without confirmation from medical records, it cannot be definitively stated that these factors contributed to the crash. Therefore, the primary responsibility lies with V1 and its driver for exceeding the speed limit and losing control of the vehicle.
