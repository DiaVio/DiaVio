The reason for this is that V1 was attempting a left turn from the third lane, which is a left turn lane. V2 (the driver of the 2003 Jaguar S-Type) was traveling straight in the second lane, which indicates that V2 had the right of way. V1's false assumption of V2's actions, expecting V2 to yield the right-of-way, led to the collision. Additionally, there is no indication that V2 ran a red light or violated any traffic laws. The witness on the PAR indicated that V2 sped up when the light turned yellow, which suggests that V2 was trying to clear the intersection before the light turned red. Therefore, V1's false assumption and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
