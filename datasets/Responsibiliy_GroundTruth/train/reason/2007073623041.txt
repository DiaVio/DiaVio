The driver of V1 stated that traffic was stop and go, and he applied the brakes in an attempt to avoid the crash. However, the critical reason for the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "driver related factor; misjudgment of gap or other's speed." This suggests that the driver of V1 misjudged the gap or the speed of the vehicles in front of him, leading to the collision.
