The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn. Despite not having a clear view of oncoming traffic in lane one, V1 proceeded into the intersection based on the assumption that the two cars in lane two and three had stopped and waved him on. However, V1's view was obstructed, and he did not have a clear line of sight to see V2 approaching in lane one. This failure to properly assess the situation and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision. V1 was cited for causing the crash due to his failure to yield right of way.
