The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that she made a left turn across the path of V1 without adequately checking for oncoming traffic. V2 stated that she did not stop prior to initiating her turn and did not take the time to look for oncoming traffic. This decision error, combined with the obstructed view caused by the non-contact vehicle in the opposing left turn lane, led to the collision with V1. Therefore, V2's failure to properly assess the situation and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic makes her primarily responsible for the accident.
