The reason for this is that V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2. Although both drivers claimed to have a green light, it is more likely that V1 entered the intersection on a solid green light and did not yield to V2. It is possible that V1 had a green turn arrow initially, but it did not remain long enough for him to complete his turn.
