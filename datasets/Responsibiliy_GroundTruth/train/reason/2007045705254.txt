The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 entered the intersection under a red light, indicating a violation of traffic laws. - V1 was distracted by preparing to text someone, which is an internal distraction and a contributing factor to the accident. - V1 failed to look far enough ahead and failed to stop for a traffic control device, indicating a lack of attention and awareness. - V1 was also traveling too fast and did not realize caution was required, suggesting a failure to adjust speed according to the conditions. These factors collectively demonstrate that V1's actions and behaviors were the primary cause of the accident.
