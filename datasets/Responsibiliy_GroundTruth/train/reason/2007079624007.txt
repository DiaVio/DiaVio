The reason for this is that V1 was illegally parked along the west curb, blocking a driveway. When V1 merged onto the roadway from its parked position, it failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic, specifically V2 (the driver of the Chevrolet S-10 pickup). V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to look or see V2 before merging onto the roadway led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that the driver of V1 was in a hurry to keep up with his delivery schedule, which may have contributed to his failure to properly check for oncoming traffic. The driver's argument with a customer and the presence of high blood pressure and medication may also have affected his ability to focus and make safe driving decisions. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to illegal parking, inadequate surveillance, and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
