The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle traveling-crossing over the intersection, and the critical reason for V1 was inadequate surveillance. The driver of V1 stated that she did not detect V2 prior to impact and did not attempt any evasive maneuvers. Additionally, she mentioned feeling uncomfortable with the traffic density at the time of the crash. These factors indicate that V1 failed to properly observe and assess the situation before entering the intersection, leading to the collision with V2.
