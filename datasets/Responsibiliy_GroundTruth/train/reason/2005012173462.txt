The driver of V1 stated that she was driving at a speed of 101 Kph (60 mph) in lane 1 when the vehicle in front of her swerved to avoid a trash container in the roadway. She steered to the right but does not remember anything after that. The critical pre-crash event for this driver was coded as "This Vehicle Traveling - Off the Right Roadside" and the critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as "Poor Directional Control - e.g., failing to control vehicle with skill ordinarily expected." The driver's lack of control over the vehicle, as indicated by the critical reason for the pre-crash event, suggests that she failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle in response to the situation. Additionally, the driver being new to the area and having only driven this area of the interstate a couple of times could have contributed to her lack of familiarity with the road conditions and surroundings. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected.
