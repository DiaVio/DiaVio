The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it lost control and crossed the double yellow line, impacting the front bumper of Vehicle 2 (V2), the 1995 three-door Plymouth Voyager Minivan. V1's loss of control and crossing into the opposite lane caused the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 rotated counterclockwise after the initial impact, indicating that V1's actions contributed to the severity and outcome of the crash. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain control and stay within its lane makes it primarily responsible for the accident.
