The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle one failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making a right turn. This is evident from the driver's statement that he stopped at the stop sign but did not see Vehicle two approaching from the southbound direction. Additionally, the driver's over-familiarity with the roadway may have contributed to his failure to properly assess the situation. On the other hand, the driver of Vehicle two (the Freightliner Passenger Bus) was not at fault as she was traveling straight through the intersection and did not have a stop sign. She observed Vehicle one making the right turn without looking in her direction, indicating that she had the right of way. Therefore, Vehicle one is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
