The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to feeling fatigued and driving over the speed limit at the time of the crash. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle control loss due to traveling too fast for conditions," specifically too fast for the rain slick roadway. The driver's actions of driving while fatigued and exceeding the speed limit in wet conditions contributed to the loss of control and subsequent crash.
