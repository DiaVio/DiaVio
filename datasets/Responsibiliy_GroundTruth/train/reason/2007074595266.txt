The reason for this is that V1 turned left in the intersection and traveled off the right side of the road, ultimately striking three pedestrians and a wooden utility pole. The critical pre-crash event for V1 was coded as "this vehicle traveling off the edge of the road on the right side," indicating that the driver failed to maintain proper control of the vehicle. Additionally, the critical reason for the pre-crash event was coded as "driver related factor; poor directional control," further emphasizing the driver's failure to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's poor directional control and failure to maintain the vehicle within the roadway.
