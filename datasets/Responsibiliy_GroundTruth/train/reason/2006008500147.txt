The reason for V1's responsibility is that it lost traction and crossed the centerline of the roadway while negotiating the sharp curve. This indicates that V1 was traveling too fast for the wet conditions and the curve, which was the critical pre-crash event. The driver-related factor of traveling too fast for conditions, along with the wet roadway and heavy rain, were associated factors coded to V1. On the other hand, V2 (the 2003 Jeep Liberty SUV) was not primarily responsible for the crash. The critical pre-crash event for V2 was the encroachment of V1 into its lane, which was caused by V1's loss of control. The critical reason for V2 was not coded, indicating that V2 did not contribute significantly to the crash. The wet roadway and heavy rain were associated factors coded to V2, but no other factors could be determined as V2's driver could not be interviewed.
