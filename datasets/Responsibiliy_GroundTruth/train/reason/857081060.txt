The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 2 failed to negotiate the curve and departed the roadway to the right, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise and cross the center line. This action ultimately led to the collision with Vehicle 1 (2004 Mini Cooper S 2-door hatchback) in the southbound travel lane. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 2's failure to maintain control of their vehicle and stay within their lane resulted in the collision.
