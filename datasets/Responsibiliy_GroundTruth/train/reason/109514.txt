The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to ensure that the eastbound traffic had completely cleared before attempting to turn left into the gas station. This resulted in V1 crossing the path of V3, causing a collision. Additionally, V1's failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the subsequent collision with V2. Therefore, V1's actions of turning left without ensuring a clear path of travel make them primarily responsible for the accident.
