The driver of V1 swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid another merging vehicle, but in doing so, she sideswiped V2 (the 2003 Honda Accord) in the second lane. This indicates that V1 made an incorrect evasive action by overcompensating and steering into the adjacent lane where V2 was located. Additionally, the driver of V1 did not adequately survey to see if the lane V2 was in was clear to turn into. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to her incorrect evasive action and failure to properly assess the situation before making the maneuver.
