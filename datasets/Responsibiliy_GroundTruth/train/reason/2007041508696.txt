The reason for this is that V1 was backing out onto the roadway from a front yard, and V2 (the 1996 Honda Accord) was already traveling in the westbound lane. V1 failed to adequately surveil the road and did not see V2 before backing out. This indicates a driver-related recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1's statement that he believed the other driver had moved to the left lane to allow him to back out onto the roadway is not supported by the evidence. The driver of V2 did not have sufficient time or distance to avoid the collision, indicating that V1 pulled out in front of V2 without giving the other driver enough time to react. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to properly surveil the road and yield to oncoming traffic.
