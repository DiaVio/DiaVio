The reason for this is that Vehicle 2 was traveling northbound in the left northbound travel lane and struck the left side plane of Vehicle 1 (2008 Toyota Corolla) as it entered the intersection. This indicates that Vehicle 2 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 1, which was already in the intersection and intending to turn left.
