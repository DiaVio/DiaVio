The driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn, which is coded as a driver-related factor of inadequate surveillance. Additionally, the driver of V1 had only been a licensed driver for one week, had no formal driver training, and was driving on an unfamiliar roadway. These factors contribute to the driver's inexperience and unfamiliarity with the vehicle, which further supports their primary responsibility for the accident.
