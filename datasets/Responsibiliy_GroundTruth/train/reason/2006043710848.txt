The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a false assumption about V2's actions based on the right turn signal being on. V1 incorrectly assumed that V2 was turning right onto the on-ramp and proceeded to make a left turn in front of V2. This false assumption led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that V1 had loud music playing in the car, which could have caused a distraction and potentially contributed to the driver misjudging the velocity of V2. Overall, V1's false assumption and potential distraction from loud music are the main factors that make them primarily responsible for the accident.
