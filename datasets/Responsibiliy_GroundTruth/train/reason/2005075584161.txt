The reason for V1 being primarily responsible is as follows: - V1 was driving aggressively by attempting to pass another vehicle by crossing the double yellow lines, which is a violation of traffic laws. - V1 lost control of the vehicle while attempting to re-enter the southbound lane, resulting in the vehicle rotating and running off the road. - The driver's admission of drinking prior to the crash suggests impaired judgment and potentially impaired driving ability. - The police reported travel speed of 72 kmph for V1 indicates that the vehicle was exceeding the posted speed limit of 89 kph (55 mph), further contributing to the driver's inability to maintain control. Overall, V1's aggressive driving behavior, impaired judgment, and excessive speed are the primary factors that led to the accident.
