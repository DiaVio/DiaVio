The reason for assigning primary responsibility to Vehicle 1 is that it was involved in a severe frontal impact, resulting in significant damage to the front of the vehicle. The frontal offset and counterclockwise rotation of the vehicle indicate that Vehicle 1 was likely at fault for causing the collision. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the passenger, including traumatic brain injury, facial fractures, and fractures in the upper and lower extremities, were all attributed to striking against the center instrument panel, which had significant intrusion. This further supports the conclusion that Vehicle 1, in which the passenger was seated, was primarily responsible for the accident.
