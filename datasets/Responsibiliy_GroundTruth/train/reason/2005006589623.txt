The reason for this is that V1 violated a traffic control device by making an illegal maneuver. Although V1 claimed that V2 disregarded the red light, the police report contradicts this statement. Additionally, V1's refusal to be interviewed and provide further information suggests a lack of cooperation. Therefore, V1's failure to adhere to the traffic control device and the lack of evidence supporting their claim make them primarily responsible for the accident.
