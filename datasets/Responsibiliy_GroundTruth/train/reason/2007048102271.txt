The reason for this is that V1 was distracted by reaching into the console to find a piece of gum, which is considered an internal distraction. As a result, V1 failed to notice that V2 was decelerating in front of them, leading to the collision between V1 and V2. V1's failure to maintain proper attention and control of their vehicle contributed to the accident. It is important for drivers to prioritize their attention on the road and avoid distractions, such as reaching for objects inside the vehicle, to prevent accidents like this from occurring.
