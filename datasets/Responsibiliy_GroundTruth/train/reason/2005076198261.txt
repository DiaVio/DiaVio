The driver of V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and did not yield the right of way to V2 (the driver of the Chrysler Town & Country minivan). Additionally, the driver of V1 was driving at a high rate of speed, above the posted speed limit, and in an aggressive manner. The driver's medical conditions, including macular degeneration, may have impaired their ability to recognize the stop sign and the approaching V2. The driver also admitted to smoking methamphetamine earlier in the morning, which likely contributed to their impaired judgment and driving performance. The driver's fatigue from lack of sleep and the influence of prescription medications further compromised their ability to maintain proper vehicle control.
