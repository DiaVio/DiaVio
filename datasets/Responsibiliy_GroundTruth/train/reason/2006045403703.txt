The reason for this is that V1 was driving on the wrong side of the roadway with a flat tire, indicating a lack of attention and disregard for traffic laws. Additionally, the driver of V1 was under the influence of multiple drugs and alcohol, impairing her ability to safely operate the vehicle. The fact that V1 departed the roadway and struck a utility pole further supports the conclusion that the driver's impaired state contributed to the crash.
