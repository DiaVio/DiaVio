The reason for this is that the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at some children on his right, which caused him to take his attention away from his driving. This distraction led to V1 driving off the right side of the road and ultimately colliding with a pole. Additionally, the driver's inability to steer left and the presence of narrow roadway and excessive roadway lip/drop were contributing factors to the crash.
