The reason for this is that V1's front impacted with the rear of V2 (the 2005 Dodge Magnum SUV), which then pushed V2's front into the rear of V3 (the 1999 Chevrolet Lumina sedan). This indicates that V1 was following too closely and failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front, resulting in the chain reaction collision. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by looking at a soda can in the center console area, which further supports their responsibility for the accident.
