The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 rear-ended Vehicle #1, indicating that Vehicle #2 failed to maintain a safe following distance and was unable to stop in time. The driver of Vehicle #2 stated that Vehicle #1 suddenly stopped, but it is the responsibility of the following driver to maintain a safe distance and be prepared to stop if necessary, especially in wet road conditions. The driver of Vehicle #2 also made a decision error by traveling too fast to be able to respond to unexpected actions of others. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to maintain a safe following distance and their decision error of traveling too fast.
