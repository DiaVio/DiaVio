The reason for this is that V2 was partially on the road, in the eastbound lane, and had been stopped for several minutes prior to V1 approaching. When V2 attempted to accelerate back onto the road and return to the westbound lane, it collided with the front of V1. This indicates that V2 was not yielding the right of way to V1 and failed to properly assess the oncoming traffic before re-entering the road.
