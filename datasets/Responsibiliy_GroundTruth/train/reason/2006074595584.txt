The reason for this is that V1 changed lanes to the left and entered the intersection on a red light, disregarding the traffic signal. This illegal maneuver led to the collision with V2 (the 1998 Honda Accord sedan) which was traveling north in the intersection. Additionally, the driver of V1 was inexperienced, having only five months of driving experience, and was distracted by passengers giving directions and yelling at the driver for being in the wrong lane. These factors likely contributed to the driver's disregard for the traffic signal and ultimately led to the accident.
