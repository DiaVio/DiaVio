The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was aware of the poor condition of the vehicle's brakes and had planned to conduct repairs. The inspection of V1 revealed that the front brake rotors were glazed and/or grooved and in need of replacement. Additionally, a new brake rotor was found in the front floor pan, indicating that the driver was aware of the brake problem before taking the vehicle on this trip. The driver reported feeling no pressure when applying the brakes, which led to the perception of brake failure. As a result, the driver departed the road to the right instead of driving further down the road into an intersection. Despite the driver's denial of any diabetic-related illness at the time of the collision, it is important to note that the critical reason for the precrash event was attributed to V1 as a vehicle-related factor - brakes failed. Therefore, based on the driver's knowledge of the brake problem, the actual brake failure, and the resulting loss of control leading to the collision, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
