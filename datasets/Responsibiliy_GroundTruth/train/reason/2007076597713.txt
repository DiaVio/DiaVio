The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver was traveling too fast for the conditions of the dark roadway, despite being aware of the warning sign for animals on the roadway. The driver failed to reduce their speed and did not adequately surveil the road ahead, resulting in a collision with the elk. Additionally, the driver's statement that they were looking straight ahead but still did not see the animal in time suggests a lack of attentiveness and awareness while driving.
