The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection without yielding the right of way to V2. This is evident from the fact that V1 was cited for disregarding the traffic control sign. V2, on the other hand, was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Therefore, V1's failure to obey the traffic control device and yield to oncoming traffic resulted in the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
