The driver of V1 made an unsafe lane change into lane one, which was already occupied by another vehicle. When she noticed the approaching vehicle in lane one, she overcompensated by jerking the wheel sharply to the left, causing V1 to lose control and overturn onto its roof. The police reported travel speed of V1 was 105 kmph, which was too fast for the driver to maneuver safely. Therefore, V1's unsafe lane change, overcompensation, and high speed were the primary factors that led to the crash.
