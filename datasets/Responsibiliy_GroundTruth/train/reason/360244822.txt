The reason for this is that V1 departed the roadway to the right, traveled off the roadway, and struck a culvert and asphalt driveway. V1 then continued south through the grass and impacted a tree, resulting in the deployment of the driver's frontal impact airbag and actuation of the left front seat belt retractor pretensioner. V1 subsequently rolled over and came to rest on its roof. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, veered off the roadway, and ultimately collided with various objects before rolling over. The driver's serious injuries further indicate that V1 was the primary vehicle involved in the accident.
