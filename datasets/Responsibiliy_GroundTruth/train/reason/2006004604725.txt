The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was attempting to turn left onto the north/south roadway from the driveway. - V1 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before making the turn, despite looking both ways. - V1 was distracted and inattentive due to being in urgent need of a restroom, feeling tired, and engaging in conversation with the passenger. - V1 did not take any avoidance maneuver to prevent the collision with V2. - The critical pre-crash event for V1 was turning left at the intersection, and the critical reason was inadequate surveillance. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and make a safe left turn, combined with the driver's distractions and physical condition, make them primarily responsible for the accident.
