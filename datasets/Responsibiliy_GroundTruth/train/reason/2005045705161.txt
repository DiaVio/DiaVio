The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 swerved to the left, crossing the center lane and striking the right front of Vehicle #1 with the left rear of Vehicle #2. This indicates that Vehicle #2 initiated the collision by making an abrupt and unsafe maneuver. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle #2 stated that the vehicle in front of her appeared to stop suddenly, causing her to swerve hard left and hit Vehicle #1. However, this explanation does not absolve her of responsibility, as drivers are expected to maintain a safe following distance and be prepared to react to sudden changes in traffic conditions. Furthermore, the Critical Precrash Event for Vehicle #2 was that it crossed its lane line on the left side, and the Critical Reason for this event was overcompensation. This suggests that the driver of Vehicle #2 may have overreacted to the perceived hazard, leading to the collision. In contrast, the driver of Vehicle #1 stated that he was traveling in the left lane and began to brake and steer left when he saw Vehicle #2 swerve across traffic and strike him. This indicates that he was reacting to the actions of Vehicle #2 and was not the primary cause of the collision. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to their unsafe maneuver and overcompensation.
