The reason for this is that V2, the 2004 Mazda M3, made an illegal maneuver by running a red light and deliberately not looking at the signal before making the left turn. The driver admitted to assuming that the light stayed green and failed to look again. This lack of surveillance and failure to obey the traffic control device led to the collision with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 was also distracted by following another vehicle from the parking lot into the intersection.
