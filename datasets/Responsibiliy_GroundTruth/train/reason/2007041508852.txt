The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle while trying to avoid a non-contact vehicle that was changing lanes into V1's path. The driver of V1 stated that he had to steer sharply to the left to avoid getting hit and then overcorrected by steering sharply to the right, causing the vehicle to fishtail out of control and ultimately collide with the concrete barrier multiple times. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's overcompensation and loss of control of the vehicle.
