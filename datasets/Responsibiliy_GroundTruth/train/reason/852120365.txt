The reason for this is that V1 was the vehicle that went off the roadway, crossed both travel lanes, and ultimately collided with a tree. The description of the tire marks and the trajectory of the vehicle indicate that V1 lost control and veered off the road, causing the subsequent collision. Additionally, the severe extent of the damage and passenger compartment intrusion suggest that V1 was traveling at a high speed or with significant force at the time of impact. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
