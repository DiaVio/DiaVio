The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 became distracted by the left rear occupant, causing them to lose control of the vehicle. This distraction led to Vehicle 1 crossing over into the eastbound travel lane and colliding with Vehicle 2 in a head-on configuration. Therefore, the driver of Vehicle 1 bears the primary responsibility for the accident.
