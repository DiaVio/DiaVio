The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V1 stated that she looked both ways but did not see V2, indicating a failure to properly assess the oncoming traffic before making the turn. Additionally, V1 was distracted by eating while driving and thinking about a future event, which contributed to her inattention and inability to notice V2 approaching. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 2002 Oldsmobile Alero) was traveling straight on the through street and had the right of way. V2 stated that V1 just came out into the intersection following a non-contact vehicle, suggesting that V1 failed to yield and encroached into V2's path. Therefore, based on the information provided, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to her failure to yield, inattention, and distraction while making the left turn.
