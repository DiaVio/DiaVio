The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that they made a left turn at the stop sign without adequately surveilling the intersection. V1 stated that they looked both ways but did not see V2 approaching. This indicates a recognition error and inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. Additionally, V1 mentioned that their windshield and windows were foggy, which may have contributed to the crash. While weather conditions were rainy, V1's view obstruction related to condensation build-up on the interior glazing suggests that they did not take appropriate measures to ensure clear visibility before making the left turn. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the Ford Aerostar minivan) was traveling in the right lane and had the right of way. V2 stated that they saw V1 sticking out of the intersection and attempted to avoid the collision by locking up the brakes, but were unable to do so. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their recognition error, inadequate surveillance, and view obstruction related to condensation build-up on the interior glazing.
