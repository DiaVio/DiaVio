The reason for this is that the driver was traveling at a speed of 89 kmph, which was above the speed limit of 72 kmph. Additionally, the driver stated that she steered left to avoid a deer, indicating that she overcompensated for the presence of the animal in the roadway. The police report and physical evidence also support the conclusion that the driver was traveling too fast for the curves in the roadway.
