The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver ran a red light, which is an illegal maneuver. This action directly caused the collision with V2 (the 2006 Nissan Murano) as V2 was attempting to make a left turn through the intersection. V1's failure to stop at the red light and their inability to see V2 due to the dark color of the vehicle further supports their responsibility for the accident.
