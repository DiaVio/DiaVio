The driver of Vehicle 1 was unrestrained, which is evidenced by the absence of loading marks on the seat belt system. This lack of restraint use indicates a failure to take necessary precautions for safety. Additionally, the driver of Vehicle 1 initiated a forward trajectory in response to the impact force, indicating a lack of control or inability to properly navigate the road. Furthermore, the presence of loose cargo in the trunk of Vehicle 1, which penetrated the interior passenger compartment, could have contributed to the driver's injuries and potentially affected the occupant kinematic response. Overall, the combination of the driver's lack of restraint use, inability to maintain control, and the presence of loose cargo in the vehicle suggests that Vehicle 1 and its driver are primarily responsible for the accident.
