The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver admitted to being engaged in a walkie-talkie conversation at the time of the accident, indicating a recognition error of inadequate surveillance. This distraction likely contributed to the driver's failure to properly observe and react to the intersection and the presence of V2 (the 1996 Toyota Camry sedan). Additionally, V1 estimated their travel and impact speeds to be higher than V2, suggesting that V1 may have been traveling at an unsafe speed for the conditions. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1996 Toyota Camry sedan) claimed to have a green light and had a chance to brake, but was unable to avoid the collision due to disabled steering and braking systems after the impact. While V2 may have had some contributing factors such as chronic pain, diabetes, and corrective lenses for nearsightedness, no critical reason was coded to this driver, indicating that their actions did not significantly contribute to the accident. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident due to a recognition error of inadequate surveillance and possible distraction from a walkie-talkie conversation.
