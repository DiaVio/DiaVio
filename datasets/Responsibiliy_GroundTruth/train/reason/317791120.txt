The reason for this is that the severe head-on collision occurred between V1, the 2008 Chevrolet Aveo four-door sedan driven by the 69-year-old female, and V2. The principal direction of force was 12 o'clock, indicating that V2 was likely traveling in the wrong direction or crossed into the lane of V1, causing the head-on collision. Additionally, the injuries sustained by the driver of V1, including the subarachnoid hemorrhage, cord contusion with dislocation, bilateral flail chest and hemothoraces, liver laceration, and fractures, were attributed to the impact with the steering wheel via the airbag, indicating that V2's actions were the primary cause of these injuries.
