The reason for this is that V2 failed to stop for the stop sign at the intersection, which is a clear violation of traffic rules. This failure to stop resulted in V2 entering the intersection and colliding with V1, which was already in the intersection and had the right of way. Additionally, the Critical Reason for V2 was coded as unknown driver error, indicating that there was some error or mistake made by the driver of V2 that led to the accident. The associated factors of failure to stop for a traffic control device and driver inexperience further support the conclusion that V2 is primarily responsible for the accident. It is important to note that the driver of V1 did not contribute to the crash and was not at fault.
