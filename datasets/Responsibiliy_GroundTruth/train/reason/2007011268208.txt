The reason for this is that V1 was traveling at a speed of 121 kmph (75 mph), which exceeds the posted speed limit of 113 kmph (70 mph). Additionally, V1 was following too closely behind the pick-up truck, which resulted in the driver being unable to respond to the sudden braking of the pick-up truck. Furthermore, V1's actions after swerving onto the paved shoulder and into the grassy median, fishtailing, and overcorrecting contributed to the loss of control of the vehicle and its subsequent collision with V2 (the semi truck). Therefore, V1's excessive speed, failure to maintain a safe following distance, and improper control of the vehicle make them primarily responsible for the accident.
