The reason for this is that the driver of V1 took his eyes off the road to check traffic in the lane to his left, and when he looked back forward, traffic had come to a sudden stop. Despite traveling at the posted speed limit, the driver of V1 was unable to respond to the unexpected action of traffic stopping in his lane. This indicates that the driver of V1 was not maintaining a safe following distance and was driving too fast to be able to respond to the unexpected actions of other road users.
