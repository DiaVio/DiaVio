The reason for this is that V1 drifted right onto the roadside, contacted a pothole, and then attempted to maneuver back onto the roadway. However, V1 crossed both lanes and departed the roadway onto the left roadside, ultimately contacting an embankment and rolling over. This sequence of events suggests that the driver of V1 lost control of the vehicle, leading to the accident.
