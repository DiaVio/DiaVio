The reason for this is that V1 departed the road to the left for unknown reasons, which indicates a driver-related error. The critical pre-event movement of V1 being off the edge of the road on the left side further supports this. Additionally, the police report mentions an unknown illness, which could have been a contributing factor to the driver's error. The construction zone may have also been an associative factor, but ultimately, the driver's actions and condition are the main factors leading to the crash.
