The driver of V1 admitted that she could not see approaching traffic beyond the stopped vehicles and turned left with an obstructed view. This decision error, combined with the sightline restriction of her vehicle, led to the collision with V2. While V2 (the Toyota Avalon) did have the presence of a sightline restriction and was unable to stop in time, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for making a left turn without a clear view of approaching traffic.
