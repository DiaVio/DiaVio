The reason for this is that V2 was traveling at the posted speed limit of 56kmph (35mph) on the two-lane roadway, while V1 was traveling at a significantly slower speed of 8kmph (5mph) and had come to a stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. V2 crashed into the left side of V1 as it entered the intersection, indicating that V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1. Additionally, both drivers had a sightline restriction due to shrubbery obscuring their view of oncoming traffic, but V2 should have been more cautious and aware of the potential hazards when approaching the intersection.
