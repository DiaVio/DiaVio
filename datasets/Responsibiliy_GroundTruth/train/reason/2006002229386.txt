The reason for this is that Vehicle #2 was traveling at a higher speed and failed to stop or avoid colliding with Vehicle #1, which was stopped in the roadway waiting to make a left turn. Additionally, a witness at the scene reported that Vehicle #2 had proceeded through a red light before hitting Vehicle #1. Furthermore, the driver of Vehicle #2 was found to be driving while intoxicated and had inadequate brakes, which further contributed to the crash. Therefore, Vehicle #2 is primarily responsible for the crash due to its higher speed, failure to stop or avoid the collision, and the driver's impaired state and inadequate brakes.
