The reason for this is that V1 was driving at a high rate of speed, racing another vehicle, and lost control, resulting in the vehicle departing the roadway and causing damage to property. The driver's claim of another vehicle running through the intersection and causing him to lose control was deemed unbelievable based on witness accounts and the dynamics of the crash. Additionally, V1 was cited for careless driving, further indicating their responsibility for the accident.
