The reason for this is that V2 was traveling in the first lane and V1 was stopped in the driveway. V1 then turned left from the driveway, causing the front of V1 to impact the front of V2. This indicates that V2 had the right of way and V1 failed to yield to oncoming traffic. Additionally, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other vehicle encroachment; from driveway, turning into opposite direction," further supporting the notion that V2 was not at fault. It is important to note that the driver of V2 was taking medication, but there is no information to suggest that this directly contributed to the accident. Therefore, based on the given information, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to V1's failure to yield.
