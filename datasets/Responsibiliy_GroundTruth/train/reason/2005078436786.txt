The reason for this is that the driver of V2 made a false assumption about the actions of the driver of V1. The driver of V2 assumed that the driver of V1 was going to stop at the intersection, which led to V2 entering the intersection and subsequently colliding with V1. Additionally, the driver of V2 was attempting to make a right turn from the wrong travel lane, further contributing to the accident.
