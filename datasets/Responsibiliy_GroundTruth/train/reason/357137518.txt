The reason for this is that V2 was traveling westbound in the through lane of the intersecting three-lane road, while the case vehicle, a 2007 Chevrolet HHR station wagon, was northbound on the wet, level two-lane asphalt road approaching the intersection. V2 crossed the path of the case vehicle and struck its right fender and right-front door, causing both vehicles to rotate counterclockwise. This indicates that V2 failed to yield the right of way to the case vehicle, resulting in the collision.
