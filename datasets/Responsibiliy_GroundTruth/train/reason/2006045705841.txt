The reason for Vehicle #1's primary responsibility is that the driver was believed to be unconscious at the time of the crash due to a pre-existing medical condition and a change in medication. The critical precrash event for Vehicle #1 was the driver's physical impairment, specifically a heart attack or other physical impairment that affected their ability to act. No other contributing factors were coded to this vehicle. Vehicle #2 (2003 Mazda Protégé) was slowing down for the traffic signal that had changed from green to yellow, indicating a need to stop. The critical precrash event for Vehicle #2 was another motor vehicle in the same lane traveling at a higher speed. However, Vehicle #2 was not coded as having contributed to the crash. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle #1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's unconsciousness caused by a medical condition.
