The driver of V1 made a false assumption about the actions of other drivers and incorrectly assumed that cross traffic would yield to her as she entered the intersection. Additionally, the strong winds caused the traffic signal to move, leading the driver of V1 to falsely believe that she had a green light. These factors contributed to her decision to travel across the intersection, resulting in the collision with V2.
