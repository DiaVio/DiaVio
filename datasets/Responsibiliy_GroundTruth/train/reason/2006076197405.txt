The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, and according to the traffic control lights, left turns are required to yield to right-of-way traffic. V1 turned left immediately after another vehicle turned, without ensuring that it was safe to do so. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of the driver of V1. Additionally, the driver of V1 stated that he did not see V2, which suggests a failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic. The driver of V1 also mentioned that the rising sun and the color of the other vehicle may have obscured his view of V2, but it is still the responsibility of the driver to ensure a safe turn. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to right-of-way traffic.
