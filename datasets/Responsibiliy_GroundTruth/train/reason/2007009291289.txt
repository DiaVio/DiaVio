The reason for this is that the police reported inattention and traveling too fast for conditions as contributing factors. It is highly possible that the driver of V1 was traveling too fast to negotiate the ninety-degree left turn in the road, which led to the loss of control of the vehicle. The fact that V1 went off the road on the right side, struck railroad ties, a white fence, and multiple trees indicates that the driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle. Additionally, the driver fleeing the scene further suggests their responsibility for the accident.
