The reason for this is that V2 swerved quickly into lane two without properly checking for other vehicles, cutting off V1 (the Ford Taurus). This sudden lane change by V2 caused V1 to take evasive action, resulting in V1 losing control and ultimately rolling over. Additionally, V2's failure to properly check blind spots and ensure it was safe to change lanes demonstrates negligence on their part. V2's actions directly led to the critical pre-crash event of V1 traveling off the edge of the road on the left side. Therefore, V2's failure to exercise caution and properly check for other vehicles makes them primarily responsible for the accident.
