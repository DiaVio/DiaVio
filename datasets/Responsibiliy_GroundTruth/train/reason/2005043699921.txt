The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver failed to control the vehicle with the skill ordinarily expected. This is evident from the driver's sharp steering left and overcompensation to the right, resulting in the vehicle rotating and ultimately colliding with trees off the roadway. The driver's statement that she noticed the garbage can at the last second and lost control while attempting to avoid it further supports the conclusion that V1's driver was unable to maintain control of the vehicle in a safe manner.
