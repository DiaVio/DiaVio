The reason for this is that Vehicle 1, driven by the 26-year old male driver, struck the left side plane of Vehicle 2 (the 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche) while both vehicles were entering the intersection at the same time. This indicates that Vehicle 1 failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle 2, resulting in the collision.
