The driver of Vehicle #1 rear-ended Vehicle #2, which then pushed Vehicle #2 into the rear of Vehicle #3. The driver of Vehicle #1 was charged with following too closely and not having a driver's license. The critical reason for the critical event for Vehicle #1 was inattention, specifically a recognition error. The driver was fatigued, failed to look far enough ahead, and was unfamiliar with the roadway. These factors, combined with the traffic flow interruption factor of congestion, contributed to the driver's inattention and subsequent rear-end collision.
