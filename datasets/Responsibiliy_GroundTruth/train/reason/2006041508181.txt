The reason for this is that V1 made a left turn without adequately checking for oncoming traffic. The driver's view was completely obstructed by the parked semi-trailer, which was a traffic flow interruption. Even if the driver had looked in the required direction, they would not have been able to see the approaching vehicle. This indicates inadequate surveillance on the part of V1. On the other hand, V2 (the Ford Expedition driver) also had some associated factors that contributed to the accident, such as an internal distraction (possibly eating lunch) and panicking when she saw V1 pulling out. However, the primary responsibility lies with V1 due to their failure to properly check for oncoming traffic before making the left turn.
