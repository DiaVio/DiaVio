The reason for this is that Vehicle One entered the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically Vehicle Two (1996 Chrysler Cirrus), which was already in the intersection. This is evident from the critical pre-crash event coded for Vehicle One, which states that it was traveling and crossing over the intersection. Although the presence of a large SUV to the right of Vehicle One may have played a role, it is ultimately the responsibility of the driver of Vehicle One to ensure that it is safe to proceed into the intersection. The driver of Vehicle One failed to do so, resulting in the collision with Vehicle Two. It is important to note that the driver of Vehicle Two took evasive action by applying the brakes and decelerating, indicating an attempt to avoid the collision. However, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of Vehicle One for failing to yield the right of way.
