The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted by looking down at a book on the passenger seat and not slowing down when she saw the vehicles starting to move. This indicates a lack of attention and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicles' speed, which led to the collision. Additionally, it is mentioned that all four tires on V1 were underinflated, which could have affected the vehicle's braking and handling capabilities.
