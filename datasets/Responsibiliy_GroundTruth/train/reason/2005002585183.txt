The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle #2 admitted to being distracted by showing his girlfriend the trees in the area and looking to the right at times. He stated that he saw Vehicle #1 stopped in the roadway too late and tried to stop but didn't have enough time. This indicates that the driver of Vehicle #2 was not paying proper attention to the road and failed to react in a timely manner to the stopped vehicle ahead. Additionally, the Critical Precrash Event coded to Vehicle #2 was "other motor vehicle in lane, other vehicle stopped," and the Critical Reason for the Critical Precrash Event was coded as "external distraction." This further supports the conclusion that the driver of Vehicle #2 was distracted and not fully focused on the road. It should be noted that the driver of Vehicle #1 was stopped, waiting for oncoming traffic to clear before making a left turn, and was not thought to have contributed to the crash.
