The reason for V2 being primarily responsible is that the driver of V2 failed to yield the right of way to V1, which was already in the intersection. V2 was traveling eastbound and intended to continue straight through the intersection, while V1 was approaching the intersection from the north and had a stop sign. V2 should have noticed V1 and allowed it to clear the intersection before proceeding. However, V2 failed to judge the gap correctly and the speed of V1, resulting in the collision. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned that she noticed the other car pulling out from the roadway but was unable to steer enough to avoid the crash. This indicates that V2 had the opportunity to react and potentially avoid the collision but failed to do so. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to failure to yield the right of way and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed.
