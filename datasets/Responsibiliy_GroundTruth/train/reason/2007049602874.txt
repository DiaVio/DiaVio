The reason for this is that V1 was turning left at the intersection and failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic. The driver admitted to not seeing V2 approaching the intersection when he started his turn. This indicates that V1 did not exercise proper caution and failed to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic. On the other hand, V2 (the driver of the 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee) was driving within the speed limit, had a green light, and expected V1 to yield the right-of-way. Therefore, V2 cannot be held primarily responsible for the accident. In summary, V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield the right-of-way make them primarily responsible for the accident.
