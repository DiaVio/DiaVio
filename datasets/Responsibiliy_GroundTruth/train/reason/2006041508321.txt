The reason for V1's primary responsibility is as follows: - V1 was traveling at a speed of 72 kmph (45 mph), which is significantly higher than the posted speed limit of 40 kmph (25 mph). - V1 failed to stop at the stop sign, indicating an illegal maneuver. - Witnesses reported that the driver of V1 may have been racing other vehicles in the area, suggesting aggressive driving behavior. - The Critical Precrash Event for V1 was coded as other vehicle encroachment, indicating that V1 crossed the path of V2. - V1's failure to stop and excessive speed contributed to the collision with V2. Therefore, based on these factors, V1 is primarily responsible for the traffic accident.
