The driver of V1 admitted at the scene that he proceeded through the intersection without sufficient clearance and failed to adequately surveil the intersection. He overlooked Vehicle two (V2), which was closer to the intersection than the vehicle he saw. This indicates that V1's inadequate surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
