The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that he failed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of him and did not anticipate the stopped traffic ahead. He admitted to being distracted by looking to his left, which caused him to miss the fact that V2 was stopped in front of him. Additionally, the inspection of V1's vehicle revealed low tread depth and under-inflated tires, which would have increased the stopping distance on the wet roadway. While V2 (the driver of the Oldsmobile Delta 88) was also involved in the accident, the critical pre-crash event for V2 was coded as "other motor vehicle in lane, traveling in the same direction with higher speed." This suggests that V2 was not primarily responsible for the accident, as V1's failure to maintain a safe distance and react to the stopped traffic was the main contributing factor.
