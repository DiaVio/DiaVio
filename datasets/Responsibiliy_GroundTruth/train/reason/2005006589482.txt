The reason for this is that V1 was traveling southbound on the single lane roadway and contacted the left side of V2 (the 2003 Ford Crown Victoria marked police cruiser) which was traveling eastbound on the crossing one-way roadway. V1's initial impact with V2 caused V2 to lose control, blow out a tire, and subsequently collide with a fire hydrant and a concrete wall. Although the actual speed of the vehicles is unknown, a witness stated that the police vehicles were traveling at a high rate of speed through the intersection without stopping for the traffic lights. This suggests that V1, being a police vehicle on an emergency run, may have been disregarding the traffic signals and driving at a speed that contributed to the collision. Therefore, V1's failure to adhere to traffic signals and potentially driving at a high speed in an emergency situation makes them primarily responsible for the crash.
