The reason for this is that V1 was following too closely to respond to unexpected actions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event coded for V1. The driver's inexperience, being a seventeen-year-old female, was also identified as an associated factor in the crash. Additionally, V1 stated that she did not feel comfortable driving the vehicle and was thinking about shopping while driving, indicating a lack of focus and attention on the road. Therefore, V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance, lack of attention, and inexperience make them primarily responsible for the crash.
