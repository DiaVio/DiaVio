The reason for this is that V1 was traveling too fast for the wet and slick road conditions, as indicated by the critical pre-crash event and critical reason coded for V1. V1 lost control while attempting to merge into lane two, resulting in multiple rotations and ultimately crashing into the cement wall and then colliding with V2's trailer. Additionally, the driver of V1 fled the scene, which further suggests their responsibility for the accident.
