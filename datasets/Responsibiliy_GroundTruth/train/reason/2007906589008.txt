The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle two admitted that her view was obstructed by a cloud of steam from a vent, which prevented her from seeing the traffic approaching from her left. Despite stopping at the stop sign, she proceeded to make a left turn without having a clear view of the oncoming traffic. This action contributed to the collision with Vehicle one. While Vehicle one (the 1996 Chrysler Town and Country mini-van) was traveling at a relatively high speed and assumed that Vehicle two would continue through the intersection, the primary responsibility lies with Vehicle two for making a left turn without ensuring it was safe to do so. In summary, Vehicle two is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's obstructed view and failure to ensure the intersection was clear before making a left turn.
