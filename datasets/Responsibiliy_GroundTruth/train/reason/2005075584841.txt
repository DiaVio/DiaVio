The reason for this is that Vehicle one was making a left turn from a private driveway onto the southbound lane, and failed to yield the right of way to Vehicle two (1993 Honda Accord sedan) which was traveling straight in the westbound lane. Vehicle one proceeded with her turn and then stopped, assuming that Vehicle two would go around. However, Vehicle two did not have enough time or space to avoid the collision and ended up impacting the left side of Vehicle one. Therefore, Vehicle one's false assumption of Vehicle two's actions and failure to yield the right of way led to the accident.
