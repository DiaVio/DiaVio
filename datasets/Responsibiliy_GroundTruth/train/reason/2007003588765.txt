The driver of V2 failed to come to a complete stop before entering the intersection, even though the traffic signal was broken and stuck on yellow. Additionally, the driver of V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection by not looking to either side ahead. These actions contributed to the collision with V1 (the Scion TC) that was already in the intersection, obeying the red light and proceeding cautiously.
