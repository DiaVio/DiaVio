The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle One was attempting to make a left turn onto the westbound roadway from the northbound lane. The critical pre-crash event for Vehicle One was coded as "leaving driveway, turning left" and the critical reason was attributed to the driver's inadequate surveillance (looked but did not see). This indicates that the driver of Vehicle One failed to properly observe and assess the oncoming traffic, including Vehicle Two. On the other hand, the critical pre-crash event for Vehicle Two was coded as "other vehicle encroachment: from driveway, turning into opposite direction." This suggests that Vehicle Two was not at fault for the accident and was simply in the path of Vehicle One, which failed to yield the right of way. Therefore, based on the information provided, Vehicle One is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's inadequate surveillance while making a left turn.
