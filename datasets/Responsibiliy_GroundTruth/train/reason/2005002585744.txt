The reason for this is that Vehicle 1 struck the rear of Vehicle 2 (2002 GMC Envoy) while it was decelerating to avoid a non-contact vehicle making a left turn. The driver of Vehicle 1 admitted to taking his eyes off the road, indicating driver distraction as a contributing factor. Additionally, the police report mentioned driver inexperience and passenger distraction as further factors contributing to the crash.
