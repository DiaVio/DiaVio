The driver of V1 was driving aggressively, exceeding the posted speed limit and making a sudden lane change. This aggressive driving behavior, combined with the driver's lack of familiarity with the vehicle and the low tread depth of the front tires, contributed to the loss of control. The severe crosswinds present at the time of the accident may have also played a role. The witness statements further support the conclusion that V1 was traveling in a careless and reckless manner.
