The reason for this is that the driver of V1 overcompensated when the non-contact vehicle in lane three began to change lanes. Instead of maintaining control of the vehicle, the driver steered left and rotated V1 counterclockwise, causing it to depart the roadway and strike the jersey barrier. This overcompensation indicates a lack of proper judgment and control, making the driver primarily responsible for the accident. Additionally, the driver's fatigue, as stated by herself, could have contributed to her impaired judgment and reaction time.
