The reason for this is that V1 experienced a blowout of its right rear tire, causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. As a result, V1 yawed counterclockwise and departed the roadway, ultimately coming to rest in the median. While the driver's statement about the tire blowout and loss of control supports the fact that it was a vehicle-related factor, the driver could not be interviewed to determine if there were any other contributing factors. Therefore, based on the available information, V1 is considered primarily responsible for the accident.
