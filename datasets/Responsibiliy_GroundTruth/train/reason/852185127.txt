The reason for this is that V1 approached V2, the garbage truck, at a higher rate of speed and failed to brake and steer left in time to avoid the collision. This resulted in the front right of V1 impacting the back left of V2, causing V1 to under-ride V2 and leading to severe injuries for the front right passenger of V1.
