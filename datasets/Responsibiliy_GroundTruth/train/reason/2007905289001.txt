The reason for this is that V1 failed to stop behind V2 (the 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier) when the traffic flow was stopped due to a school bus discharging passengers. V2 was properly stopped in the roadway, as indicated by the driver's statement and the Critical Precrash Event code for V2. However, V1 failed to recognize the stopped vehicle and ran into the back of V2. Although it is uncertain if any fatigue or health-related factors contributed to the crash for V1, the primary responsibility lies with V1 for not stopping in time and causing the rear-end collision.
