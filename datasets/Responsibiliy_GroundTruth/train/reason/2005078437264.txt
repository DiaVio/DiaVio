The reason for V2's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before entering. Despite stopping at the stop sign and looking to the left and right, the driver did not see V1 approaching from the left. The driver's claim of a sight line restriction due to the ditch bank does not absolve them of responsibility, as they pulled forward to a point where the sight line was not restricted and still failed to notice V1. This lack of proper surveillance and failure to yield to oncoming traffic led to the collision.
