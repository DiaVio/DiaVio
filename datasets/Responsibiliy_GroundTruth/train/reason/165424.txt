The reason for this is that the driver of V2 reportedly lost consciousness and relinquished control of the vehicle, causing it to drift into the left westbound lane and collide with Vehicle three (V3). This initial impact then caused V3 to roll over and subsequently collide with Vehicle one (V1). Therefore, the loss of consciousness by the driver of V2 is the primary cause of the accident.
