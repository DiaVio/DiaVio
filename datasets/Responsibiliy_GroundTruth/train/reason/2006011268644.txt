The driver of V1 admitted to being distracted and looking down at the floor for a second, which caused the vehicle to veer off the roadway onto the gravel shoulder. Additionally, the driver made an incorrect evasive action by hitting the gas pedal instead of the brake, which resulted in the vehicle rotating counterclockwise, crossing the centerline, and ultimately impacting an embankment. The critical reason for the crash was a driver-related factor, specifically a recognition error due to internal distraction. The driver's pre-existing health condition of back pain and depression, along with the side effects of medication taken for depression, may have contributed to the driver's distraction and impaired judgment. While there were associated factors such as the vehicle's new front tires leaking air and the driver's strenuous labor the day before the crash, the primary responsibility lies with the driver of V1 due to her distracted driving and incorrect evasive action.
