The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn across the path of V2 (the 2003 Chevy Tahoe) without adequately surveilling the oncoming traffic. V1's driver reported that she did not see anyone coming before starting her left turn. This failure to properly observe the oncoming traffic and proceed with caution led to the collision with V2.
