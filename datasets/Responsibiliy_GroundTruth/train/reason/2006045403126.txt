The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 failed to yield the right of way to V2, who was already in the intersection and preparing to turn left. Despite V1 activating its right turn signal, V2 had the right of way as they were already in the intersection and V1 should have waited for V2 to complete their left turn before proceeding. V1's false assumption that V2 would yield the right of way and their failure to properly observe and react to the situation led to the collision.
