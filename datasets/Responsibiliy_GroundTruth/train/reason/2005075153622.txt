The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver failed to adequately survey the intersection before making a left turn. This is evident from the fact that V1's critical event was coded as "traveling, turning left at intersection" and the critical reason was attributed to V1 as "inadequate surveillance." The driver of V1 did not stop to yield the right of way to V2 (the Volvo XC70) and did not see V2 prior to making the left turn. Therefore, V1's failure to properly observe the intersection and yield the right of way to oncoming traffic led to the collision, making V1 primarily responsible for the accident.
