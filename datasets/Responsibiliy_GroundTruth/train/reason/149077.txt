The reason for this is that the driver of V1 fell asleep while driving, causing the vehicle to drift off the road. The driver's lack of attention and control resulted in V1 crossing the centerline, striking a mailbox post, and ultimately crashing into a tree. The driver's actions, specifically falling asleep at the wheel, directly led to the sequence of events that caused the accident.
