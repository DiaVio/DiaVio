The driver of V2 admitted to not stopping at the red light and proceeding through the intersection without noticing V1 until it was practically in front of him. This indicates a failure to obey traffic signals and exercise caution while driving. Additionally, the driver of V2 mentioned an obstructed view, which suggests a lack of attentiveness. Therefore, V2's failure to stop at the red light and failure to notice V1 are the main reasons for the accident.
