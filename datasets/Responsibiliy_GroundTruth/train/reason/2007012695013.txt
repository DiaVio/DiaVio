The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before entering it. The driver stated that he noticed cars ahead of him slowing down and speeding up, indicating that he was not paying close attention to the traffic signals. Additionally, he admitted that he was unsure if he had a green light before entering the intersection. V1, on the other hand, was already in the intersection waiting to turn left, which is a legal maneuver. The driver of V1 attempted to steer left to avoid the collision, indicating that he was aware of the oncoming vehicle and tried to take evasive action. Therefore, V2's failure to properly surveil the intersection and determine the status of the traffic signals led to the collision, making them primarily responsible for the accident.
