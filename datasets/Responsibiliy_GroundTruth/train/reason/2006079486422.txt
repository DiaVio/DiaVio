The reason for holding V1 primarily responsible is that V1 failed to maintain a safe following distance and collided with the back of V2 (the Mercury Cougar) after V2 had come to a stop to avoid hitting a non-contact vehicle that pulled out in front of it. V1's failure to maintain a safe following distance and react in time to the stopped V2 indicates a lack of attention or awareness on the part of V1, making them responsible for the collision.
