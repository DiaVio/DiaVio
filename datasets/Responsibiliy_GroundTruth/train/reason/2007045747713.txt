The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver admitted to falling asleep while driving, which led to the vehicle veering off the road on the right side. When the driver woke up, she overcompensated and lost control of the vehicle, causing it to cross the road and roll over before coming to rest. Factors contributing to V1's responsibility include driver fatigue, as the driver reported being tired, and driver behavior related to work-related stress, as she was required to work extended shifts as a firefighter. Additionally, the presence of various medications and poor tire tread on the rear tires may have also played a role. Overall, V1's driver falling asleep and overcompensating for the initial deviation from the road are the primary reasons for V1's responsibility in the accident.
