The reason for this is that the severe, far side impact was caused by the frontal plane of the Ford Ranger colliding with the Honda Civic. The impact resulted in significant intrusion of the right side components of the Honda Civic's interior, causing the case occupant to be projected mostly right within the vehicle. The injuries sustained by the case occupant, including the subarachnoid hemorrhage, contusions, fractures, and abrasions, were all likely a result of the impact with the intruding components of the Ford Ranger and the subsequent movement within the Honda Civic.
