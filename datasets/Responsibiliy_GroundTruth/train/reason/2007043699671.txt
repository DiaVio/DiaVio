The reason for this is that V2 turned right onto a one-way street in the wrong direction, directly into the path of V1 (the Chevrolet Express van). This action by V2 caused the head-on collision between the two vehicles. Additionally, it is mentioned that V2 appeared to have steered right in an attempt to avoid the collision, indicating that V2 recognized the mistake but was unable to prevent the accident. Therefore, V2's illegal maneuver and recognition error of turning onto a one-way street in the wrong direction make them primarily responsible for the accident.
