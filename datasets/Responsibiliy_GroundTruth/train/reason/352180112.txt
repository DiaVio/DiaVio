The reason for this is that the driver of Vehicle 1 experienced a medical condition while driving, causing the vehicle to veer right and collide with the back right corner of Vehicle 2 before departing the right roadside and ultimately crashing into a utility pole. The driver's medical condition likely impaired their ability to control the vehicle, leading to the collision.
