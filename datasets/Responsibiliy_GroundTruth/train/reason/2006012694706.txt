The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that the driver of V1 misjudged the gap or speed of Vehicle #2 (V2) and failed to decelerate in time to avoid striking the rear of V2. This is supported by the driver of V1 stating that she thought she saw brake lights on V2, but then realized it was too late to stop. Additionally, the driver of V1 was distracted by thinking about her upcoming surgery and wanting to get things in order, which contributed to her inattention and misjudgment. While V2 was traveling at a much slower speed than the speed limit, the driver of V2 was not intending to turn and was not aware of the presence of V1 behind her. The use of prescription medications and conversation with her passenger may have contributed to the driver of V2 not being fully aware of her surroundings, but these factors do not absolve V1 of responsibility for the crash. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's misjudgment of the gap or speed of V2 and inattention caused by thinking about her upcoming surgery.
