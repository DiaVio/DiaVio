The reason for this is that V1 was making a left turn at the intersection, which requires yielding to oncoming traffic. V2 (the driver of the 2004 Acura MDX) was traveling straight through the intersection and had the right of way. V1 falsely assumed that V2 would yield or stop, leading to the collision. Additionally, the critical reason for the event was attributed to V1 and coded as a driver-related decision error: false assumption of other's actions. This further supports the conclusion that V1 is primarily responsible for the accident.
