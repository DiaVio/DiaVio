The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver was distracted by reaching for his cell phone and failed to notice that V2 (the BMW 325XI) had stopped for the red traffic signal. This distraction caused V1 to not decelerate in time, resulting in the front of V1 colliding with the back of V2. Therefore, V1's failure to pay attention to the road and the traffic signal, due to being distracted by reaching for his cell phone, is the primary reason for the accident.
