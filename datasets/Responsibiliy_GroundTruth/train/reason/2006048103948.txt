The driver of V1 was arrested for driving under the influence, indicating that they were impaired at the time of the crash. Although no blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was recorded, the fact that the driver was arrested suggests that they were impaired by drugs or alcohol. Additionally, the driver of V1 admitted that they hit the rear of V2 (the 2002 Mercedes-Benz ML 320 SUV) while V2 was stopped with its left turn signal on. This indicates that V1 failed to maintain a safe distance and misjudged the gap or speed of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's impairment and misjudgment of the gap or other vehicle's speed.
