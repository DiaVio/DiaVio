The reason for this is that V1 was making a u-turn from the northbound lanes to the southbound lanes, which is a risky maneuver. V2 (the Plymouth Voyager mini van) was traveling in the second travel lane in the same direction and struck the rear of V1's trailer. V2 did not have enough time or opportunity to avoid the collision, indicating that V1's u-turn was the main cause of the crash. Additionally, V1's trailer lacked red/white reflective tape on the side, making it less visible to other drivers and contributing to the lack of avoidance by V2.
