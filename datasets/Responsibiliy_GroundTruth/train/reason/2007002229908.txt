The driver of V1 stated that he only saw V2 (the Toyota RAV-4) when he was about 20 feet from it and was unable to stop in time, resulting in the collision. The driver mentioned that the visibility was very poor due to white out conditions caused by blowing snow. Additionally, the slick roadway due to the snow-covered conditions contributed to the driver's inability to stop in time. While V2 was traveling in the same direction with a higher speed, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as the driver failed to maintain a safe distance and adjust their speed accordingly given the poor visibility and slick road conditions.
