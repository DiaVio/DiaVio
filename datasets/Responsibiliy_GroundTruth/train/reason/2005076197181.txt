The reason for this is that V2 failed to adequately surveil the intersection before proceeding through it. The driver of V2 did not have his headlights on, which likely impaired his visibility. Additionally, the driver claimed to speak no English and refused to be interviewed, suggesting a lack of cooperation. Furthermore, it was reported that the driver of V2 had been impaired by alcohol. These factors indicate that V2 was negligent in their actions, leading to the collision with V1.
