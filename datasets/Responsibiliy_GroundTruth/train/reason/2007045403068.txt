The driver of V1 admitted to traveling at a high speed of approximately 105 kmph/65 mph, which was too fast for the congested traffic conditions. He failed to anticipate the slowing traffic ahead and was unable to react in time to avoid colliding with V2's cargo unit. Additionally, the driver was engaged in other non-driving activities, specifically holding his pet while driving, which likely contributed to his inattention and inadequate surveillance of the road ahead. On the other hand, V2, the Sterling tractor-trailer, was traveling at a slower speed of 48-64 kmph/30-40 mph and was already slowing down due to the congestion. The driver of V2 checked his rearview mirrors and realized that V1 was approaching at a much higher speed, making it impossible for him to avoid being struck. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to the driver's excessive speed, inattention, inadequate surveillance, and failure to anticipate the slowing traffic ahead.
