The reason for this is that V2 allegedly proceeded into the intersection on a red traffic light, which indicates a violation of traffic laws. This action resulted in the collision with V1, the 1994 Buick Century, which was traveling through the intersection with a green light. Additionally, there is no information indicating any contributing factors or errors on the part of the driver of V1. The driver of V1 reported following traffic laws and being unable to react or maneuver due to freezing up, which suggests that the driver of V1 was not at fault for the accident. Therefore, based on the information provided, V2 is primarily responsible for the accident due to running a red light.
