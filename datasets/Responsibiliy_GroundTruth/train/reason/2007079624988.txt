The reason for V1's responsibility is that the driver of V1 was changing lanes to the right while negotiating a curve. This action, combined with the tread separation of the left rear tire, caused V1 to lose control and veer across all lanes towards the west edge shoulder. The driver's inexperience may have also contributed to the inability to properly handle the situation. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the collision due to the driver's lane change and the tire failure.
