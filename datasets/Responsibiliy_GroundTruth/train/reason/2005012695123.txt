The reason for V2's primary responsibility is that she was traveling at a high speed of 76 mph, which is above the posted speed limit of 45 mph. This excessive speed contributed to the critical pre-crash event of encroaching into the opposite lane over the left lane line, resulting in the collision with V1. Additionally, V2 stated that she had just passed another vehicle and was in lane one when she saw V1 edging forward to make a left turn. Despite seeing V1, V2 did not have enough time to react and avoid the collision, indicating a failure to exercise proper caution and judgment while driving.
