The reason for V1's primary responsibility is that it struck the rear of Vehicle 2 (V2), the transit bus. V1 was traveling behind V2 and failed to maintain a safe distance or react in time to avoid the collision. Additionally, the fact that V1's front-end under-rode the rear of V2 suggests that V1 was likely traveling at a higher speed than V2, further indicating V1's failure to exercise proper caution and control. It is important to note that the driver of V1 was also unrestrained, which may have contributed to the severity of their injuries. However, the primary responsibility for the accident still lies with V1 due to their failure to maintain a safe distance and avoid colliding with the rear of V2.
