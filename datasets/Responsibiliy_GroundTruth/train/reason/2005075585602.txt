The driver of V1 initiated a left turn from the westbound lane into the eastbound lane, which resulted in a collision with Vehicle #2 (V2) traveling in the opposite direction. The critical reason for V1 is inadequate surveillance, indicating that the driver failed to properly observe the oncoming traffic before making the left turn. This failure to look or look but not see the approaching vehicle in the eastbound lane led to the collision. Additionally, there are associative factors that contribute to V1's responsibility. The driver of V1 was heading towards the sun, which was bright and relatively low in the sky. This could have potentially affected the driver's visibility and made it more challenging to accurately assess the oncoming traffic. Furthermore, the driver of V1 was also distracted by her thought process, as she was on her way to the store to use a coupon received in the mail. This distraction may have diverted her attention from the task of driving and contributed to the inadequate surveillance. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to the driver's failure to adequately observe the oncoming traffic while making a left turn, as well as the presence of associative factors such as sun glare and driver distraction.
