The driver of V1 admitted to not stopping prior to making a left turn and stated that he did not see any approaching vehicles. He also mentioned that the crest in the road east of the intersection blocked his view of oncoming traffic. Additionally, he admitted to looking at his girlfriend in the rearview mirror just before turning. These factors indicate that the driver of V1 failed to adequately survey the intersection and did not take proper evasive actions. While V2 (the Chevy Silverado) was traveling over the speed limit, the primary responsibility lies with V1 as they failed to yield the right of way and turned across the path of V2. V2's driver claimed that she did not see V1 prior to impact and braked without lockup, indicating that she made an attempt to avoid the collision. In summary, V1 is primarily responsible for the crash due to inadequate surveillance, failure to yield, and not taking proper evasive actions.
