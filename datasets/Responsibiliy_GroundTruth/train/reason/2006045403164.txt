The driver of V2 stated that they were in the left turn only lane behind a tractor trailer, intending to turn left into the driveway of the truck stop. However, they failed to adequately surveil the oncoming traffic and did not see V1 (the 2002 Dodge Dakota) approaching from the opposite direction. This failure to look and see the oncoming vehicle resulted in V2 turning into the path of V1, causing the collision.
