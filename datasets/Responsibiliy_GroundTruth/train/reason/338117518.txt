The reason for this is that V1 pulled out into the roadway without yielding to oncoming traffic, specifically vehicle V2, the 2003 Ford Windstar minivan. This failure to yield resulted in the collision between the left front fender of V1 and the front plane of V2. Therefore, V1 is primarily responsible for the accident due to their failure to yield the right of way.
