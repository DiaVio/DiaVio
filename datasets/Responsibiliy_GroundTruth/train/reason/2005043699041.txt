The critical pre-crash event for V1 was turning left at an intersection, and the critical reason for this event was inadequate surveillance. V1 failed to confirm that the roadway was clear before making the left turn. This is supported by the fact that V1 did not see V2 until they collided. Additionally, V1 made a false assumption that the way was clear for him because a "Good Samaritan" driver waved him on. Therefore, V1's failure to adequately surveil the roadway and his false assumption contributed to the accident, making him primarily responsible.
