The driver of V1 failed to notice the traffic signal change from green to red, indicating that he was not paying sufficient attention to the road ahead. This internal distraction, combined with the driver's conversation with his passengers, caused him to be unaware of the changing signal and resulted in him slamming on the brakes at the last moment. This sudden braking caused the vehicle to lose control and roll over. Therefore, the driver's failure to observe the traffic signal and his internal distraction are the main reasons for the accident.
